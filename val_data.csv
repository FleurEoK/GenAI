10992,7246,"<line> <line>lo i the man, whose muse whilome did maske, as time her taught in lowly shepheards weeds, am now enforst a far unfitter taske, for trumpets sterne to chaunge mine oaten reeds, and sing of knights and ladies gentle deeds; whose prayses having slept in silence long, me, all too meane, the sacred muse areeds to blazon broad emongst her learned throng: fierce warres and faithful loves shall moralize my song. helpe then, o holy virgin chiefe of nine, thy weaker novice to performe thy will, lay forth out of thine everlasting scryne the antique rolles, which there lye hidden still, of faerie knights and fairest tanaquill, whom that most noble briton prince so long sought through the world, and suffered so much ill, that i must rue his undeserved wrong: o helpe thou my weake wit, and sharpen my dull tong. and thou most dreaded impe of highest jove, faire venus sonne, that with thy cruell dart at that good knight so cunningly didst rove, that glorious fire it kindled in his hart, lay now thy deadly heben bow apart, and with thy mother milde come to mine ayde: come both, and with you bring triumphant mart, in loves and gentle jollities arrayd, after his murdrous spoiles and bloudy rage allayd. and with them eke, o goddesse heavenly bright, mirrour of grace and majestie divine, great lady of the greatest isle, whose light like phoebus lampe throughout the world doth shine, shed thy faire beames into my feeble eyne, and raise my thoughts too humble and too vile, to thinke of that true glorious type of thine, the argument of mine afflicted stile: the which to heare, vouchsafe, o dearest dred a-while. i a gentle knight was pricking on the plaine, y cladd in mightie armes and silver shielde, wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remaine, the cruell markes of many a bloudy fielde; yet armes till that time did he never wield: his angry steede did chide his foming bitt, as much disdayning to the curbe to yield: full jolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt, as one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt. ii but on his brest a bloudie crosse he bore, the deare remembrance of his dying lord, for whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore, and dead as living ever him ador'd: upon his shield the like was also scor'd, for soveraine hope, which in his helpe he had: right faithfull true he was in deede and word, but of his cheere did seeme too solemne sad; yet nothing did he dread, but ever was ydrad. iii upon a great adventure he was bond, that greatest gloriana to him gave, that greatest glorious queene of faerie lond, to winne him worship, and her grace to have, which of all earthly things he most did crave; and ever as he rode, his hart did earne to prove his puissance in battell brave upon his foe, and his new force to learne; upon his foe, a dragon horrible and stearne. iv a lovely ladie rode him faire beside, upon a lowly asse more white then snow, yet she much whiter, but the same did hide under a vele, that wimpled was full low, and over all a blacke stole she did throw, as one that inly mournd: so was she sad, and heavie sat upon her palfrey slow; seemed in heart some hidden care she had, and by her in a line a milke white lambe she lad. v so pure an innocent, as that same lambe, she was in life and every vertuous lore, and by descent from royall lynage came of ancient kings and queenes, that had of yore their scepters stretcht from east to westerne shore, and all the world in their subjection held; till that infernall feend with foule uprore forwasted all their land, and them expeld: whom to avenge, she had this knight from far compeld. vi behind her farre away a dwarfe did lag, that lasie seemd in being ever last, or wearied with bearing of her bag of needments at his backe. thus as they past, the day with cloudes was suddeine overcast, and angry jove an hideous storme of raine did poure into his lemans lap so fast, that every wight to shrowd it did constrain, and this faire couple eke to shroud themselves were fain. vii enforst to seeke some covert nigh at hand, a shadie grove not far away they spide, that promist ayde the tempest to withstand: whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride, did spred so broad, that heavens light did hide, not perceable with power of any starre: and all within were pathes and alleies wide, with footing worne, and leading inward farre: faire harbour that them seemes; so in they entred arre. viii and foorth they passe, with pleasure forward led, joying to heare the birdes sweete harmony, which therein shrouded from the tempest dred, seemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky. much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy, the sayling pine, the cedar proud and tall, the vine-prop elme, the poplar never dry, the builder oake, sole king of forrests all, the aspine good for staves, the cypresse funerall. ix the laurell, meed of mightie conquerours and poets sage, the firre that weepeth still, the willow worne of forlorne paramours, the eugh obedient to the benders will, the birch for shaftes, the sallow for the mill, the mirrhe sweete bleeding in the bitter wound, the warlike beech, the ash for nothing ill, the fruitfull olive, and the platane round, the carver holme, the maple seeldom inward sound. x led with delight, they thus beguile the way, untill the blustring storme is overblowne; when weening to returne, whence they did stray, they cannot find that path, which first was showne, but wander too and fro in wayes unknowne, furthest from end then, when they neerest weene, that makes them doubt, their wits be not their owne: so many pathes, so many turnings seene, that which of them to take, in diverse doubt they been. xi at last resolving forward still to fare, till that some end they finde or in or out, that path they take, that beaten seemd most bare, and like to lead the labyrinth about; which when by tract they hunted had throughout, at length it brought them to a hollow cave, amid the thickest woods. the champion stout eftsoones dismounted from his courser brave, and to the dwarfe a while his needlesse spere he gave. xii be well aware, quoth then that ladie milde, least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash provoke: the danger hid, the place unknowne and wilde, breeds dreadfull doubts: oft fire is without smoke, and perill without show: therefore your stroke sir knight with-hold, till further triall made. ah ladie (said he) shame were to revoke the forward footing for an hidden shade: vertue gives her selfe light, through darkenesse for to wade. xiii yea but (quoth she) the perill of this place i better wot then you, though now too late to wish you backe returne with foule disgrace, yet wisedome warnes, whilest foot is in the gate, to stay the steppe, ere forced to retrate. this is the wandring wood, this errours den, a monster vile, whom god and man does hate: therefore i read beware. fly fly (quoth then the fearefull dwarfe:) this is no place for living men. xiv but full of fire and greedy hardiment, the youthfull knight could not for ought be staide, but forth unto the darksome hole he went, and looked in: his glistring armor made a litle glooming light, much like a shade, by which he saw the ugly monster plaine, halfe like a serpent horribly displaide, but th'other halfe did womans shape retaine, most lothsom, filthie, foule, and full of vile disdaine. xv and as she lay upon the durtie ground, her huge long taile her den all overspred, yet was in knots and many boughtes upwound, pointed with mortall sting. of her there bred a thousand yong ones, which she dayly fed, sucking upon her poisonous dugs, eachone of sundry shapes, yet all ill favored: soone as that uncouth light upon them shone, into her mouth they crept, and suddain all were gone. xvi their dam upstart, out of her den effraide, and rushed forth, hurling her hideous taile about her cursed head, whose folds displaid were stretcht now forth at length without entraile. she lookt about, and seeing one in mayle armed to point, sought backe to turne againe; for light she hated as the deadly bale, ay wont in desert darknesse to remaine, where plaine none might her see, nor she see any plaine. xvii which when the valiant elfe perceiv'd, he lept as lyon fierce upon the flying pray, and with his trenchand blade her boldly kept from turning backe, and forced her to stay: therewith enrag'd she loudly gan to bray, and turning fierce, her speckled taile advaunst, threatning her angry sting, him to dismay: who nought aghast, his mightie hand enhaunst: the stroke down from her head unto her shoulder glaunst. xviii much daunted with that dint, her sence was dazd, yet kindling rage, her selfe she gathered round, and all attonce her beastly body raizd with doubled forces high above the ground: tho wrapping up her wrethed sterne arownd, lept fierce upon his shield, and her huge traine all suddenly about his body wound, that hand or foot to stirre he strove in vaine: god helpe the man so wrapt in errours endlesse traine. xix his lady sad to see his sore constraint, cride out, now now sir knight, shew what ye bee, add faith unto your force, and be not faint: strangle her, else she sure will strangle thee. that when he heard, in great perplexitie, his gall did grate for griefe and high disdaine, and knitting all his force got one hand free, wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine, that soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine. xx therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw a floud of poyson horrible and blacke, full of great lumpes of flesh and gobbets raw, which stunck so vildly, that it forst him slacke his grasping hold, and from her turne him backe: her vomit full of bookes and papers was, with loathly frogs and toades, which eyes did lacke, and creeping sought way in the weedy gras: her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has. xxi as when old father nilus gins to swell with timely pride above the aegyptian vale, his fattie waves do fertile slime outwell, and overflow each plaine and lowly dale: but when his later spring gins to avale, huge heapes of mudd he leaves, wherein there breed ten thousand kindes of creatures, partly male and partly female of his fruitfull seed; such ugly monstrous shapes elsewhere may no man reed. xxii the same so sore annoyed has the knight, that welnigh choked with the deadly stinke, his forces faile, ne can no longer fight. whose corage when the feend perceiv'd to shrinke, she poured forth out of her hellish sinke her fruitfull cursed spawne of serpents small, deformed monsters, fowle, and blacke as inke, which swarming all about his legs did crall, and him encombred sore, but could not hurt at all. xxiii as gentle shepheard in sweete even-tide, when ruddy phoebus gins to welke in west, high on an hill, his flocke to vewen wide, markes which do byte their hasty supper best; a cloud of combrous gnattes do him molest, all striving to infixe their feeble stings, that from their noyance he no where can rest, but with his clownish hands their tender wings he brusheth oft, and oft doth mar their murmurings. xxiv thus ill bestedd, and fearefull more of shame, then of the certaine perill he stood in, halfe furious unto his foe he came, resolv'd in minde all suddenly to win, or soone to lose, before he once would lin; and strooke at her with more then manly force, that from her body full of filthie sin he raft her hatefull head without remorse; a streame of cole black bloud forth gushed from her corse. xxv her scattred brood, soone as their parent deare they saw so rudely falling to the ground, groning full deadly, all with troublous feare, gathred themselves about her body round, weening their wonted entrance to have found at her wide mouth: but being there withstood they flocked all about her bleeding wound, and sucked up their dying mothers blood, making her death their life, and eke her hurt their good. xxvi that detestable sight him much amazde, to see th'unkindly impes of heaven accurst, devoure their dam; on whom while so he gazd, having all satisfide their bloudy thurst, their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst, and bowels gushing forth: well worthy end of such as drunke her life, the which them nurst; now needeth him no lenger labour spend, his foes have slaine themselves, with whom he should contend. xxvii his ladie seeing all, that chaunst, from farre approcht in hast to greet his victorie, and said, faire knight, borne under happy starre, who see your vanquisht foes before you lye: well worthy be you of that armorie, wherein ye have great glory wonne this day, and proov'd your strength on a strong enimie, your first adventure: many such i pray, and henceforth ever wish, that like succeed it may. xxviii then mounted he upon his steede againe, and with the lady backward sought to wend; that path he kept, which beaten was most plame, ne ever would to any by-way bend, but still did follow one unto the end, the which at last out of the wood them brought. so forward on his way (with god to frend) he passed forth, and new adventure sought; long way he travelled, before he heard of ought. xxix at length they chaunst to meet upon the way an aged sire, in long blacke weedes yclad, his feete all bare, his beard all hoarie gray, and by his belt his booke he hanging had; sober he seemde, and very sagely sad, and to the ground his eyes were lowly bent, simple in shew, and voyde of malice bad, and all the way he prayed, as he went, and often knockt his brest, as one that did repent. xxx he faire the knight saluted, louting low, who faire him quited, as that courteous was: and after asked him, if he did know of straunge adventures, which abroad did pas. ah my deare sonne (quoth he) how should, alas, silly old man, that lives in hidden cell, bidding his beades all day for his trespas, tydings of warre and worldly trouble tell? with holy father sits not with such things to mell. xxxi but if of daunger which hereby doth dwell, and homebred evill ye desire to heare, of a straunge man i can you tidings tell, that wasteth all this countrey farre and neare. of such (said he) i chiefly do inquere, and shall you well reward to shew the place, in which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare: for to all knighthood it is foule disgrace, that such a cursed creature lives so long a space. xxxii far hence (quoth he) in wastfull wildernesse his dwelling is, by which no living wight may ever passe, but thorough great distresse. now (sayd the lady) draweth toward night, and well i wote, that of your later fight ye all forwearied be: for what so strong, but wanting rest will also want of might? the sunne that measures heaven all day long, at night doth baite his steedes the ocean waves emong. xxxiii then with the sunne take sir, your timely rest, and with new day new worke at once begin: untroubled night they say gives counsell best. right well sir knight ye have advised bin, (quoth then that aged man;) the way to win is wisely to advise: now day is spent; therefore with me ye may take up your in for this same night. the knight was well content: so with that godly father to his home they went. xxxiv a little lowly hermitage it was, downe in a dale, hard by a forests side, far from resort of people, that did pas in travell to and froe: a little wyde there was an holy chappell edifyde, wherein the hermite dewly wont to say his holy things each morne and eventyde: thereby a christall streame did gently play, which from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway. xxxv arrived there, the little house they fill, ne looke for entertainement, where none was: rest is their feast, and all things at their will; the noblest mind the best contentment has. with faire discourse the evening so they pas: for that old man of pleasing wordes had store, and well could file his tongue as smooth as glas; he told of saintes and popes, and evermore he strowd an ave-mary after and before. xxxvi the drouping night thus creepeth on them fast, and the sad humour loading their eye liddes, as messenger of morpheus on them cast sweet slombring deaw, the which to sleepe them biddes. unto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes: where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes, he to his study goes, and there amiddes his magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes, he seekes out mighty charmes, to trouble sleepy mindes. xxxvii then choosing out few wordes most horrible, (let none them read) thereof did verses frame, with which and other spelles like terrible, he bad awake blacke plutoes griesly dame, and cursed heaven, and spake reprochfull shame of highest god, the lord of life and light; a bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name great gorgon, prince of darknesse and dead night, at which cocytus quakes, and styx is put to flight. xxxviii and forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred legions of sprights, the which like little flyes fluttring about his ever damned hed, a-waite whereto their service he applyes, to aide his friends, or fray his enimies: of those he chose out two, the falsest twoo, and fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes; the one of them he gave a message too, the other by him selfe staide other worke to doo. xxxix he making speedy way through spersed ayre, and through the world of waters wide and peepe, to morpheus house doth hastily repaire. amid the bowels of the earth full steepe, and low, where dawning day doth never peepe, his dwelling is; there tethys his wet bed doth ever wash, and cynthia still doth steepe in silver deaw his ever-drouping hed, whiles sad night over him her mantle black doth spred. xl whose double gates he findeth locked fast, the one faire fram'd of burnisht yvory, the other all with silver overcast; and wakefull dogges before them farre do lye watching to banish care their enimy, who oft is wont to trouble gentle sleepe. by them the sprite doth passe in quietly, and unto morpheus comes, whom drowned deepe in drowsie fit he findes: of nothing he takes keepe. xli and more, to lulle him in his slumber soft, a trickling streame from high rocke tumbling downe and ever-drizling raine upon the loft, mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne of swarming bees, did cast him in a swowne: no other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes, as still are wont t'annoy the walled towne, might there be heard: but carelesse quiet lyes, wrapt in eternall silence farre from enemyes. xlii the messenger approching to him spake, but his wast wordes returnd to him in vaine: so sound he slept, that nought mought him awake. then rudely he him thrust, and pusht with paine, whereat he gan to stretch: but he againe shooke him so hard, that forced him to speake. as one then in a dreame, whose dryer braine in tost with troubled sights and fancies weake, he mumbled soft, but would not all his silence breake. xliii the sprite then gan more boldly him to wake, and threatned unto him the dreaded name of hecate: whereat he gan to quake, and lifting up his lumpish head, with blame halfe angry asked him, for what he came. hither (quoth he) me archimago sent, he that the stubborne sprites can wisely tame, he bids thee to him send for his intent a fit false dreame, that can delude the sleepers sent. xliv the god obayde, and calling forth straight way a diverse dreame out of his prison darke, delivered it to him, and downe did lay his heavie head, devoide of carefull carke, whose sences all were straight benumbed and starke. he backe returning by the yvorie dore, remounted up as light as chearefull larke, and on his litle winges the dreame he bore in hast unto his lord, where he him left afore. xlv who all this while with charmes and hidden artes, had made a lady of that other spright, and fram'd of liquid ayre her tender partes so lively, and so like in all mens sight, that weaker sence it could have ravisht quight: the maker selfe for all his wondrous witt, was nigh beguiled with so goodly sight: her all in white he clad, and over it cast a blacke stole, most like to seeme for una fit. xlvi now when that ydle dreame was to him brought, unto that elfin knight he bad him fly, where he slept soundly void of evill thought and with false shewes abuse his fantasy, in sort as he him schooled privily: and that new creature borne without her dew, full of the makers guile, with usage sly he taught to imitate that lady trew, whose semblance she did carrie under feigned hew. xlvii thus well instructed, to their worke they hast, and comming where the knight in slomber lay, the one upon his hardy head him plast, and made him dreame of loves and lustfull play, that nigh his manly hart did melt away, bathed in wanton blis and wicked joy: then seemed him his lady by him lay, and to him playnd, how that false winged boy, her chast hart had subdewd, to learne dame pleasures toy. xlviii and she her selfe of beautie soveraigne queene, faire venus seemde unto his bed to bring her, whom he waking evermore did weene, to be the chastest flowre, that ay did spring on earthly braunch, the daughter of a king, now a loose leman to vile service bound: and eke the graces seemed all to sing, hymen {i}{_o} hymen, dauncing all around, while freshest flora her with yvie girlond crownd. xlix in this great passion of unwonted lust, or wonted feare of doing ought amis, he started up, as seeming to mistrust some secret ill, or hidden foe of his: lo there before his face his lady is, under blake stole hyding her bayted hooke, and as halfe blushing offred him to kis, with gentle blandishment and lovely looke, most like that virgin true, which for her knight him took. l all cleane dismayd to see so uncouth sight, and halfe enraged at her shamelesse guise, he thought have slaine her in his fierce despight: but hasty heat tempring with sufferance wise, he stayde his hand, and gan himselfe advise to prove his sense, and tempt her faigned truth. wringing her hands in wemens pitteous wise, tho can she weepe, to stirre up gentle ruth, both for her noble bloud, and for her tender youth. li and said, ah sir, my liege lord and my love, shall i accuse the hidden cruell fate, and mightie causes wrought in heaven above, or the blind god, that doth me thus amate, for hoped love to winne me certaine hate? yet thus perforce he bids me do, or die. die is my dew: yet rew my wretched state you, whom my hard avenging destinie hath made judge of my life or death indifferently. lii your owne deare sake forst me at first to leave my fathers kingdome, there she stopt with teares;

horror and doubt distract his troubl'd thoughts, and from the bottom stirr the hell within him, for within him hell he brings, and round about him, nor from hell one step no more then from himself can fly by change of place: now conscience wakes despair that slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie of what he was, what is, and what must be worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue. sometimes towards eden which now in his view lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad, sometimes towards heav'n and the full-blazing sun, which now sat high in his meridian towre: then much revolving, thus in sighs began. o thou that with surpassing glory crownd, look'st from thy sole dominion like the god of this new world; at whose sight all the starrs hide thir diminisht heads; to thee i call, but with no friendly voice, and add thy name o sun, to tell thee how i hate thy beams that bring to my remembrance from what state i fell, how glorious once above thy spheare; till pride and worse ambition threw me down warring in heav'n against heav'ns matchless king: ah wherefore! he deservd no such return from me, whom he created what i was in that bright eminence, and with his good upbraided none; nor was his service hard. what could be less then to afford him praise, the easiest recompence, and pay him thanks, how due! yet all his good prov'd ill in me, and wrought but malice; lifted up so high i sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher would set me highest, and in a moment quit the debt immense of endless gratitude, so burthensome still paying, still to ow; forgetful what from him i still receivd, and understood not that a grateful mind by owing owes not, but still pays, at once indebted and dischargd; what burden then? o had his powerful destiny ordaind me some inferiour angel, i had stood then happie; no unbounded hope had rais'd ambition. yet why not? som other power as great might have aspir'd, and me though mean drawn to his part; but other powers as great fell not, but stand unshak'n, from within or from without, to all temptations arm'd. hadst thou the same free will and power to stand? thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse, but heav'ns free love dealt equally to all? be then his love accurst, since love or hate, to me alike, it deals eternal woe. nay curs'd be thou; since against his thy will chose freely what it now so justly rues. me miserable! which way shall i flie infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire? which way i flie is hell; my self am hell; and in the lowest deep a lower deep still threatning to devour me opens wide, to which the hell i suffer seems a heav'n. o then at last relent: is there no place left for repentance, none for pardon left? none left but by submission; and that word disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame among the spirits beneath, whom i seduc'd with other promises and other vaunts then to submit, boasting i could subdue th' omnipotent. ay me, they little know how dearly i abide that boast so vaine, under what torments inwardly i groane; while they adore me on the throne of hell, with diadem and scepter high advanc'd the lower still i fall, onely supream in miserie; such joy ambition findes. but say i could repent and could obtaine by act of grace my former state; how soon would higth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay what feign'd submission swore: ease would recant vows made in pain, as violent and void. for never can true reconcilement grow where wounds of deadly hate have peirc'd so deep: which would but lead me to a worse relapse and heavier fall: so should i purchase deare short intermission bought with double smart. this knows my punisher; therefore as farr from granting hee, as i from begging peace: all hope excluded thus, behold in stead of us out-cast, exil'd, his new delight, mankind created, and for him this world. so farwel hope, and with hope farwel fear, farwel remorse: all good to me is lost; evil be thou my good; by thee at least divided empire with heav'ns king i hold by thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne; as man ere long, and this new world shall know. thus while he spake, each passion dimm'd his face thrice chang'd with pale, ire, envie and despair, which marrd his borrow'd visage, and betraid him counterfet, if any eye beheld. for heav'nly mindes from such distempers foule are ever cleer. whereof hee soon aware, each perturbation smooth'd with outward calme, artificer of fraud; and was the first that practisd falshood under saintly shew, deep malice to conceale, couch't with revenge: yet not anough had practisd to deceive uriel once warnd; whose eye pursu'd him down the way he went, and on th' assyrian mount saw him disfigur'd, more then could befall spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce he markd and mad demeanour, then alone, as he suppos'd, all unobserv'd, unseen. so on he fares, and to the border comes, of eden, where delicious paradise, now nearer, crowns with her enclosure green, as with a rural mound the champain head of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides with thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde, access deni'd; and over head up grew insuperable highth of loftiest shade, cedar, and pine, and firr, and branching palm, a silvan scene, and as the ranks ascend shade above shade, a woodie theatre of stateliest view. yet higher then thir tops the verdurous wall of paradise up sprung: which to our general sire gave prospect large into his neather empire neighbouring round. and higher then that wall a circling row of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit, blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt: on which the sun more glad impress'd his beams then in fair evening cloud, or humid bow, when god hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd that lantskip: and of pure now purer aire meets his approach, and to the heart inspires vernal delight and joy, able to drive all sadness but despair: now gentle gales fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole those balmie spoiles. as when to them who saile beyond the cape of hope, and now are past mozambic, off at sea north-east windes blow sabean odours from the spicie shoare of arabie the blest, with such delay well pleas'd they slack thir course, and many a league chear'd with the grateful smell old ocean smiles. so entertaind those odorous sweets the fiend who came thir bane, though with them better pleas'd then asmodeus with the fishie fume, that drove him, though enamourd, from the spouse of tobits son, and with a vengeance sent from media post to aegypt, there fast bound. now to th' ascent of that steep savage hill satan had journied on, pensive and slow; but further way found none, so thick entwin'd, as one continu'd brake, the undergrowth of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext all path of man or beast that past that way: one gate there only was, and that look'd east on th' other side: which when th' arch-fellon saw due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt, at one slight bound high over leap'd all bound of hill or highest wall, and sheer within lights on his feet. as when a prowling wolfe, whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, watching where shepherds pen thir flocks at eeve in hurdl'd cotes amid the field secure, leaps o're the fence with ease into the fould:. or as a thief bent to unhoord the cash of some rich burgher, whose substantial dores, cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault, in at the window climbs, or o're the tiles; so clomb this first grand thief into gods fould: so since into his church lewd hirelings climbe. thence up he flew, and on the tree of life, the middle tree and highest there that grew, sat like a cormorant; yet not true life thereby regaind, but sat devising death to them who liv'd; nor on the vertue thought of that life-giving plant, but only us'd for prospect, what well us'd had bin the pledge of immortality. so little knows any, but god alone, to value right the good before him, but perverts best things to worst abuse, or to thir meanest use. beneath him with new wonder now he views to all delight of human sense expos'd in narrow room natures whole wealth, yea more, a heav'n on earth, for blissful paradise of god the garden was, by him in the east of eden planted; eden stretchd her line from auran eastward to the royal towrs of great seleucia, built by grecian kings, or where the sons of eden long before dwelt in telassar: in this pleasant soile his farr more pleasant garden god ordaind; out of the fertil ground he caus'd to grow all trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; and all amid them stood the tree of life, high eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit of vegetable gold; and next to life our death the tree of knowledge grew fast by, knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill. southward through eden went a river large, nor chang'd his course, but through the shaggie hill pass'd underneath ingulft, for god had thrown that mountain as his garden mould high rais'd upon the rapid current, which through veins of porous earth with kindly thirst up drawn, rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill waterd the garden; thence united fell down the steep glade, and met the neather flood, which from his darksom passage now appeers, and now divided into four main streams, runs divers, wandring many a famous realme and country whereof here needs no account, but rather to tell how, if art could tell, how from that saphire fount the crisped brooks, rowling on orient pearl and sands of gold, with mazie error under pendant shades ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed flours worthy of paradise which not nice art in beds and curious knots, but nature boon powrd forth profuse on hill and dale and plaine, both where the morning sun first warmly smote the open field, and where the unpierc't shade lmbround the noontide bowrs: thus was this place, a happy rural seat of various view; groves whose rich trees wept odorous gumms and balme, others whose fruit burnisht with golden rinde hung amiable, hesperian fables true, if true, here only, and of delicious taste: betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks grasing the tender herb, were interpos'd, or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap of som irriguous valley spred her store, flours of all hue, and without thorn the rose: another side, umbrageous grots and caves of coole recess, o're which the mantling vine layes forth her purple grape, and gently creeps luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall down the slope hills, disperst, or in a lake, that to the fringed bank with myrtle crownd, her chrystal mirror holds, unite thir streams. the birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires, breathing the smell of field and grove, attune the trembling leaves, while universal pan knit with the graces and the hours in dance led on th' eternal spring. not that faire field of enna, where proserpin gathering flours her self a fairer floure by gloomie dis was gatherd, which cost ceres all that pain to seek her through the world; nor that sweet grove of daphne by orontes, and th' inspir'd castalian spring, might with this paradise of eden strive; nor that nyseian ile girt with the river triton, where old cham, whom gentiles ammon call and lybian jove, hid amalthea and her florid son young bacchus from his stepdame rhea's eye; nor where abassin kings thir issue guard, mount amara, though this by som suppos'd true paradise under the ethiop line by nilus head, enclosd with shining rock, a whole days journy high, but wide remote from this assyrian garden, where the fiend saw undelighted all delight, all kind of living creatures new to sight and strange: two of far nobler shape erect and tall, godlike erect, with native honour clad in naked majestie seemd lords of all, and worthie seemd, for in thir looks divine the image of thir glorious maker shon, truth, wisdome, sanctitude severe and pure, severe but in true filial freedom plac't; whence true autoritie in men; though both not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd; for contemplation hee and valour formd, for softness shee and sweet attractive grace, hee for god only, shee for god in him: his fair large front and eye sublime declar'd absolute rule; and hyacinthin locks round from his parted forelock manly hung clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad: shee as a vail down to the slender waste her unadorned golden tresses wore dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav'd as the vine curles her tendrils, which impli'd subjection, but requir'd with gentle sway, and by her yielded, by him best receivd, yielded with coy submission, modest pride, and sweet reluctant amorous delay. nor those mysterious parts were then conceald, then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame of natures works, honor dishonorable, sin-bred, how have ye troubl'd all mankind with shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure, and banisht from mans life his happiest life, simplicitie and spotless innocence. so passd they naked on, nor shund the sight of god or angel, for they thought no ill: so hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair that ever since in loves imbraces met, adam the goodliest man of men since borne his sons, the fairest of her daughters eve. under a tuft of shade that on a green stood whispering soft, by a fresh fountain side they sat them down, and after no more toil of thir sweet gardning labour then suffic'd to recommend coole zephyr, and made ease more easie, wholsom thirst and appetite more grateful, to thir supper fruits they fell, nectarine fruits which the compliant boughes yielded them, side-long as they sat recline on the soft downie bank damaskt with flours: the savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream; nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial league, alone as they. about them frisking playd all beasts of th' earth, since wilde, and of all chase in wood or wilderness, forrest or den; sporting the lion rampd, and in his paw dandl'd the kid; bears, tygers, ounces, pards, gambold before them, th' unwieldy elephant to make them mirth us'd all his might, and wreathd his lithe proboscis; close the serpent sly insinuating, wove with gordian twine his breaded train, and of his fatal guile gave proof unheeded; others on the grass coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat, or bedward ruminating: for the sun declin'd was hasting now with prone carreer to th' ocean iles, and in th' ascending scale of heav'n the starrs that usher evening rose: when satan still in gaze, as first he stood, scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad. o hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold, into our room of bliss thus high advanc't creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps, not spirits, yet to heav'nly spirits bright little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue with wonder, and could love, so lively shines in them divine resemblance, and such grace the hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd. ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh your change approaches, when all these delights will vanish and deliver ye to woe, more woe, the more your taste is now of joy; happie, but for so happie ill secur'd long to continue, and this high seat your heav'n ill fenc't for heav'n to keep out such a foe as now is enterd; yet no purpos'd foe to you whom i could pittie thus forlorne though i unpittied: league with you i seek, and mutual amitie so streight, so close, that i with you must dwell, or you with me henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please like this fair paradise, your sense, yet such accept your makers work; he gave it me, which i as freely give; hell shall unfold, to entertain you two, her widest gates, and send forth all her kings; there will be room, not like these narrow limits, to receive ass your numerous ofspring; if no better place, thank him who puts me loath to this revenge on you who wrong me not for him who wrongd. and should i at your harmless innocence melt, as i doe, yet public reason just, honour and empire with revenge enlarg'd, by conquering this new world, compels me now to do what else though damnd i should abhorre. so spake the fiend, and with necessitie, the tyrants plea, excus'd his devilish deeds. then from his loftie stand on that high tree down he alights among the sportful herd of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one, now other, as thir shape servd best his end neerer to view his prey, and unespi'd to mark what of thir state he more might learn by word or action markt: about them round a lion now he stalkes with fierie glare, then as a tyger, who by chance hath spi'd in some purlieu two gentle fawnes at play, strait couches close, then rising changes oft his couchant watch, as one who chose his ground whence rushing he might surest seize them both grip't in each paw: when adam first of men to first of women eve thus moving speech, turnd him all eare to hear new utterance flow. sole partner and sole part of all these joyes, dearer thy self then all; needs must the power that made us, and for us this ample world be infinitly good, and of his good as liberal and free as infinite, that rais'd us from the dust and plac't us here in all this happiness, who at his hand have nothing merited, nor can performe aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires from us no other service then to keep this one, this easie charge, of all the trees in paradise that bear delicious fruit so various, not to taste that onely tree of knowledge, planted by the tree of life, so neer grows death to life, what ere death is, som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst god hath pronounc't it death to taste that tree, the only sign of our obedience left among so many signes of power and rule conferrd upon us, and dominion giv'n over all other creatures that possess earth, aire, and sea. then let us not think hard one easie prohibition, who enjoy free leave so large to all things else, and choice unlimited of manifold delights: but let us ever praise him, and extoll his bountie, following our delightful task to prune these growing plants, and tend these flours, which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet. to whom thus eve repli'd. o thou for whom and from whom i was formd flesh of thy flesh, and without whom am to no end, my guide and head, what thou hast said is just and right. for wee to him indeed all praises owe, and daily thanks, i chiefly who enjoy so farr the happier lot, enjoying thee praeeminent by so much odds, while thou like consort to thy self canst no where find. that day i oft remember, when from sleep i first awak't, and found my self repos'd under a shade of flours, much wondring where and what i was, whence thither brought, and how. not distant far from thence a murmuring sound of waters issu'd from a cave and spread into a liquid plain, then stood unmov'd pure as th' expanse of heav'n; i thither went with unexperienc't thought, and laid me downe on the green bank, to look into the cleer smooth lake, that to me seemd another skie. as i bent down to look, just opposite, a shape within the watry gleam appeerd bending to look on me, i started back, it started back, but pleas'd i soon returnd, pleas'd it returnd as soon with answering looks of sympathie and love; there i had fixt mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire, had not a voice thus warnd me, what thou seest, what there thou seest fair creature is thy self, with thee it came and goes: but follow me, and i will bring thee where no shadow staies thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare multitudes like thy self, and thence be call'd mother of human race: what could i doe, but follow strait, invisibly thus led? till i espi'd thee, fair indeed and tall, under a platan, yet methought less faire, less winning soft, less amiablie milde, then that smooth watry image; back i turnd, thou following cryd'st aloud, return faire eve, whom fli'st thou? whom thou fli'st, of him thou art, his flesh, his bone; to give thee being i lent out of my side to thee, neerest my heart substantial life, to have thee by my side henceforth an individual solace dear; part of my soul i seek thee, and thee claim my other half: with that thy gentle hand seisd mine, i yielded, and from that time see how beauty is excelld by manly grace and wisdom, which alone is truly fair. so spake our general mother, and with eyes of conjugal attraction unreprov'd, and meek surrender, half imbracing leand on our first father, half her swelling breast naked met his under the flowing gold of her loose tresses hid: he in delight both of her beauty and submissive charms smil'd with superior love, as jupiter on juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds that shed may flowers; and press'd her matron lip with kisses pure: aside the devil turnd for envie, yet with jealous leer maligne ey'd them askance, and to himself thus plaind. sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two imparadis't in one anothers arms the happier eden, shall enjoy thir fill of bliss on bliss, while i to hell am thrust, where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire, among our other torments not the least, still unfulfill'd with pain of longing pines; yet let me not forget what i have gain'd from thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems: one fatal tree there stands of knowledge call'd, forbidden them to taste: knowledge forbidd'n? suspicious, reasonless. why should thir lord envie them that? can it be sin to know, can it be death? and do they onely stand by ignorance, is that thir happie state, the proof of thir obedience and thir faith? o fair foundation laid whereon to build thir ruine! hence i will excite thir minds with more desire to know, and to reject envious commands, invented with designe to keep them low whom knowledge might exalt equal with gods; aspiring to be such, they taste and die: what likelier can ensue? but first with narrow search i must walk round this garden, and no corner leave unspi'd; a chance but chance may lead where i may meet some wandring spirit of heav'n, by fountain side, or in thick shade retir'd, from him to draw what further would be learnt. live while ye may, yet happie pair; enjoy, till i return, short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed. so saying, his proud step he scornful turn'd, but with sly circumspection, and began through wood, through waste, o're hill, o're dale his roam. mean while in utmost longitude, where heav'n with earth and ocean meets, the setting sun slowly descended, and with right aspect against the eastern gate of paradise leveld his eevning rayes: it was a rock of alablaster, pil'd up to the clouds, conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent accessible from earth, one entrance high; the rest was craggie cliff, that overhung still as it rose, impossible to climbe. betwixt these rockie pillars gabriel sat chief of th' angelic guards, awaiting night; about him exercis'd heroic games th' unarmed youth of heav'n, but nigh at hand celestial armourie, shields, helmes, and speares, hung high with diamond flaming, and with gold. thither came uriel, gliding through the eeven on a sun beam, swift as a shooting starr in autumn thwarts the night, when vapors fir'd impress the air, and shews the mariner from what point of his compass to beware impetuous winds: he thus began in haste. gabriel, to thee thy course by lot hath giv'n charge and strict watch that to this happie place no evil thing approach or enter in; this day at highth of noon came to my spheare a spirit, zealous, as he seem'd, to know more of th' almighties works, and chiefly man gods latest image: i describ'd his way bent all on speed, and markt his aerie gate; but in the mount that lies from eden north, where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks alien from heav'n, with passions foul obscur'd: mine eye pursu'd him still, but under shade lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew i fear, hath ventur'd from the deep, to raise new troubles; him thy care must be to find. to whom the winged warriour thus returnd: uriel, no wonder if thy perfet sight, amid the suns bright circle where thou sitst, see farr and wide: in at this gate none pass the vigilance here plac't, but such as come well known from heav'n; and since meridian hour no creature thence: if spirit of other sort, so minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds on purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude spiritual substance with corporeal barr. but if within the circuit of these walks, in whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom thou tellst, by morrow dawning i shall know. so promis'd hee, and uriel to his charge returnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd bore him slope downward to the sun now fall'n beneath th' azores; whither the prime orb, incredible how swift, had thither rowl'd diurnal, or this less volubil earth by shorter flight to th' east, had left him there arraying with reflected purple and gold the clouds that on his western throne attend: now came still eevning on, and twilight gray had in her sober liverie all things clad; silence accompanied, for beast and bird, they to thir grassie couch, these to thir nests were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale; she all night long her amorous descant sung; silence was pleas'd: now glow'd the firmament with living saphirs: hesperus that led the starrie host, rode brightest, till the moon rising in clouded majestie, at length apparent queen unvaild her peerless light, and o're the dark her silver mantle threw. when adam thus to eve: fair consort, th' hour of night, and all things now retir'd to rest mind us of like repose, since god hath set labour and rest, as day and night to men successive, and the timely dew of sleep now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines our eye-lids; other creatures all day long rove idle unimploid, and less need rest; man hath his daily work of body or mind appointed, which declares his dignitie, and the regard of heav'n on all his waies; while other animals unactive range, and of thir doings god takes no account. to morrow ere fresh morning streak the east with first approach of light, we must be ris'n, and at our pleasant labour, to reform yon flourie arbors, yonder allies green, our walk at noon, with branches overgrown, that mock our scant manuring, and require more hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth: those blossoms also, and those dropping gumms, that lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth, ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease; mean while, as nature wills, night bids us rest. to whom thus eve with perfet beauty adornd. my author and disposer, what thou bidst unargu'd i obey; so god ordains, god is thy law, thou mine: to know no more is womans happiest knowledge and her praise. with thee conversing i forget all time, all seasons and thir change, all please alike. sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet, with charm of earliest birds; pleasant the sun when first on this delightful land he spreads his orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour, glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth after soft showers; and sweet the coming on of grateful eevning milde, then silent night with this her solemn bird and this fair moon, and these the gemms of heav'n, her starrie train: but neither breath of morn when she ascends with charm of earliest birds, nor rising sun on this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure, glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers, nor grateful eevning mild, nor silent night with this her solemn bird, nor walk by moon, or glittering starr-light without thee is sweet. but wherfore all night long shine these, for whom this glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes? to whom our general ancestor repli'd. daughter of god and man, accomplisht eve, those have thir course to finish, round the earth, by morrow eevning, and from land to land in order, though to nations yet unborn, ministring light prepar'd, they set and rise; least total darkness should by night regaine her old possession, and extinguish life in nature and all things, which these soft fires not only enlighten, but with kindly heate of various influence foment and warme, temper or nourish, or in part shed down thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow on earth, made hereby apter to receive perfection from the suns more potent ray. these then, though unbeheld in deep of night, shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none, that heav'n would want spectators, god want praise; millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:. all these with ceasless praise his works behold both day and night: how often from the steep of echoing hill or thicket have we heard celestial voices to the midnight air, sole, or responsive each to others note singing thir great creator: oft in bands while they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk with heav'nly touch of instrumental sounds in full harmonic number joind, thir songs divide the night, and lift our thoughts to heaven. thus talking hand in hand alone they pass'd on to thir blissful bower; it was a place chos'n by the sovran planter, when he fram'd all things to mans delightful use; the roofe of thickest covert was inwoven shade laurel and mirtle, and what higher grew of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side acanthus, and each odorous bushie shrub fenc'd up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour, iris all hues, roses, and gessamin rear'd high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought mosaic; underfoot the violet, crocus, and hyacinth with rich inlay broiderd the ground, more colour'd then with stone of costliest emblem: other creature here beast, bird, insect, or worm durst enter none; such was thir awe of man. in shadie bower more sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd, pan or silvanus never slept, nor nymph, nor faunus haunted. here in close recess with flowers, garlands, and sweet-smelling herbs espoused eve deckt first her nuptial bed, and heav'nly quires the hymenaean sung, what day the genial angel to our sire brought her in naked beauty more adorn'd, more lovely then pandora, whom the gods endowd with all thir gifts, and o too like in sad event, when to the unwiser son of japhet brought by hermes, she ensnar'd mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng'd on him who had stole joves authentic fire. thus at thir shadie lodge arriv'd, both stood both turnd, and under op'n skie ador'd the god that made both skie, air, earth and heav'n which they beheld, the moons resplendent globe and starrie pole: thou also mad'st the night, maker omnipotent, and thou the day, which we in our appointed work imployd have finisht happie in our mutual help and mutual love, the crown of all our bliss ordaind by thee, and this delicious place for us too large, where thy abundance wants partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground. but thou hast promis'd from us two a race to fill the earth, who shall with us extoll thy goodness infinite, both when we wake, and when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep. this said unanimous, and other rites observing none, but adoration pure which god likes best, into thir inmost bowre handed they went; and eas'd the putting off these troublesom disguises which wee wear, strait side by side were laid, nor turnd i weene adam from his fair spouse, nor eve the rites mysterious of connubial love refus'd: whatever hypocrites austerely talk of puritie and place and innocence, defaming as impure what god declares pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all. our maker bids increase, who bids abstain but our destroyer, foe to god and man? haile wedded love, mysterious law, true source of human ofspring, sole proprietie, in paradise of all things common else. by thee adulterous lust was driv'n from men among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee founded in reason, loyal, just, and pure, relations dear, and all the charities of father, son, and brother first were known. farr be it, that i should write thee sin or blame, or think thee unbefitting holiest place, perpetual fountain of domestic sweets, whose bed is undefil'd and chaste pronounc't, present, or past, as saints and patriarchs us'd. here love his golden shafts imploies, here lights his constant lamp, and waves his purple wings, reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile of harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard, casual fruition, nor in court amours mixt dance, or wanton mask, or midnight bal, or serenate, which the starv'd lover sings to his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. these lulld by nightingales imbraceing slept, and on thir naked limbs the flourie roof showrd roses, which the morn repair'd. sleep on blest pair; and o yet happiest if ye seek no happier state, and know to know no more. now had night measur'd with her shaddowie cone half way up hill this vast sublunar vault, and from thir ivorie port the cherubim forth issuing at th' accustomd hour stood armd to thir night watches in warlike parade, when gabriel to his next in power thus spake. uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the south with strictest watch; these other wheel the north, our circuit meets full west. as flame they part half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear. from these, two strong and suttle spirits he calld that neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge. ithuriel and zephon, with wingd speed search through this garden, leave unsearcht no nook, but chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge, now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme. this eevning from the sun's decline arriv'd who tells of som infernal spirit seen hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap'd the barrs of hell, on errand bad no doubt: such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. so saying, on he led his radiant files, daz'ling the moon; these to the bower direct in search of whom they sought: him there they found squat like a toad, close at the eare of eve; assaying by his devilish art to reach the organs of her fancie, and with them forge illusions as he list, phantasms and dreams, or if, inspiring venom, he might taint th' animal spirits that from pure blood arise like gentle breaths from rivers pure, thence raise at least distemperd, discontented thoughts, vaine hopes, vaine aimes, inordinate desires blown up with high conceits ingendring pride. him thus intent ithuriel with his spear touch'd lightly; for no falshood can endure touch of celestial temper, but returns of force to its own likeness: up he starts discoverd and surpriz'd. as when a spark lights on a heap of nitrous powder, laid fit for the tun som magazin to store against a rumord warr, the smuttie graine with sudden blaze diffus'd, inflames the aire: so started up in his own shape the fiend. back stept those two faire angels half amaz'd so sudden to behold the grieslie king; yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon. which of those rebell spirits adjudg'd to hell com'st thou, escap'd thy prison, and transform'd, why satst thou like an enemie in waite here watching at the head of these that sleep? know ye not then said satan, fill'd with scorn, know ye not mee? ye knew me once no mate for you, there sitting where ye durst not soare; not to know mee argues your selves unknown, the lowest of your throng; or if ye know, why ask ye, and superfluous begin your message, like to end as much in vain? to whom thus zephon, answering scorn with scorn. think not, revolted spirit, thy shape the same, or undiminisht brightness, to be known as when thou stoodst in heav'n upright and pure; that glorie then, when thou no more wast good, departed from thee, and thou resembl'st now thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule. but come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account to him who sent us, whose charge is to keep this place inviolable, and these from harm. so spake the cherube, and his grave rebuke severe in youthful beautie, added grace invincible: abasht the devil stood, and felt how awful goodness is, and saw vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin'd his loss; but chiefly to find here observd his lustre visibly impar'd; yet seemd undaunted. if i must contend, said he, best with the best, the sender not the sent, or all at once; more glorie will be wonn, or less be lost. thy fear, said zephon bold, will save us trial what the least can doe single against thee wicked, and thence weak. the fiend repli'd not, overcome with rage; but like a proud steed reind, went hautie on, chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie he held it vain; awe from above had quelld his heart, not else dismai'd. now drew they nigh the western point, where those half-rounding guard just met, and closing stood in squadron joind awaiting next command. to whom thir chief gabriel from the front thus calld aloud. o friends, i hear the tread of nimble feet hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne ithuriel and zephon through the shade, and with them comes a third of regal port, but faded splendor wan; who by his gate and fierce demeanour seems the prince of hell, not likely to part hence without contest; stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. he scarce had ended, when those two approachd and brief related whom they brought, where found, how busied, in what form and posture coucht. to whom with stern regard thus gabriel spake. why hast thou, satan broke the bounds prescrib'd to thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge of others, who approve not to transgress by thy example, but have power and right to question thy bold entrance on this place; imploi'd it seems to violate sleep, and those whose dwelling god hath planted here in bliss? to whom thus satan, with contemptuous brow. gabriel, thou hadst in heav'n th' esteem of wise, and such i held thee; but this question askt puts me in doubt. lives ther who loves his pain? who would not, finding way, break loose from hell, though thither doomd? thou wouldst thy self, no doubt, and boldly venture to whatever place farthest from pain, where thou mightest hope to change torment with ease, and soonest recompence dole with delight, which in this place i sought; to thee no reason; who knowst only good, but evil hast not tri'd: and wilt object his will who bound us? let him surer barr his iron gates, if he intends our stay in that dark durance: thus much what was askt. the rest is true, they found me where they say; but that implies not violence or harme. thus he in scorn.the warlike angel mov'd, disdainfully half smiling thus repli'd. o loss of one in heav'n to judge of wise, since satan fell, whom follie overthrew, and now returns him from his prison scap't, gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither unlicenc't from his bounds in hell prescrib'd; so wise he judges it to fly from pain however, and to scape his punishment. so judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth, which thou incurr'st by flying, meet thy flight seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to hell, which taught thee yet no better, that no pain can equal anger infinite provok't. but wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee came not all hell broke loose? is pain to them less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they less hardie to endure? courageous chief, the first in flight from pain, had'st thou alledg'd to thy deserted host this cause of flight, thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. to which the fiend thus answerd frowning stern. not that i less endure, or shrink from pain, insulting angel, well thou knowst i stood thy fiercest, when in battel to thy aide thy blasting volied thunder made all speed and seconded thy else not dreaded spear. but still thy words at random, as before, argue thy inexperience what behooves from hard assaies and ill successes past a faithful leader, not to hazard all through wayes of danger by himself untri'd. i therefore, i alone first undertook to wing the desolate abyss, and spie this new created world, whereof in hell fame is not silent, here in hope to find better abode, and my afflicted powers to settle here on earth, or in mid aire; though for possession put to try once more what thou and thy gay legions dare against; whose easier business were to serve thir lord high up in heav'n, with songs to hymne his throne, and practis'd distances to cringe, not fight. to whom the warriour angel, soon repli'd. to say and strait unsay, pretending first wise to flie pain, professing next the spie, argues no leader but a lyar trac't, satan, and couldst thou faithful add? o name, o sacred name of faithfulness profan'd! faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? armie of fiends, fit body to fit head; was this your discipline and faith ingag'd, your military obedience, to dissolve allegeance to th' acknowldg'd power supream? and thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem patron of liberty, who more then thou once fawn'd, and cring'd, and servilly ador'd heav'ns awful monarch? wherefore but in hope to dispossess him, and thy self to reigne? but mark what i arreede thee now, avant; flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre within these hallowd limits thou appeer, back to th' infernal pit i drag thee chaind, and seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne the facil gates of hell too slightly barrd. so threatn'd hee, but satan to no threats gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli'd. then when i am thy captive talk of chaines, proud limitarie cherube, but ere then farr heavier load thy self expect to feel from my prevailing arme, though heavens king ride on thy wings, and thou with thy compeers, us'd to the yoak, draw'st his triumphant wheels in progress through the rode of heav'n star-pav'd. while thus he spake, th' angelic squadron bright turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes thir phalanx, and began to hemm him round with ported spears, as thick as when a field of ceres ripe for harvest waving bends her bearded grove of ears, which way the wind swayes them; the careful plowman doubting stands least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves prove chaff. on th' other side satan allarm'd collecting all his might dilated stood, like teneriff or atlas unremov'd: his stature reacht the skie, and on his crest sat horror plum'd; nor wanted in his graspe what seemd both spear and shield: now dreadful deeds might have ensu'd, nor onely paradise in this commotion, but the starrie cope of heav'n perhaps, or all the elements at least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne with violence of this conflict, had not soon th' eternal to prevent such horrid fray hung forth in heav'n his golden scales, yet seen betwixt astrea and the scorpion signe, wherein all things created first he weighd, the pendulous round earth with ballanc't aire in counterpoise, now ponders all events, battels and realms: in these he put two weights the sequel each of parting and of fight; the latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam; which gabriel spying, thus bespake the fiend. satan, i know thy strength, and thou knowst mine, neither our own but giv'n; what follie then to boast what arms can doe, since thine no more then heav'n permits, nor mine, though doubld now to trample thee as mire: for proof look up, and read thy lot in yon celestial sign where thou art weigh'd, and shown how light, how weak, if thou resist. the fiend lookt up and knew his mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night. <line>","religion,christianity,god & the divine"

11041,5197,"<line> <line>the clear orange bottle was empty. it had been empty a day.it suddenly seemed so costlyand uncalled for anyway. two years had passed. they had passedmore or less the way years should.maybe he’d changed. or maybethe doctors had misunderstood. it was june. the enormous elm treewas green again, and the scentof hyacinth reached through the windowand followed wherever he went. and the sky was the firmament!his life was never better.each small white spotless cloud that passedwas like a long-wished-for letter. but then he remembered his promise.it came like a mild cramp,and it sat there all day in the back of his mindlike a gas bill awaiting a stamp. he saw three faces that sunday,mother, sister, niece,all with the same kind, brown, scared eyesthat brought him no peace. the sidewalk sparrows were peeping.his whole house smelled like a flower.but he remembered his promise.the drugstore said one hour. back home again, he was tired.the label said caution, said warning.he left the clear orange bottleon the lip of the sink till morning. the insert said warning, said caution.the insert said constipation.it said insomnia, vivid dreams,and hypersalivation, and increased urination, and a spinning sensation. it also said night sweats, andagranulocytosis,and strongly suggested a full glass of waterbe drunk with all doses. the insert said all this,the insert he never read.but he didn’t have to read itto know what it said. the bedroom was calm with moonlightand the breeze through the screen was cooling.through the elm leaves the shivery light on the wallcame like quicksilver pooling.but just before five, something woke him —a close whisper — or maybe a far cry —and the bedroom was queasy with light the colorof lapis lazuli.he lay there listening hardtill six, till seven, till eight ...at nine he remembered the bottle.but nine, nine was too late. “don’t take me!” cried the clozapine.“don’t take me!” cried the pill. by ten he was feeling restless,with a whole day left to kill.“don’t take me!” cried the clozapine.“yes, don’t!” cried the medication. and the bright yellow morning seemed suddenly edgedwith a shady fascination. why should he go to his workplace?who was his supervisor?he had a sickening feelingthat he was becoming wiser.his room filled up with interest.he had begun to think!he thought of the knives in the kitchenand the bottles under the sink.he thought as he switched the stove onor stood at his shaving mirror,or reached for his belt in the wardrobe. thinking made things clearer. even the bedroom window,the open window full of sun,continually hintedat something that should be done.but he was crooked and useless. he was a piece of shit. and so, as everyone knew he would, he failed to go through with it. “don’t take me!” cried the clozapine. “don’t take me!” cried the drug. just then, the telephone rang. just then, he ripped out the plug. “don’t take me!” cried the clozapine. “don’t take me!” cried the poison. and the door of the house creaked open, and the cellar door lilted and murmured, and the garden gate groaned and yawned and let a little noise in. there, just outside his window, lurked life like a cheap cartoon. he shut the sash, locked it, and checked it, and checked it all afternoon. he lowered the blinds on that world, no longer an agent of it, but then, with one finger, pulled down a slat and set his eye above it. at first it was grimly amusing,at last it was grimly grim,to watch all those hunched, hurried people,who made like they weren’t watching him. the neighbors were thinking out loud.they knew he was no fucking good.so he slumped on a stool in the cornerlike a bad little snaggletooth should. they called him a dirty pig, and laughed,and said he shouldn’t exist.sometimes they made a tsking sound,or oinked at him, or hissed. they hissed that he was to blamefor everything, and everyone knew it,and that if he weren’t such a pussyhe’d know what to do, and he’d do it. he lay on his side on the rug unable to move at allexcept for his big right toe, which dug and dug at the wall, which dug at the wall, which dug. “don’t take me!” cried the clozapine.“don’t take me!” cried the cure.and they begged him to sew his mouth shutjust to make goddamn sure. “don’t take me!” cried the clozapine.“don’t take me!” cried the poison.and the gate to the wicked city gaped,and the gates of the temple screamed and screamed,and the gates of the garden groaned and yawned,and the gates of the ziggurat gabbled in grief,and sucked all life’s sorrows and joys in. his thoughts were advancing like wolves.he lay still for an hour and a half,then reared up onto his rickety legslike a newborn calf.then rug hall stairsporch stoop streetand the blacktop humanly warmon the soles of his naked feet.his walk was stiffened by fear, but it took him where he was going,into the terrible world of children and daffodils growing, and friendly people helloing, and the super out doing the mowing, and the two old sisters out in wool sweaters with their wrinkled cheeks pinkly glowing, and the pretty lady who would give birth by christmas barely showing but showing, and the policeman helping to keep the lazy afternoon traffic flowing, and time itself slowing, and none of them, none of them knowingthat an odious axis was forming,that it would not be controlled,that schemes were afoot, that a footwas a thing for a jackboot to hold,that the street was a movie set,that it was not warm and sunny,that a creditor was callingwho could not be paid with money, that the world was like a sliverof iron held in the hand,and his mind the lodestone above itthat made it stir or stand,that the air was slowly changingto a color they didn’t know,that he was a famous doctoron a television show.but what could he do? even friendswould take these facts for lies,and he couldn’t tell who the enemies were,though he felt the hot breath of their eyes,so he kept his big mouth shut and tried to play along,and plowed down the street toward the coffeeshopas if nothing at all were wrong.he tried not to notice the numbers painted on garbage cans.he tried and he tried not to lookat the black unmarked sedans.the coffeeshop smelled like coffee,but it felt different inside.a new waitress went by. she winked. he kept his eyes open wide.everything screamed “run away!”but he wasn’t really there!so he stood by the gumball machinesand smiled and tried not to stare.“the power is yours!” said a t-shirt.“look for lightning!” reported the weather.and the stranger who offered the sports section said,“it’s all there, chief. just put it together.”then wild-eyed out of the kitchenstormed a small, hard old man,shouting in a strange languageand waving a frying pan,shoving him out the doorand into the chattering street,shoving him, waving, shouting, and pointing at his feet, at his bare, gray feet.then came the dark blue uniform,the badge glinting in the sun,and the belt jangling like a storm trooper’sas the boots broke into a run.“take that!” cried the patrolman.“take that!” cried johnny law.street, knee, neck —cuffs, curb, jaw.and the flatfoot pushed him, bleeding, into the sleek cruiser,and he heard all the gawkers thinkingthat he was a pig and a loser,and his chin throbbed,and the handcuffs ate at his wrist,and he would be hacked into pieces soonand would not be missed. “don’t take me!” cried the victim.“don’t take me!” cried the threat.but the angry back of a headwas the only response he could get.lying on his side like a child at the end of a big day,he gazed up through the windowand watched it all slip away.the little pen where they put himhad a toilet but no stall.here and there a messagescarred the gloss-white wall.time passed. but you couldn’t tell iton the trapped fly ticking the ceiling,or the flickering light overhead,or the sore on his chin congealing, or on the sound of the other pigs in the other pens, squealing.when the men came, he was ready.he talked. they took it all down.and soon they were back in the cruiser,on their way across town.then, into the mirrored building,over the waxed lobby floors,down miles of echoing hallways,through the heavy brown doors,into a humming beige roomwith a bed and a river view,and an outside lock, and jailerswho wore white instead of blue.“take that,” smiled the doctor. “take that,” smiled the nurse. he pressed his lips still tighter,and things got worse and worse.“please!” threatened the nurse.“please!” growled the doctor.he raised his fists to cover his mouth,but the nurse was too close, and he clocked her.now into the room came the big men,who did not clamor or shout,but pinned him with ease to the bed,strapped him down, and went out.and the doctor was there again, trailinga spider web of cologne,and the doctor told what would happen next,in an expert monotone,and the nurse took a needleand emptied it into his arm,and they both left, content that he could do no more harm,and he fought, and the straps cut his shoulders, and he gnawed at his lip, and it bled,and he held his bladder for three long hours,then shivered and pissed the bed.when the doctor came a fifth time,it was long past dawn.they’d found him a room, said the doctor,gently restraining a yawn.the next two days were sleep, and words through a fine white mist.then he woke inside a machinewhose motion he couldn’t resist: “tick-tock,” said the clock. “creak, creak,” said the bed. “drip, drip,” said the sink. “throb, throb,” went his head. “ho-hum,” sighed the night nurse. “heh-heh,” said the sicko. “why? why?” screamed the patient. “howl, howl!” cried the psycho. “wolf! wolf!” cried the boy. “gobble, gobble!” sang the freaks. “sa, sa!” cried the king. “tick-tock,” went the weeks. “bang, bang,” said the tv. “teeter-totter,” went his brain. “click, click,” went the checkers. “pitter-patter,” went the rain. “bring-bring,” said the pay phone. “snip, snip,” went fate. “jangle-jingle,” went the keys. “clank-clink,” went the gate. “bye-bye,” said the nurse. “bye-bye,” said the guard. “bar-bar,” said the doctor. “baa-baa,” said the lamb. “my, my,” said his mother. “boohoo!” cried bo peep. “bow-wow,” said the wolf. “baa-baa,” said the sheep.in the car away from that place, the family had a pleasant chat.he seemed fine again, and humble, though his speech was oddly flat.he said that the halfway housewhere he would be residingwas located on a quiet block and hadgreen vinyl siding.there he met new peopleand watched the television,which did not watch him backor speak to him with derision,and he performed certain tasks,meant to teach certain skills,and he got small checks from the governmentto pay his enormous bills.each night he fell asleep, and each morning he got up,and he washed down his medicineand squashed the paper cup, feeling, in all, much better, more in touch with common sense, and also slightly boredby the lack of consequence.and the church bells rangand a dinner bell tinkledand the school bell tolledand called all the good girls and boys in.and all of them brought all their toys in.and all of them swallowed their poison. <line>","living,health & illness,life choices,the

what sin to me unknown dipp'd me in ink, my parents', or my own? as yet a child, nor yet a fool to fame, i lisp'd in numbers, for the numbers came. i left no calling for this idle trade, no duty broke, no father disobey'd. the muse but serv'd to ease some friend, not wife, to help me through this long disease, my life, to second, arbuthnot! thy art and care, and teach the being you preserv'd, to bear. but why then publish? granville the polite, and knowing walsh, would tell me i could write; well-natur'd garth inflamed with early praise, and congreve lov'd, and swift endur'd my lays; the courtly talbot, somers, sheffield read, ev'n mitred rochester would nod the head, and st. john's self (great dryden's friends before) with open arms receiv'd one poet more. happy my studies, when by these approv'd! happier their author, when by these belov'd! from these the world will judge of men and books, not from the burnets, oldmixons, and cookes. soft were my numbers; who could take offence, while pure description held the place of sense? like gentle fanny's was my flow'ry theme, a painted mistress, or a purling stream. yet then did gildon draw his venal quill; i wish'd the man a dinner, and sat still. yet then did dennis rave in furious fret; i never answer'd, i was not in debt. if want provok'd, or madness made them print, i wag'd no war with bedlam or the mint. did some more sober critic come abroad? if wrong, i smil'd; if right, i kiss'd the rod. pains, reading, study, are their just pretence, and all they want is spirit, taste, and sense. commas and points they set exactly right, and 'twere a sin to rob them of their mite. yet ne'er one sprig of laurel grac'd these ribalds, from slashing bentley down to pidling tibbalds. each wight who reads not, and but scans and spells, each word-catcher that lives on syllables, ev'n such small critics some regard may claim, preserv'd in milton's or in shakespeare's name. pretty! in amber to observe the forms of hairs, or straws, or dirt, or grubs, or worms; the things, we know, are neither rich nor rare, but wonder how the devil they got there? were others angry? i excus'd them too; well might they rage; i gave them but their due. a man's true merit 'tis not hard to find, but each man's secret standard in his mind, that casting weight pride adds to emptiness, this, who can gratify? for who can guess? the bard whom pilfer'd pastorals renown, who turns a persian tale for half a crown, just writes to make his barrenness appear, and strains, from hard-bound brains, eight lines a year: he, who still wanting, though he lives on theft, steals much, spends little, yet has nothing left: and he, who now to sense, now nonsense leaning, means not, but blunders round about a meaning: and he, whose fustian's so sublimely bad, it is not poetry, but prose run mad: all these, my modest satire bade translate, and own'd, that nine such poets made a tate. how did they fume, and stamp, and roar, and chafe? and swear, not addison himself was safe. peace to all such! but were there one whose fires true genius kindles, and fair fame inspires, blest with each talent and each art to please, and born to write, converse, and live with ease: should such a man, too fond to rule alone, bear, like the turk, no brother near the throne, view him with scornful, yet with jealous eyes, and hate for arts that caus'd himself to rise; damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer, and without sneering, teach the rest to sneer; willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike, just hint a fault, and hesitate dislike; alike reserv'd to blame, or to commend, a tim'rous foe, and a suspicious friend; dreading ev'n fools, by flatterers besieg'd, and so obliging, that he ne'er oblig'd; like cato, give his little senate laws, and sit attentive to his own applause; while wits and templars ev'ry sentence raise, and wonder with a foolish face of praise. who but must laugh, if such a man there be? who would not weep, if atticus were he? what though my name stood rubric on the walls, or plaister'd posts, with claps, in capitals? or smoking forth, a hundred hawkers' load, on wings of winds came flying all abroad? i sought no homage from the race that write; i kept, like asian monarchs, from their sight: poems i heeded (now berhym'd so long) no more than thou, great george! a birthday song. i ne'er with wits or witlings pass'd my days, to spread about the itch of verse and praise; nor like a puppy, daggled through the town, to fetch and carry sing-song up and down; nor at rehearsals sweat, and mouth'd, and cried, with handkerchief and orange at my side; but sick of fops, and poetry, and prate, to bufo left the whole castalian state. proud as apollo on his forked hill, sat full-blown bufo, puff'd by every quill; fed with soft dedication all day long, horace and he went hand in hand in song. his library (where busts of poets dead and a true pindar stood without a head,) receiv'd of wits an undistinguish'd race, who first his judgment ask'd, and then a place: much they extoll'd his pictures, much his seat, and flatter'd ev'ry day, and some days eat: till grown more frugal in his riper days, he paid some bards with port, and some with praise, to some a dry rehearsal was assign'd, and others (harder still) he paid in kind. dryden alone (what wonder?) came not nigh, dryden alone escap'd this judging eye: but still the great have kindness in reserve, he help'd to bury whom he help'd to starve. may some choice patron bless each grey goose quill! may ev'ry bavius have his bufo still! so, when a statesman wants a day's defence, or envy holds a whole week's war with sense, or simple pride for flatt'ry makes demands, may dunce by dunce be whistled off my hands! blest be the great! for those they take away, and those they left me—for they left me gay; left me to see neglected genius bloom, neglected die! and tell it on his tomb; of all thy blameless life the sole return my verse, and queensb'ry weeping o'er thy urn! oh let me live my own! and die so too! (""to live and die is all i have to do:"") maintain a poet's dignity and ease, and see what friends, and read what books i please. above a patron, though i condescend sometimes to call a minister my friend: i was not born for courts or great affairs; i pay my debts, believe, and say my pray'rs; can sleep without a poem in my head, nor know, if dennis be alive or dead. why am i ask'd what next shall see the light? heav'ns! was i born for nothing but to write? has life no joys for me? or (to be grave) have i no friend to serve, no soul to save? ""i found him close with swift""—""indeed? no doubt"", (cries prating balbus) ""something will come out"". 'tis all in vain, deny it as i will. ""no, such a genius never can lie still,"" and then for mine obligingly mistakes the first lampoon sir will. or bubo makes. poor guiltless i! and can i choose but smile, when ev'ry coxcomb knows me by my style? curs'd be the verse, how well soe'er it flow, that tends to make one worthy man my foe, give virtue scandal, innocence a fear, or from the soft-ey'd virgin steal a tear! but he, who hurts a harmless neighbour's peace, insults fall'n worth, or beauty in distress, who loves a lie, lame slander helps about, who writes a libel, or who copies out: that fop, whose pride affects a patron's name, yet absent, wounds an author's honest fame; who can your merit selfishly approve, and show the sense of it without the love; who has the vanity to call you friend, yet wants the honour, injur'd, to defend; who tells what'er you think, whate'er you say, and, if he lie not, must at least betray: who to the dean, and silver bell can swear, and sees at cannons what was never there; who reads, but with a lust to misapply, make satire a lampoon, and fiction, lie. a lash like mine no honest man shall dread, but all such babbling blockheads in his stead. let sporus tremble—""what? that thing of silk, sporus, that mere white curd of ass's milk? satire or sense, alas! can sporus feel? who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?"" yet let me flap this bug with gilded wings, this painted child of dirt that stinks and stings; whose buzz the witty and the fair annoys, yet wit ne'er tastes, and beauty ne'r enjoys, so well-bred spaniels civilly delight in mumbling of the game they dare not bite. eternal smiles his emptiness betray, as shallow streams run dimpling all the way. whether in florid impotence he speaks, and, as the prompter breathes, the puppet squeaks; or at the ear of eve, familiar toad, half froth, half venom, spits himself abroad, in puns, or politics, or tales, or lies, or spite, or smut, or rhymes, or blasphemies. his wit all see-saw, between that and this , now high, now low, now master up, now miss, and he himself one vile antithesis. amphibious thing! that acting either part, the trifling head, or the corrupted heart, fop at the toilet, flatt'rer at the board, now trips a lady, and now struts a lord. eve's tempter thus the rabbins have express'd, a cherub's face, a reptile all the rest; beauty that shocks you, parts that none will trust, wit that can creep, and pride that licks the dust. not fortune's worshipper, nor fashion's fool, not lucre's madman, nor ambition's tool, not proud, nor servile, be one poet's praise, that, if he pleas'd, he pleas'd by manly ways; that flatt'ry, even to kings, he held a shame, and thought a lie in verse or prose the same: that not in fancy's maze he wander'd long, but stoop'd to truth, and moraliz'd his song: that not for fame, but virtue's better end, he stood the furious foe, the timid friend, the damning critic, half-approving wit, the coxcomb hit, or fearing to be hit; laugh'd at the loss of friends he never had, the dull, the proud, the wicked, and the mad; the distant threats of vengeance on his head, the blow unfelt, the tear he never shed; the tale reviv'd, the lie so oft o'erthrown; th' imputed trash, and dulness not his own; the morals blacken'd when the writings 'scape; the libell'd person, and the pictur'd shape; abuse, on all he lov'd, or lov'd him, spread, a friend in exile, or a father, dead; the whisper, that to greatness still too near, perhaps, yet vibrates on his sovereign's ear:— welcome for thee, fair virtue! all the past: for thee, fair virtue! welcome ev'n the last!

frets doubt the maw-crammed beast? rejoice we are allied to that which doth provide and not partake, effect and not receive! a spark disturbs our clod; nearer we hold of god who gives, than of his tribes that take, i must believe. then, welcome each rebuff that turns earth's smoothness rough, each sting that bids nor sit nor stand but go! be our joys three-parts pain! strive, and hold cheap the strain; learn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe! for thence,—a paradox which comforts while it mocks,— shall life succeed in that it seems to fail: what i aspired to be, and was not, comforts me: a brute i might have been, but would not sink i' the scale. what is he but a brute whose flesh has soul to suit, whose spirit works lest arms and legs want play? to man, propose this test— thy body at its best, how far can that project thy soul on its lone way? yet gifts should prove their use: i own the past profuse of power each side, perfection every turn: eyes, ears took in their dole, brain treasured up the whole; should not the heart beat once ""how good to live and learn?"" not once beat ""praise be thine! i see the whole design, i, who saw power, see now love perfect too: perfect i call thy plan: thanks that i was a man! maker, remake, complete,—i trust what thou shalt do!"" for pleasant is this flesh; our soul, in its rose-mesh pulled ever to the earth, still yearns for rest; would we some prize might hold to match those manifold possessions of the brute,—gain most, as we did best! let us not always say, ""spite of this flesh to-day i strove, made head, gained ground upon the whole!"" as the bird wings and sings, let us cry ""all good things are ours, nor soul helps flesh more, now, than flesh helps soul!"" therefore i summon age to grant youth's heritage, life's struggle having so far reached its term: thence shall i pass, approved a man, for aye removed from the developed brute; a god though in the germ. and i shall thereupon take rest, ere i be gone once more on my adventure brave and new: fearless and unperplexed, when i wage battle next, what weapons to select, what armour to indue. youth ended, i shall try my gain or loss thereby; leave the fire ashes, what survives is gold: and i shall weigh the same, give life its praise or blame: young, all lay in dispute; i shall know, being old. for note, when evening shuts, a certain moment cuts the deed off, calls the glory from the grey: a whisper from the west shoots—""add this to the rest, take it and try its worth: here dies another day."" so, still within this life, though lifted o'er its strife, let me discern, compare, pronounce at last, this rage was right i' the main, that acquiescence vain: the future i may face now i have proved the past."" for more is not reserved to man, with soul just nerved to act to-morrow what he learns to-day: here, work enough to watch the master work, and catch hints of the proper craft, tricks of the tool's true play. as it was better, youth should strive, through acts uncouth, toward making, than repose on aught found made: so, better, age, exempt from strife, should know, than tempt further. thou waitedst age: wait death nor be afraid! enough now, if the right and good and infinite be named here, as thou callest thy hand thine own with knowledge absolute, subject to no dispute from fools that crowded youth, nor let thee feel alone. be there, for once and all, severed great minds from small, announced to each his station in the past! was i, the world arraigned, were they, my soul disdained, right? let age speak the truth and give us peace at last! now, who shall arbitrate? ten men love what i hate, shun what i follow, slight what i receive; ten, who in ears and eyes match me: we all surmise, they this thing, and i that: whom shall my soul believe? not on the vulgar mass called ""work,"" must sentence pass, things done, that took the eye and had the price; o'er which, from level stand, the low world laid its hand, found straightway to its mind, could value in a trice: but all, the world's coarse thumb and finger failed to plumb, so passed in making up the main account; all instincts immature, all purposes unsure, that weighed not as his work, yet swelled the man's amount: thoughts hardly to be packed into a narrow act, fancies that broke through language and escaped; all i could never be, all, men ignored in me, this, i was worth to god, whose wheel the pitcher shaped. ay, note that potter's wheel, that metaphor! and feel why time spins fast, why passive lies our clay,— thou, to whom fools propound, when the wine makes its round, ""since life fleets, all is change; the past gone, seize to-day!"" fool! all that is, at all, lasts ever, past recall; earth changes, but thy soul and god stand sure: what entered into thee, that was, is, and shall be: time's wheel runs back or stops: potter and clay endure. he fixed thee mid this dance of plastic circumstance, this present, thou, forsooth, wouldst fain arrest: machinery just meant to give thy soul its bent, try thee and turn thee forth, sufficiently impressed. what though the earlier grooves, which ran the laughing loves around thy base, no longer pause and press? what though, about thy rim, skull-things in order grim grow out, in graver mood, obey the sterner stress? look not thou down but up! to uses of a cup, the festal board, lamp's flash and trumpet's peal, the new wine's foaming flow, the master's lips a-glow! thou, heaven's consummate cup, what need'st thou with earth's wheel? but i need, now as then, thee, god, who mouldest men; and since, not even while the whirl was worst, did i,—to the wheel of life with shapes and colours rife, bound dizzily,—mistake my end, to slake thy thirst: so, take and use thy work: amend what flaws may lurk, what strain o' the stuff, what warpings past the aim! my times be in thy hand! perfect the cup as planned! let age approve of youth, and death complete the same! <line>","living,growing old,time & brevity,religion,judaism,philosophy,engagement,weddings"

john swore to kill any man <line> <line>who touched her, <line> <line>because lo and behold, he owns up to her. <line> <line>he’s proud of her. nobody can believe it. <line> <line>he’s even at her baptism. <line> <line>he buys her cheap dresses and candy at the store. <line> <line>he hands it to her out the door, <line> <line>because she can’t go in. <line> <line>he won’t, he won’t stop looking

itself,” said the preacher <line> <line>the sunday cut clean through by the truth, <line> <line>by the living proof, as old john stood up in church <line> <line>and testified to the power of god, <line> <line>who spoke to him that morning, <line> <line>telling him he was a sinner. <line> <line>he died that winter. horrible suffering, they say. <line> <line>he had a stroke on the way to town. <line> <line>his car ran off the road and he drowned. <line> <line>they say bertha found him. <line> <line>they say she ran all the way to town for the doctor, <line> <line>who told her, “i am not a colored doctor,” <line> <line>so she went and got the sheriff. <line> <line>he listened for a while, then he locked her in a cell. <line> <line>he said he knew she was guilty of something. <line> <line>well, after a while, rose went down there <line> <line>and i swear she nearly had a fit. <line> <line>“get my daughter out here,” she said. <line> <line>“how can you lock up your own brother’s child?” <line> <line>the sheriff knew it was true, so finally he said, <line> <line>“you take her and don’t ever cross my path again.” <line> <line>when bertha passed him on the way out, <line> <line>he tripped her with his foot. <line> <line>when she got off the floor, she said, <line> <line>“every dog has its day.” <line> <line>from that time to this is a straight line, <line> <line>pointing at a girl, <line> <line>who doesn’t even have shoes anymore, <line> <line>as she runs down the road, <line> <line>throwing off her ragged clothes, as she goes, <line> <line>until she’s as naked as the day she was born. <line> <line>when she comes to washing hanging on the line, <line> <line>she grabs a fine dress and keeps on running. <line> <line>she’s crying and laughing at the same time. <line> <line>along comes a truck that says j. goody on the side. <line> <line>the man driving stops to give her a ride. <line> <line>he swings the door open on the passenger side, <line> <line>but bertha says, “move over, i’ll drive.” <line> <line>when she asks him why he stopped, <line> <line>he says, “i know white trash, when i see it. <line> <line>you’re just like me, but you're a girl. you’re pretty. <line> <line>you can free yourself. all you have to do <line> <line>is show a little leg and some titty in the big city.” <line> <line>he gave her fifty cents and a wink <line> <line>and she started thinking she might as well turn white. <line> <line>she got a job waiting table in a dance hall. <line> <line>one night, the boss heard her <line> <line>singing along with the band. <line> <line>he said, “why don’t you go up on stage,” <line> <line>and she said, “i play piano too.” <line> <line>he said, “howdy do.” <line> <line>from then on, she made everybody pay <line> <line>one way, or another. <line> <line>she got hard. she took lovers— <line> <line>fathers, sons, and husbands. <line> <line>it didn't matter, <line> <line>but once in a while, she heard her mother’s voice, <line> <line>saying, “you made the wrong choice,” <line> <line>and she felt the blues <line> <line>and she let loose with a shout. <line> <line>“lordy,” said the boss, “you sound colored.” <line> <line>more and more people came to hear her sing, <line> <line>but they kind of feared her too. <line> <line>they said, she was too white to sing the blues like that. <line> <line>it wasn’t right. <line> <line>one night, she got to talking with the boss. <line> <line>he walked round and round the office, shaking his head, <line> <line>saying how much he’d lose, <line> <line>if she stopped singing the blues. <line> <line>“how often can you find a treasure like mine,” he said, <line> <line>laying his hand on her shoulder, <line> <line>then he said, “if i weren’t so old,” <line> <line>and his voice dropped off to a whisper, <line> <line>then he said, “i got the answer now, sweet roberta. <line> <line>go on down to the dressing room and wait.” <line> <line>it didn't take long. <line> <line>he came in and set a jar on the table. <line> <line>“what do i do with this?” asked bertha. <line> <line>he said, “you’re going to pass for colored.” <line> <line>suddenly, she was wearing blackface. <line> <line>suddenly, she was safe on the other side <line> <line>of the door she slammed on the past <line> <line>and it was standing open at last. <line> <line>she could come and go as she pleased <line> <line>and no one saw her enter, or leave. <line> <line>she was free, she was freed, <line> <line>but she didn’t feel it <line> <line>and she needed it to be real. <line> <line>she went on, though. she flowed like a river, <line> <line>carrying the body of a man, <line> <line>who had himself a nigger, because he could. <line> <line>she lived. she got old. <line> <line>she almost froze one cold spell <line> <line>and she got up from her sickbed <line> <line>and told her daughter <line> <line>she got during the change of life <line> <line>it was time to go. <line> <line>she sewed a note to her ragged coat. <line> <line>it said, “this is the granddaughter of mama rose.” <line> <line>she put fifty cents in her hand <line> <line>and went to stand with her at the bus stop. <line> <line>she would not return, but her child <line> <line>had earned the right to go home. <line> <line>when i got off the bus, <line> <line>a hush fell over the people waiting

(should ripley venture, all the world would smile) but those who cannot write, and those who can, all rhyme, and scrawl, and scribble, to a man. yet, sir, reflect, the mischief is not great; these madmen never hurt the church or state: sometimes the folly benefits mankind; and rarely av'rice taints the tuneful mind. allow him but his plaything of a pen, he ne'er rebels, or plots, like other men: flight of cashiers, or mobs, he'll never mind; and knows no losses while the muse is kind. to cheat a friend, or ward, he leaves to peter; the good man heaps up nothing but mere metre, enjoys his garden and his book in quiet; and then—a perfect hermit in his diet. of little use the man you may suppose, who says in verse what others say in prose: yet let me show, a poet's of some weight, and (though no soldier) useful to the state. what will a child learn sooner than a song? what better teach a foreigner the tongue? what's long or short, each accent where to place, and speak in public with some sort of grace. i scarce can think him such a worthless thing, unless he praise some monster of a king; or virtue or religion turn to sport, to please a lewd, or unbelieving court. unhappy dryden!—in all charles's days, roscommon only boasts unspotted bays; and in our own (excuse some courtly stains) no whiter page than addison remains. he, from the taste obscene reclaims our youth, and sets the passions on the side of truth, forms the soft bosom with the gentlest art, and pours each human virtue in the heart. let ireland tell, how wit upheld her cause, her trade supported, and supplied her laws; and leave on swift this grateful verse engrav'd, ""the rights a court attack'd, a poet sav'd."" behold the hand that wrought a nation's cure, stretch'd to relieve the idiot and the poor, proud vice to brand, or injur'd worth adorn, and stretch the ray to ages yet unborn. not but there are, who merit other palms; hopkins and sternhold glad the heart with psalms: the boys and girls whom charity maintains, implore your help in these pathetic strains: how could devotion touch the country pews, unless the gods bestow'd a proper muse? verse cheers their leisure, verse assists their work, verse prays for peace, or sings down pope and turk. the silenc'd preacher yields to potent strain, and feels that grace his pray'r besought in vain; the blessing thrills through all the lab'ring throng, and heav'n is won by violence of song. our rural ancestors, with little blest, patient of labour when the end was rest, indulg'd the day that hous'd their annual grain, with feasts, and off'rings, and a thankful strain: the joy their wives, their sons, and servants share, ease of their toil, and part'ners of their care: the laugh, the jest, attendants on the bowl, smooth'd ev'ry brow, and open'd ev'ry soul: with growing years the pleasing licence grew, and taunts alternate innocently flew. but times corrupt, and nature, ill-inclin'd, produc'd the point that left a sting behind; till friend with friend, and families at strife, triumphant malice rag'd through private life. who felt the wrong, or fear'd it, took th' alarm, appeal'd to law, and justice lent her arm. at length, by wholesome dread of statutes bound, the poets learn'd to please, and not to wound: most warp'd to flatt'ry's side; but some, more nice, preserv'd the freedom, and forbore the vice. hence satire rose, that just the medium hit, and heals with morals what it hurts with wit. we conquer'd france, but felt our captive's charms; her arts victorious triumph'd o'er our arms; britain to soft refinements less a foe, wit grew polite, and numbers learn'd to flow. waller was smooth; but dryden taught to join the varying verse, the full-resounding line, the long majestic march, and energy divine. though still some traces of our rustic vein and splayfoot verse remain'd, and will remain. late, very late, correctness grew our care, when the tir'd nation breath'd from civil war. exact racine, and corneille's noble fire show'd us that france had something to admire. not but the tragic spirit was our own, and full in shakespeare, fair in otway shone: but otway fail'd to polish or refine, and fluent shakespeare scarce effac'd a line. ev'n copious dryden wanted, or forgot, the last and greatest art, the art to blot. some doubt, if equal pains, or equal fire the humbler muse of comedy require. but in known images of life, i guess the labour greater, as th' indulgence less. observe how seldom ev'n the best succeed: tell me if congreve's fools are fools indeed? what pert, low dialogue has farqu'ar writ! how van wants grace, who never wanted wit! the stage how loosely does astr{ae}ea tread, who fairly puts all characters to bed! and idle cibber, how he breaks the laws, to make poor pinky eat with vast applause! but fill their purse, our poet's work is done, alike to them, by pathos or by pun. o you! whom vanity's light bark conveys on fame's mad voyage by the wind of praise, with what a shifting gale your course you ply, for ever sunk too low, or borne too high! who pants for glory finds but short repose, a breath revives him, or a breath o'erthrows. farewell the stage! if just as thrives the play, the silly bard grows fat, or falls away. there still remains, to mortify a wit, the many-headed monster of the pit: a senseless, worthless, and unhonour'd crowd; who, to disturb their betters mighty proud, clatt'ring their sticks before ten lines are spoke, call for the farce, the bear, or the black-joke. what dear delight to britons farce affords! farce once the taste of mobs, but now of lords; (for taste, eternal wanderer, now flies from heads to ears, and now from ears to eyes.) the play stands still; damn action and discourse, back fly the scenes, and enter foot and horse; pageants on pageants, in long order drawn, peers, heralds, bishops, ermine, gold, and lawn; the champion too! and, to complete the jest, old edward's armour beams on cibber's breast. with laughter sure democritus had died, had he beheld an audience gape so wide. let bear or elephant be e'er so white, the people, sure, the people are the sight! ah luckless poet! stretch thy lungs and roar, that bear or elephant shall heed thee more; while all its throats the gallery extends, and all the thunder of the pit ascends! loud as the wolves on orcas' stormy steep, howl to the roarings of the northern deep. such is the shout, the long-applauding note, at quin's high plume, or oldfield's petticoat, or when from court a birthday suit bestow'd sinks the lost actor in the tawdry load. booth enters—hark! the universal peal! ""but has he spoken?"" not a syllable. ""what shook the stage, and made the people stare?"" cato's long wig, flow'r'd gown, and lacquer'd chair. yet lest you think i rally more than teach, or praise malignly arts i cannot reach, let me for once presume t'instruct the times, to know the poet from the man of rhymes: 'tis he, who gives my breast a thousand pains, can make me feel each passion that he feigns; enrage, compose, with more than magic art, with pity and with terror tear my heart; and snatch me o'er the earth or thro' the air, to thebes, to athens, when he will, and where. but not this part of the poetic state alone, deserves the favour of the great: think of those authors, sir, who would rely more on a reader's sense, than gazer's eye. or who shall wander where the muses sing? who climb their mountain, or who taste their spring? how shall we fill a library with wit, when merlin's cave is half unfurnish'd yet? my liege! why writers little claim your thought, i guess: and, with their leave, will tell the fault: we poets are (upon a poet's word) of all mankind, the creatures most absurd: the season, when to come, and when to go, to sing, or cease to sing, we never know; and if we will recite nine hours in ten, you lose your patience, just like other men. then too we hurt ourselves, when to defend a single verse, we quarrel with a friend; repeat unask'd; lament, the wit's too fine for vulgar eyes, and point out ev'ry line. but most, when straining with too weak a wing, we needs will write epistles to the king; and from the moment we oblige the town, expect a place, or pension from the crown; or dubb'd historians by express command, t'enroll your triumphs o'er the seas and land, be call'd to court to plan some work divine, as once for louis, boileau and racine. yet think, great sir! (so many virtues shown) ah think, what poet best may make them known? or choose at least some minister of grace, fit to bestow the laureate's weighty place. charles, to late times to be transmitted fair, assign'd his figure to bernini's care; and great nassau to kneller's hand decreed to fix him graceful on the bounding steed; so well in paint and stone they judg'd of merit: but kings in wit may want discerning spirit. the hero william, and the martyr charles, one knighted blackmore, and one pension'd quarles; which made old ben, and surly dennis swear, ""no lord's anointed, but a russian bear."" not with such majesty, such bold relief, the forms august, of king, or conqu'ring chief, e'er swell'd on marble; as in verse have shin'd (in polish'd verse) the manners and the mind. oh! could i mount on the m{ae}onian wing, your arms, your actions, your repose to sing! what seas you travers'd! and what fields you fought! your country's peace, how oft, how dearly bought! how barb'rous rage subsided at your word, and nations wonder'd while they dropp'd the sword! how, when you nodded, o'er the land and deep, peace stole her wing, and wrapp'd the world in sleep; till earth's extremes your mediation own, and asia's tyrants tremble at your throne— but verse, alas! your majesty disdains; and i'm not us'd to panegyric strains: the zeal of fools offends at any time, but most of all, the zeal of fools in rhyme, besides, a fate attends on all i write, that when i aim at praise, they say i bite. a vile encomium doubly ridicules: there's nothing blackens like the ink of fools; if true, a woeful likeness; and if lies, ""praise undeserv'd is scandal in disguise."" well may he blush, who gives it, or receives; and when i flatter, let my dirty leaves (like journals, odes, and such forgotten things as eusden, philips, settle, writ of kings) clothe spice, line trunks, or flutt'ring in a row, befringe the rails of bedlam and soho. <line>","arts & sciences,humor & satire,social commentaries,history & politics"

(letter g, old court, south attics), i shut up my mathematics, that confounded hydrostatics— sink it in the deepest sea! in the grate the flickering embers served to show how dull november’s fogs had stamped my torpid members, like a plucked and skinny goose. and as i prepared for bed, i asked myself with voice unsteady, if of all the stuff i read, i ever made the slightest use. late to bed and early rising, ever luxury despising, ever training, never “sizing,” i have suffered with the rest. yellow cheek and forehead ruddy, memory confused and muddy, these are the effects of study of a subject so unblest. look beyond, and see the wrangler, now become a college dangler, court some spiritual angler, nibbling at his golden bait. hear him silence restive reason, her advice is out of season, while her lord is plotting treason gainst himself, and church or state. see him next with place and pension, and the very best intention of upholding that convention under which his fortunes rose. every scruple is rejected, with his cherished schemes connected, “higher powers may be neglected— his result no further goes.” much he lauds the education which has raised to lofty station, men, whose powers of calculation calculation’s self defied. how the learned fool would wonder were he now to see his blunder, when he put his reason under the control of worldly pride. thus i muttered, very seedy, husky was my throat, and reedy; and no wonder, for indeed i now had caught a dreadful cold. thickest fog had settled slowly round the candle, burning lowly, round the fire, where melancholy traced retreating hills of gold. still those papers lay before me— problems made express to bore me, when a silent change came o’er me, in my hard uneasy chair. fire and fog, and candle faded, spectral forms the room invaded, little creatures, that paraded on the problems lying there. fathers there, of every college, led the glorious ranks of knowledge, men, whose virtues all acknowledge levied the proctorial fines; there the modest moderators, set apart as arbitrators ’twixt contending calculators, scrutinised the trembling lines. all the costly apparatus, that is meant to elevate us to the intellectual status necessary for degrees— college tutors—private coaches— line the senate-house approaches. if our alma mater dote, she’s taken care of well by these. much i doubted if the vision were the simple repetition of the statements of commission, strangely jumbled, oddly placed. when an awful form ascended, and with cruel words defended those abuses that offended my unsanctioned private taste. angular in form and feature, unlike any earthly creature, she had properties to meet your eye whatever you might view. hair of pens and skin of paper; breath, not breath but chemic vapour; dress,—such dress as college draper fashions with precision due. eyes of glass, with optic axes twisting rays of light as flax is twisted, while the parallax is made to show the real size. primary and secondary focal lines in planes contrary, sum up all that’s known to vary in those dull, unmeaning eyes. such the eyes, through which all nature seems reduced to meaner stature. if you had them you would hate your symbolising sense of sight. seeing planets in their courses thick beset with arrowy “forces,” while the common eye no more sees than their mild and quiet light. “son,” she said (what could be queerer than thus tête-a -tête to hear her talk, in tones approaching nearer to a saw’s than aught beside? for the voice the spectre spoke in might be known by many a token to proceed from metal, broken when acoustic tricks were tried. little pleased to hear the siren “own” me thus with voice of iron, i had thoughts of just retiring from a mother such a fright). “no,” she said, “the time is pressing, so before i give my blessing, i’ll excuse you from confessing what you thought of me to-night. “powers!” she cried, with hoarse devotion, “give my son the clearest notion how to compass sure promotion, and take care of number one. let his college course be pleasant, let him ever, as at present, seem to have read what he hasn’t, and to do what can’t be done. of the philosophic spirit richly may my son inherit; as for poetry, inter it with the myths of other days. cut the thing entirely, lest yon college don should put the question, why not stick to what you’re best on? mathematics always pays.” as the hag was thus proceeding to prescribe my course of reading, and as i was faintly pleading, hardly knowing what to say, suddenly, my head inclining i beheld a light form shining; and the withered beldam, whining, saw the same and slunk away. then the vision, growing brighter, seemed to make my garret lighter; as when noisome fogs of night are scattered by the rising sun. nearer still it grew and nearer, till my straining eyes caught clearer glimpses of a being dearer, dearer still than number one. in that well-remembered vision i was led to the decision still to hold in calm derision pedantry, however draped; since that artificial spectre proved a paltry sub-collector, and had nothing to connect her with the being whom she aped. i could never finish telling you of her that has her dwelling where those springs of truth are welling, whence all streams of beauty run. she has taught me that creation bears the test of calculation, but that man forgets his station if he stops when that is done. is our algebra the measure of that unexhausted treasure that affords the purest pleasure, ever found when it is sought? let us rather, realising the conclusions thence arising nature more than symbols prizing, learn to worship as we ought. worship? yes, what worship better than when free’d from every fetter that the uninforming letter rivets on the tortured mind, man, with silent admiration sees the glories of creation, and, in holy contemplation, leaves the learned crowd behind! <line>","activities,school & learning,nature,arts & sciences,philosophy,sciences"

11422,7248,"<line> <line>ah whither, love, wilt thou now carry me? <line>what wontless fury dost thou now inspire <line>into my feeble breast, too full of thee? <line>whilst seeking to aslake thy raging fire, <line>thou in me kindlest much more great desire, <line>and up aloft above my strength dost raise <line>the wondrous matter of my fire to praise. <line>that as i erst in praise of thine own name, <line>so now in honour of thy mother dear, <line>an honourable hymn i eke should frame, <line>and with the brightness of her beauty clear, <line>the ravish'd hearts of gazeful men might rear <line>to admiration of that heavenly light, <line>from whence proceeds such soul-enchanting might. <line>thereto do thou, great goddess, queen of beauty, <line>mother of love, and of all world's delight, <line>without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty <line>nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sight, <line>do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light <line>t' illuminate my dim and dulled eyne, <line>and beautify this sacred hymn of thine: <line>that both to thee, to whom i mean it most, <line>and eke to her, whose fair immortal beam <line>hath darted fire into my feeble ghost, <line>that now it wasted is with woes extreme, <line>it may so please, that she at length will stream <line>some dew of grace into my withered heart, <line>after long sorrow and consuming smart. <line>what time this world's great workmaster did cast <line>to make all things such as we now behold, <line>it seems that he before his eyes had plac'd <line>a goodly pattern, to whose perfect mould <line>he fashion'd them as comely as he could; <line>that now so fair and seemly they appear, <line>as nought may be amended anywhere. <line>that wondrous pattern, wheresoe'er it be, <line>whether in earth laid up in secret store, <line>or else in heaven, that no man may it see <line>with sinful eyes, for fear it to deflore, <line>is perfect beauty, which all men adore; <line>whose face and feature doth so much excel <line>all mortal sense, that none the same may tell. <line>thereof as every earthly thing partakes <line>or more or less, by influence divine, <line>so it more fair accordingly it makes, <line>and the gross matter of this earthly mine, <line>which clotheth it, thereafter doth refine, <line>doing away the dross which dims the light <line>of that fair beam which therein is empight. <line>for, through infusion of celestial power, <line>the duller earth it quick'neth with delight, <line>and lifeful spirits privily doth pour <line>through all the parts, that to the looker's sight <line>they seem to please. that is thy sovereign might, <line>o cyprian queen, which flowing from the beam <line>of thy bright star, thou into them dost stream. <line>that is the thing which giveth pleasant grace <line>to all things fair, that kindleth lively fire, <line>light of thy lamp, which, shining in the face, <line>thence to the soul darts amorous desire, <line>and robs the hearts of those which it admire; <line>therewith thou pointest thy son's poison'd arrow, <line>that wounds the life, and wastes the inmost marrow. <line>how vainly then do idle wits invent, <line>that beauty is nought else but mixture made <line>of colours fair, and goodly temp'rament <line>of pure complexions, that shall quickly fade <line>and pass away, like to a summer's shade; <line>or that it is but comely composition <line>of parts well measur'd, with meet disposition. <line>hath white and red in it such wondrous power, <line>that it can pierce through th' eyes unto the heart, <line>and therein stir such rage and restless stour, <line>as nought but death can stint his dolour's smart? <line>or can proportion of the outward part <line>move such affection in the inward mind, <line>that it can rob both sense and reason blind? <line>why do not then the blossoms of the field, <line>which are array'd with much more orient hue, <line>and to the sense most dainty odours yield, <line>work like impression in the looker's view? <line>or why do not fair pictures like power shew, <line>in which oft-times we nature see of art <line>excell'd, in perfect limning every part? <line>but ah, believe me, there is more than so, <line>that works such wonders in the minds of men; <line>i, that have often prov'd, too well it know, <line>and whoso list the like assays to ken, <line>shall find by trial, and confess it then, <line>that beauty is not, as fond men misdeem, <line>an outward shew of things, that only seem. <line>for that same goodly hue of white and red, <line>with which the cheeks are sprinkled, shall decay, <line>and those sweet rosy leaves, so fairly spread <line>upon the lips, shall fade and fall away <line>to that they were, even to corrupted clay; <line>that golden wire, those sparkling stars so bright, <line>shall turn to dust; and lose their goodly light. <line>but that fair lamp, from whose celestial ray <line>that light proceeds, which kindleth lovers' fire, <line>shall never be extinguish'd nor decay; <line>but when the vital spirits do expire, <line>unto her native planet shall retire; <line>for it is heavenly born and cannot die, <line>being a parcel of the purest sky. <line>for when the soul, the which derived was, <line>at first, out of that great immortal spright, <line>by whom all live to love, whilom did pass <line>down from the top of purest heaven's height <line>to be embodied here, it then took light <line>and lively spirits from that fairest star, <line>which lights the world forth from his fiery car. <line>which power retaining still or more or less, <line>when she in fleshly seed is eft enraced, <line>through every part she doth the same impress, <line>according as the heavens have her graced, <line>and frames her house, in which she will be placed, <line>fit for herself, adorning it with spoil <line>of th' heavenly riches which she robb'd erewhile. <line>thereof it comes that these fair souls, which have <line>the most resemblance of that heavenly light, <line>frame to themselves most beautiful and brave <line>their fleshly bower, most fit for their delight, <line>and the gross matter by a sovereign might <line>tempers so trim, that it may well be seen <line>a palace fit for such a virgin queen. <line>so every spirit, as it is most pure, <line>and hath in it the more of heavenly light, <line>so it the fairer body doth procure <line>to habit in, and it more fairly dight <line>with cheerful grace and amiable sight. <line>for of the soul the body form doth take: <line>for soul is form, and doth the body make. <line>therefore wherever that thou dost behold <line>a comely corpse, with beauty fair endued, <line>know this for certain, that the same doth hold <line>a beauteous soul, with fair conditions thewed, <line>fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed. <line>for all that fair is, is by nature good; <line>that is a sign to know the gentle blood. <line>yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind <line>dwells in deformed tabernacle drown'd, <line>either by chance, against the course of kind, <line>or through unaptness in the substance found, <line>which it assumed of some stubborn ground, <line>that will not yield unto her form's direction, <line>but is deform'd with some foul imperfection. <line>and oft it falls, (ay me, the more to rue) <line>that goodly beauty, albe heavenly born, <line>is foul abus'd, and that celestial hue, <line>which doth the world with her delight adorn, <line>made but the bait of sin, and sinners' scorn, <line>whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it, <line>but every one doth seek but to deprave it. <line>yet nathëmore is that fair beauty's blame, <line>but theirs that do abuse it unto ill: <line>nothing so good, but that through guilty shame <line>may be corrupt, and wrested unto will: <line>natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still, <line>however flesh{""e}s fault it filthy make; <line>for things immortal no corruption take. <line>but ye fair dames, the world's dear ornaments <line>and lively images of heaven's light, <line>let not your beams with such disparagements <line>be dimm'd, and your bright glory dark'ned quite; <line>but mindful still of your first country's sight, <line>do still preserve your first informed grace, <line>whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face. <line>loathe that foul blot, that hellish firebrand, <line>disloyal lust, fair beauty's foulest blame, <line>that base affections, which your ears would bland, <line>commend to you by love's abused name, <line>but is indeed the bondslave of defame; <line>which will the garland of your glory mar, <line>and quench the light of your bright shining star. <line>but gentle love, that loyal is and true, <line>will more illumine your resplendent ray, <line>and add more brightness to your goodly hue, <line>from light of his pure fire; which, by like way <line>kindled of yours, your likeness doth display; <line>like as two mirrors, by oppos'd reflection, <line>do both express the face's first impression. <line>therefore, to make your beauty more appear, <line>it you behoves to love, and forth to lay <line>that heavenly riches which in you ye bear, <line>that men the more admire their fountain may; <line>for else what booteth that celestial ray, <line>if it in darkness be enshrined ever, <line>that it of loving eyes be viewed never? <line>but, in your choice of loves, this well advise, <line>that likest to yourselves ye them select, <line>the which your forms' first source may sympathize, <line>and with like beauty's parts be inly deckt; <line>for, if you loosely love without respect, <line>it is no love, but a discordant war, <line>whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar. <line>for love is a celestial harmony <line>of likely hearts compos'd of stars' concent, <line>which join together in sweet sympathy, <line>to work each other's joy and true content, <line>which they have harbour'd since their first descent <line>out of their heavenly bowers, where they did see <line>and know each other here belov'd to be. <line>then wrong it were that any other twain <line>should in love's gentle band combined be <line>but those whom heaven did at first ordain, <line>and made out of one mould the more t' agree; <line>for all that like the beauty which they see, <line>straight do not love; for love is not so light <line>as straight to burn at first beholder's sight. <line>but they, which love indeed, look otherwise, <line>with pure regard and spotless true intent, <line>drawing out of the object of their eyes <line>a more refined form, which they present <line>unto their mind, void of all blemishment; <line>which it reducing to her first perfection, <line>beholdeth free from flesh's frail infection. <line>and then conforming it unto the light, <line>which in itself it hath remaining still, <line>of that first sun, yet sparkling in his sight, <line>thereof he fashions in his higher skill <line>an heavenly beauty to his fancy's will; <line>and it embracing in his mind entire, <line>the mirror of his own thought doth admire. <line>which seeing now so inly fair to be, <line>as outward it appeareth to the eye, <line>and with his spirit's proportion to agree, <line>he thereon fixeth all his fantasy, <line>and fully setteth his felicity; <line>counting it fairer than it is indeed, <line>and yet indeed her fairness doth exceed. <line>for lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be <line>than other men's, and in dear love's delight <line>see more than any other eyes can see, <line>through mutual receipt of beam{""e}s bright, <line>which carry privy message to the spright, <line>and to their eyes that inmost fair display, <line>as plain as light discovers dawning day. <line>therein they see, through amorous eye-glances, <line>armies of loves still flying to and fro, <line>which dart at them their little fiery lances; <line>whom having wounded, back again they go, <line>carrying compassion to their lovely foe; <line>who, seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect, <line>cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect. <line>in which how many wonders do they rede <line>to their conceit, that others never see, <line>now of her smiles, with which their souls they feed, <line>like gods with nectar in their banquets free; <line>now of her looks, which like to cordials be; <line>but when her words' embássade forth she sends, <line>lord, how sweet music that unto them lends. <line>sometimes upon her forehead they behold <line>a thousand graces masking in delight; <line>sometimes within her eyelids they unfold <line>ten thousand sweet belgards, which to their sight <line>do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night; <line>but on her lips, like rosy buds in may, <line>so many millions of chaste pleasures play. <line>all those, o cytherea, and thousands more <line>thy handmaids be, which do on thee attend, <line>to deck thy beauty with their dainties' store, <line>that may it more to mortal eyes commend, <line>and make it more admir'd of foe and friend: <line>that in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install, <line>and spread thy lovely kingdom over all. <line>then iö, triumph! o great beauty's queen, <line>advance the banner of thy conquest high, <line>that all this world, the which thy vassals bene, <line>may draw to thee, and with due fealty <line>adore the power of thy great majesty, <line>singing this hymn in honour of thy name, <line>compil'd by me, which thy poor liegeman am. <line>in lieu whereof grant, o great sovereign, <line>that she whose conquering beauty doth captive <line>my trembling heart in her eternal chain, <line>one drop of grace at length will to me give, <line>that i her bounden thrall by her may live, <line>and this same life, which first fro me she reaved, <line>may owe to her, of whom i it received. <line>and you, fair venus' darling, my dear dread, <line>fresh flower of grace, great goddess of my life, <line>when your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read, <line>deign to let fall one drop of due relief, <line>that may recure my heart's long pining grief, <line>and shew what wondrous power your beauty hath, <line>that can restore a damned wight from death. <line> <line>","love,desire,realistic & complicated,relationships"

11582,7033,"<line> <line>in pious times, ere priest-craft did begin, <line>before polygamy was made a sin; <line>when man, on many, multipli'd his kind, <line>ere one to one was cursedly confin'd: <line>when nature prompted, and no law deni'd <line>promiscuous use of concubine and bride; <line>then, israel's monarch, after heaven's own heart, <line>his vigorous warmth did variously impart <line>to wives and slaves: and, wide as his command, <line>scatter'd his maker's image through the land. <line>michal, of royal blood, the crown did wear; <line>a soil ungrateful to the tiller's care: <line>not so the rest; for several mothers bore <line>to god-like david, several sons before. <line>but since like slaves his bed they did ascend, <line>no true succession could their seed attend. <line>of all this numerous progeny was none <line>so beautiful, so brave, as absalom: <line>whether, inspir'd by some diviner lust, <line>his father got him with a greater gust; <line>or that his conscious destiny made way, <line>by manly beauty to imperial sway. <line>early in foreign fields he won renown, <line>with kings and states alli'd to israel's crown: <line>in peace the thoughts of war he could remove, <line>and seem'd as he were only born for love. <line>whate'er he did, was done with so much ease, <line>in him alone, 'twas natural to please: <line>his motions all accompani'd with grace; <line>and paradise was open'd in his face. <line>with secret joy, indulgent david view'd <line>his youthful image in his son renew'd: <line>to all his wishes nothing he deni'd; <line>and made the charming annabel his bride. <line>what faults he had (for who from faults is free?) <line>his father could not, or he would not see. <line>some warm excesses, which the law forbore, <line>were constru'd youth that purged by boiling o'er: <line>and amnon's murther, by a specious name, <line>was call'd a just revenge for injur'd fame. <line>thus prais'd, and lov'd, the noble youth remain'd, <line>while david, undisturb'd, in sion reign'd. <line>but life can never be sincerely blest: <line>heav'n punishes the bad, and proves the best. <line>the jews, a headstrong, moody, murm'ring race, <line>as ever tri'd th'extent and stretch of grace; <line>god's pamper'd people whom, debauch'd with ease, <line>no king could govern, nor no god could please; <line>(gods they had tri'd of every shape and size, <line>that god-smiths could produce, or priests devise:) <line>these adam-wits, too fortunately free, <line>began to dream they wanted liberty: <line>and when no rule, no precedent, was found <line>of men, by laws less circumscrib'd and bound, <line>they led their wild desires to woods and caves, <line>and thought that all but savages were slaves. <line>they who, when saul was dead, without a blow, <line>made foolish ishbosheth the crown forego; <line>who banisht david did from hebron bring, <line>and, with a general shout, proclaim'd him king: <line>those very jews, who, at their very best, <line>their humour more than loyalty exprest, <line>now, wonder'd why, so long, they had obey'd <line>an idol-monarch which their hands had made: <line>thought they might ruin him they could create; <line>or melt him to that golden calf, a state. <line>but these were random bolts: no form'd design, <line>nor interest made the factious crowd to join: <line>the sober part of israel, free from stain, <line>well knew the value of a peaceful reign: <line>and, looking backward with a wise afright, <line>saw seams of wounds, dishonest to the sight: <line>in contemplation of whose ugly scars, <line>they curst the memory of civil wars. <line>the moderate sort of men, thus qualifi'd, <line>inclin'd the balance to the better side: <line>and, david's mildness manag'd it so well, <line>the bad found no occasion to rebel. <line>but, when to sin our bias'd nature leans, <line>the careful devil is still at hand with means; <line>and providently pimps for ill desires: <line>the good old cause reviv'd, a plot requires. <line>plots, true or false, are necessary things, <line>to raise up common-wealths, and ruin kings. <line> <line> th' inhabitants of old jerusalem <line>were jebusites: the town so call'd from them; <line>and theirs the native right— <line>but when the chosen people grew more strong, <line>the rightful cause at length became the wrong: <line>and every loss the men of jebus bore, <line>they still were thought god's enemies the more. <line>thus, worn and weaken'd, well or ill content, <line>submit they must to david's government: <line>impoverish'd and depriv'd of all command, <line>their taxes doubled as they lost their land; <line>and, what was harder yet to flesh and blood, <line>their gods disgrac'd, and burnt like common wood. <line>this set the heathen priesthood in a flame; <line>for priests of all religions are the same: <line>of whatsoe'er descent their godhead be, <line>stock, stone, or other homely pedigree, <line>in his defence his servants are as bold, <line>as if he had been born of beaten gold. <line>the jewish rabbins though their enemies, <line>in this conclude them honest men and wise: <line>for 'twas their duty, all the learned think, <line>t'espouse his cause by whom they eat and drink. <line>from hence began that plot, the nation's curse, <line>bad in itself, but represented worse. <line>rais'd in extremes, and in extremes decri'd; <line>with oaths affirm'd, with dying vows deni'd. <line>not weigh'd, or winnow'd by the multitude; <line>but swallow'd in the mass, unchew'd and crude. <line>some truth there was, but dash'd and brew'd with lies; <line>to please the fools, and puzzle all the wise. <line>succeeding times did equal folly call, <line>believing nothing, or believing all. <line>th' egyptian rites the jebusites embrac'd; <line>where gods were recommended by their taste. <line>such sav'ry deities must needs be good, <line>as serv'd at once for worship and for food. <line>by force they could not introduce these gods; <line>for ten to one, in former days was odds. <line>so fraud was us'd, (the sacrificers' trade,) <line>fools are more hard to conquer than persuade. <line>their busy teachers mingled with the jews; <line>and rak'd, for converts, even the court and stews: <line>which hebrew priests the more unkindly took, <line>because the fleece accompanies the flock. <line>some thought they god's anointed meant to slay <line>by guns, invented since full many a day: <line>our author swears it not; but who can know <line>how far the devil and jebusites may go? <line>this plot, which fail'd for want of common sense, <line>had yet a deep and dangerous consequence: <line>for, as when raging fevers boil the blood, <line>the standing lake soon floats into a flood; <line>and ev'ry hostile humour, which before <line>slept quiet in its channels, bubbles o'er: <line>so, several factions from this first ferment, <line>work up to foam, and threat the government. <line>some by their friends, more by themselves thought wise, <line>oppos'd the pow'r, to which they could not rise. <line>some had in courts been great, and thrown from thence, <line>like fiends, were harden'd in impenitence. <line>some by their monarch's fatal mercy grown, <line>from pardon'd rebels, kinsmen to the throne; <line>were rais'd in pow'r and public office high; <line>strong bands, if bands ungrateful men could tie. <line> <line> of these the false achitophel was first: <line>a name to all succeeding ages curst. <line>for close designs, and crooked counsels fit; <line>sagacious, bold and turbulent of wit: <line>restless, unfixt in principles and place; <line>in pow'r unpleas'd, impatient of disgrace. <line>a fiery soul, which working out its way, <line>fretted the pigmy-body to decay: <line>and o'er inform'd the tenement of clay. <line>a daring pilot in extremity; <line>pleas'd with the danger, when the waves went high <line>he sought the storms; but for a calm unfit, <line>would steer too nigh the sands, to boast his wit. <line>great wits are sure to madness near alli'd; <line>and thin partitions do their bounds divide: <line>else, why should he, with wealth and honour blest, <line>refuse his age the needful hours of rest? <line>punish a body which he could not please; <line>bankrupt of life, yet prodigal of ease? <line>and all to leave, what with his toil he won <line>to that unfeather'd, two-legg'd thing, a son: <line>got, while his soul did huddled notions try; <line>and born a shapeless lump, like anarchy. <line>in friendship false, implacable in hate: <line>resolv'd to ruin or to rule the state. <line>to compass this, the triple bond he broke; <line>the pillars of the public safety shook: <line>and fitted israel for a foreign yoke. <line>then, seiz'd with fear, yet still affecting fame, <line>usurp'd a patriot's all-atoning name. <line>so easy still it proves in factious times, <line>with public zeal to cancel private crimes: <line>how safe is treason, and how sacred ill, <line>where none can sin against the people's will: <line>where crowds can wink; and no offence be known, <line>since in another's guilt they find their own. <line>yet, fame deserv'd, no enemy can grudge; <line>the statesman we abhor, but praise the judge. <line>in jewish courts ne'er sat an abbethdin <line>with more discerning eyes, or hands more clean: <line>unbrib'd, unsought, the wretched to redress; <line>swift of dispatch, and easy of access. <line>oh, had he been content to serve the crown, <line>with virtues only proper to the gown; <line>or, had the rankness of the soil been freed <line>from cockle, that opprest the noble seed: <line>david, for him his tuneful harp had strung, <line>and heav'n had wanted one immortal song. <line>but wild ambition loves to slide, not stand; <line>and fortune's ice prefers to virtue's land: <line>achitophel, grown weary to possess <line>a lawful fame, and lazy happiness; <line>disdain'd the golden fruit to gather free, <line>and lent the crowd his arm to shake the tree. <line>now, manifest of crimes, contriv'd long since, <line>he stood at bold defiance with his prince: <line>held up the buckler of the people's cause, <line>against the crown; and skulk'd behind the laws. <line>the wish'd occasion of the plot he takes; <line>some circumstances finds, but more he makes. <line>by buzzing emissaries, fills the ears <line>of list'ning crowds, with jealousies and fears <line>of arbitrary counsels brought to light, <line>and proves the king himself a jebusite. <line>weak arguments! which yet he knew full well, <line>were strong with people easy to rebel. <line>for, govern'd by the moon, the giddy jews <line>tread the same track when she the prime renews: <line>and once in twenty years, their scribes record, <line>by natural instinct they change their lord. <line>achitophel still wants a chief, and none <line>was found so fit as warlike absalom: <line>not, that he wish'd his greatness to create, <line>(for politicians neither love nor hate:) <line>but, for he knew, his title not allow'd, <line>would keep him still depending on the crowd: <line>that kingly pow'r, thus ebbing out, might be <line>drawn to the dregs of a democracy. <line>him he attempts, with studied arts to please, <line>and sheds his venom, in such words as these. <line> <line> auspicious prince! at whose nativity <line>some royal planet rul'd the southern sky; <line>thy longing country's darling and desire; <line>their cloudy pillar, and their guardian fire: <line>their second moses, whose extended wand <line>divides the seas, and shows the promis'd land: <line>whose dawning day, in very distant age, <line>has exercis'd the sacred prophet's rage: <line>the people's pray'r, the glad diviner's theme, <line>the young men's vision, and the old men's dream! <line>thee, saviour, thee, the nation's vows confess; <line>and, never satisfi'd with seeing, bless: <line>swift, unbespoken pomps, thy steps proclaim, <line>and stammering babes are taught to lisp thy name. <line>how long wilt thou the general joy detain; <line>starve, and defraud the people of thy reign? <line>content ingloriously to pass thy days <line>like one of virtue's fools that feeds on praise; <line>till thy fresh glories, which now shine so bright, <line>grow stale and tarnish with our daily sight. <line>believe me, royal youth, thy fruit must be, <line>or gather'd ripe, or rot upon the tree. <line>heav'n has to all allotted, soon or late, <line>some lucky revolution of their fate: <line>whose motions if we watch and guide with skill, <line>(for human good depends on human will,) <line>our fortune rolls, as from a smooth descent, <line>and, from the first impression, takes the bent: <line>but, if unseiz'd, she glides away like wind; <line>and leaves repenting folly far behind. <line>now, now she meets you, with a glorious prize, <line>and spreads her locks before her as she flies. <line>had thus old david, from whose loins you spring, <line>not dar'd, when fortune call'd him, to be king. <line>at gath an exile he might still remain; <line>and heaven's anointing oil had been in vain. <line>let his successful youth your hopes engage; <line>but shun th'example of declining age: <line>behold him setting in his western skies, <line>the shadows lengthening as the vapours rise. <line>he is not now, as when on jordan's sand <line>the joyful people throng'd to see him land, <line>cov'ring the beach, and black'ning all the strand: <line>but, like the prince of angels from his height, <line>comes tumbling downward with diminish'd light: <line>betray'd by one poor plot to public scorn: <line>(our only blessing since his curst return:) <line>those heaps of people which one sheaf did bind, <line>blown off, and scatter'd by a puff of wind. <line>what strength can he to your designs oppose, <line>naked of friends and round beset with foes? <line>if pharaoh's doubtful succour he should use, <line>a foreign aid would more incense the jews: <line>proud egypt would dissembled friendship bring; <line>foment the war, but not support the king: <line>nor would the royal party e'er unite <line>with pharaoh's arms, t'assist the jebusite; <line>or if they should, their interest soon would break, <line>and with such odious aid, make david weak. <line>all sorts of men, by my successful arts, <line>abhorring kings, estrange their alter'd hearts <line>from david's rule: and 'tis the general cry, <line>religion, common-wealth, and liberty. <line>if, you, as champion of the public good, <line>add to their arms a chief of royal blood; <line>what may not israel hope, and what applause <line>might such a general gain by such a cause? <line>not barren praise alone, that gaudy flow'r, <line>fair only to the sight, but solid pow'r: <line>and nobler is a limited command, <line>giv'n by the love of all your native land, <line>than a successive title, long, and dark, <line>drawn from the mouldy rolls of noah's ark. <line> <line> what cannot praise effect in mighty minds, <line>when flattery soothes, and when ambition blinds! <line>desire of pow'r, on earth a vicious weed, <line>yet, sprung from high, is of celestial seed: <line>in god 'tis glory: and when men aspire, <line>'tis but a spark too much of heavenly fire. <line>th' ambitious youth, too covetous of fame, <line>too full of angel's metal in his frame; <line>unwarily was led from virtue's ways; <line>made drunk with honour, and debauch'd with praise. <line>half loath, and half consenting to the ill, <line>(for loyal blood within him struggled still) <line>he thus repli'd.—and what pretence have i <line>to take up arms for public liberty? <line>my father governs with unquestion'd right; <line>the faith's defender, and mankind's delight: <line>good, gracious, just, observant of the laws; <line>and heav'n by wonders has espous'd his cause. <line>whom has he wrong'd in all his peaceful reign? <line>who sues for justice to his throne in vain? <line>what millions has he pardon'd of his foes, <line>whom just revenge did to his wrath expose? <line>mild, easy, humble, studious of our good; <line>inclin'd to mercy, and averse from blood. <line>if mildness ill with stubborn israel suit, <line>his crime is god's beloved attribute. <line>what could he gain, his people to betray, <line>or change his right, for arbitrary sway? <line>let haughty pharaoh curse with such a reign, <line>his fruitful nile, and yoke a servile train. <line>if david's rule jerusalem displease, <line>the dog-star heats their brains to this disease. <line>why then should i, encouraging the bad, <line>turn rebel, and run popularly mad? <line>were he a tyrant who, by lawless might, <line>oppress'd the jews, and rais'd the jebusite, <line>well might i mourn; but nature's holy bands <line>would curb my spirits, and restrain my hands: <line>the people might assert their liberty; <line>but what was right in them, were crime in me. <line>his favour leaves me nothing to require; <line>prevents my wishes, and out-runs desire. <line>what more can i expect while david lives? <line>all but his kingly diadem he gives: <line>and that: but there he paus'd; then sighing, said, <line>is justly destin'd for a worthier head. <line>for when my father from his toils shall rest, <line>and late augment the number of the blest: <line>his lawful issue shall the throne ascend; <line>or the collat'ral line where that shall end. <line>his brother, though oppress'd with vulgar spite, <line>yet dauntless and secure of native right, <line>of every royal virtue stands possess'd; <line>still dear to all the bravest, and the best. <line>his courage foes, his friends his truth proclaim; <line>his loyalty the king, the world his fame. <line>his mercy ev'n th'offending crowd will find: <line>for sure he comes of a forgiving kind. <line>why should i then repine at heaven's decree; <line>which gives me no pretence to royalty? <line>yet oh that fate, propitiously inclin'd, <line>had rais'd my birth, or had debas'd my mind; <line>to my large soul, not all her treasure lent, <line>and then betray'd it to a mean descent. <line>i find, i find my mounting spirits bold, <line>and david's part disdains my mother's mold. <line>why am i scanted by a niggard-birth? <line>my soul disclaims the kindred of her earth: <line>and made for empire, whispers me within; <line>desire of greatness is a god-like sin. <line> <line> him staggering so when hell's dire agent found, <line>while fainting virtue scarce maintain'd her ground, <line>he pours fresh forces in, and thus replies: <line> <line> th'eternal god, supremely good and wise, <line>imparts not these prodigious gifts in vain; <line>what wonders are reserv'd to bless your reign? <line>against your will your arguments have shown, <line>such virtue's only giv'n to guide a throne. <line>not that your father's mildness i contemn; <line>but manly force becomes the diadem. <line>'tis true, he grants the people all they crave; <line>and more perhaps than subjects ought to have: <line>for lavish grants suppose a monarch tame, <line>and more his goodness than his wit proclaim. <line>but when should people strive their bonds to break, <line>if not when kings are negligent or weak? <line>let him give on till he can give no more, <line>the thrifty sanhedrin shall keep him poor: <line>and every shekel which he can receive, <line>shall cost a limb of his prerogative. <line>to ply him with new plots, shall be my care; <line>or plunge him deep in some expensive war; <line>which, when his treasure can no more supply, <line>he must, with the remains of kingship, buy. <line>his faithful friends, our jealousies and fears <line>call jebusites; and pharaoh's pensioners: <line>whom, when our fury from his aid has torn, <line>he shall be naked left to public scorn. <line>the next successor, whom i fear and hate, <line>my arts have made obnoxious to the state; <line>turn'd all his virtues to his overthrow, <line>and gain'd our elders to pronounce a foe. <line>his right, for sums of necessary gold, <line>shall first be pawn'd, and afterwards be sold: <line>till time shall ever-wanting david draw, <line>to pass your doubtful title into law: <line>if not; the people have a right supreme <line>to make their kings; for kings are made for them. <line>all empire is no more than pow'r in trust: <line>which when resum'd, can be no longer just. <line>succession, for the general good design'd, <line>in its own wrong a nation cannot bind: <line>if altering that, the people can relieve, <line>better one suffer, than a nation grieve. <line>the jews well know their pow'r: ere saul they chose, <line>god was their king, and god they durst depose. <line>urge now your piety, your filial name, <line>a father's right, and fear of future fame; <line>the public good, the universal call, <line>to which even heav'n submitted, answers all. <line>nor let his love enchant your generous mind; <line>'tis nature's trick to propagate her kind. <line>our fond begetters, who would never die, <line>love but themselves in their posterity. <line>or let his kindness by th'effects be tri'd, <line>or let him lay his vain pretence aside. <line>god said he lov'd your father; could he bring <line>a better proof, than to anoint him king? <line>it surely show'd he lov'd the shepherd well, <line>who gave so fair a flock as israel. <line>would david have you thought his darling son? <line>what means he then, to alienate the crown? <line>the name of godly he may blush to bear: <line>'tis after god's own heart to cheat his heir. <line>he to his brother gives supreme command; <line>to you a legacy of barren land: <line>perhaps th'old harp, on which he thrums his lays: <line>or some dull hebrew ballad in your praise. <line>then the next heir, a prince, severe and wise <line>already looks on you with jealous eyes; <line>sees through the thin disguises of your arts, <line>and marks your progress in the people's hearts. <line>though now his mighty soul in grief contains, <line>he meditates revenge who least complains; <line>and like a lion, slumb'ring in the way, <line>or sleep-dissembling, while he waits his prey, <line>his fearless foes within his distance draws; <line>constrains his roaring and contracts his paws: <line>till at the last, his time for fury found, <line>he shoots with sudden vengeance from the ground: <line>the prostrate vulgar, passes o'er, and spares; <line>but with a lordly rage, his hunters tears. <line>your case no tame expedients will afford; <line>resolve on death, or conquest by the sword, <line>which for no less a stake than life, you draw; <line>and self-defence is nature's eldest law. <line>leave the warm people no considering time; <line>for then rebellion may be thought a crime. <line>prevail yourself of what occasion gives, <line>but try your title while your father lives: <line>and that your arms may have a fair pretence, <line>proclaim, you take them in the king's defence: <line>whose sacred life each minute would expose <line>to plots from seeming friends and secret foes. <line>and who can sound the depth of david's soul? <line>perhaps his fear, his kindness may control. <line>he fears his brother, though he loves his son, <line>for plighted vows too late to be undone. <line>if so, by force he wishes to be gain'd; <line>like women's lechery, to seem constrain'd: <line>doubt not; but when he most affects the frown, <line>commit a pleasing rape upon the crown. <line>secure his person to secure your cause; <line>they who possess the prince, possess the laws. <line> <line> he said, and this advice above the rest <line>with absalom's mild nature suited best; <line>unblam'd of life, (ambition set aside,) <line>not stain'd with cruelty, nor puff'd with pride. <line>how happy had he been, if destiny <line>had higher plac'd his birth, or not so high! <line>his kingly virtues might have claim'd a throne; <line>and blest all other countries but his own: <line>but charming greatness since so few refuse, <line>'tis juster to lament him, than accuse. <line>strong were his hopes a rival to remove, <line>with blandishments to gain the public love; <line>to head the faction while their zeal was hot, <line>and popularly prosecute the plot. <line>to farther this achitophel unites <line>the malcontents of all the israelites: <line>whose differing parties he could wisely join, <line>for several ends, to serve the same design. <line>the best, and of the princes some were such, <line>who thought the pow'r of monarchy too much: <line>mistaken men, and patriots in their hearts; <line>not wicked, but seduc'd by impious arts. <line>by these the springs of property were bent, <line>and wound so high, they crack'd the government. <line>the next for interest sought t'embroil the state, <line>to sell their duty at a dearer rate; <line>and make their jewish markets of the throne; <line>pretending public good, to serve their own. <line>others thought kings an useless heavy load, <line>who cost too much, and did too little good. <line>these were for laying honest david by, <line>on principles of pure good husbandry. <line>with them join'd all th'haranguers of the throng, <line>that thought to get preferment by the tongue. <line>who follow next, a double danger bring, <line>not only hating david, but the king; <line>the solymaean rout; well vers'd of old <line>in godly faction, and in treason bold; <line>cow'ring and quaking at a conqu'ror's sword, <line>but lofty to a lawful prince restor'd; <line>saw with disdain an ethnic plot begun, <line>and scorn'd by jebusites to be out-done. <line>hot levites headed these; who pull'd before <line>from th'ark, which in the judges' days they bore, <line>resum'd their cant, and with a zealous cry, <line>pursu'd their old belov'd theocracy. <line>where sanhedrin and priest enslav'd the nation, <line>and justifi'd their spoils by inspiration: <line>for who so fit for reign as aaron's race, <line>if once dominion they could found in grace? <line>these led the pack; though not of surest scent, <line>yet deepest mouth'd against the government. <line>a numerous host of dreaming saints succeed; <line>of the true old enthusiastic breed: <line>'gainst form and order they their pow'r employ; <line>nothing to build, and all things to destroy. <line>but far more numerous was the herd of such, <line>who think too little, and who talk too much. <line>these, out of mere instinct, they knew not why, <line>ador'd their father's god, and property: <line>and by the same blind benefit of fate, <line>the devil and the jebusite did hate: <line>born to be saved even in their own despite; <line>because they could not help believing right. <line>such were the tools; but a whole hydra more <line>remains, of sprouting heads too long, to score. <line>some of their chiefs were princes of the land: <line>in the first rank of these did zimri stand: <line>a man so various, that he seem'd to be <line>not one, but all mankind's epitome. <line>stiff in opinions, always in the wrong; <line>was everything by starts, and nothing long: <line>but in the course of one revolving moon, <line>was chemist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon: <line>then all for women, painting, rhyming, drinking; <line>besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking. <line>blest madman, who could every hour employ, <line>with something new to wish, or to enjoy! <line>railing and praising were his usual themes; <line>and both (to show his judgment) in extremes: <line>so over violent, or over civil, <line>that every man, with him, was god or devil. <line>in squandering wealth was his peculiar art: <line>nothing went unrewarded, but desert. <line>beggar'd by fools, whom still he found too late: <line>he had his jest, and they had his estate. <line>he laugh'd himself from court; then sought relief <line>by forming parties, but could ne'er be chief: <line>for, spite of him, the weight of business fell <line>on absalom and wise achitophel: <line>thus, wicked but in will, of means bereft, <line>he left not faction, but of that was left. <line> <line> titles and names 'twere tedious to rehearse <line>of lords, below the dignity of verse. <line>wits, warriors, commonwealths-men, were the best: <line>kind husbands and mere nobles all the rest. <line>and, therefore in the name of dullness, be <line>the well-hung balaam and cold caleb free. <line>and canting nadab let oblivion damn, <line>who made new porridge for the paschal lamb. <line>let friendship's holy band some names assure: <line>some their own worth, and some let scorn secure. <line>nor shall the rascal rabble here have place, <line>whom kings no titles gave, and god no grace: <line>not bull-faced jonas, who could statutes draw <line>to mean rebellion, and make treason law. <line>but he, though bad, is follow'd by a worse, <line>the wretch, who heav'n's anointed dar'd to curse. <line>shimei, whose youth did early promise bring <line>of zeal to god, and hatred to his king; <line>did wisely from expensive sins refrain, <line>and never broke the sabbath, but for gain: <line>nor ever was he known an oath to vent, <line>or curse, unless against the government. <line>thus, heaping wealth, by the most ready way <line>among the jews, which was to cheat and pray; <line>the city, to reward his pious hate <line>against his master, chose him magistrate: <line>his hand a vare of justice did uphold; <line>his neck was loaded with a chain of gold. <line>during his office, treason was no crime. <line>the sons of belial had a glorious time: <line>for shimei, though not prodigal of pelf, <line>yet lov'd his wicked neighbour as himself: <line>when two or three were gather'd to declaim <line>against the monarch of jerusalem, <line>shimei was always in the midst of them. <line>and, if they curst the king when he was by, <line>would rather curse, than break good company. <line>if any durst his factious friends accuse, <line>he pack'd a jury of dissenting jews: <line>whose fellow-feeling, in the godly cause, <line>would free the suff'ring saint from human laws. <line>for laws are only made to punish those <line>who serve the king, and to protect his foes. <line>if any leisure time he had from pow'r, <line>(because 'tis sin to mis-employ an hour;) <line>his bus'ness was, by writing, to persuade, <line>that kings were useless, and a clog to trade: <line>and, that his noble style he might refine, <line>no rechabite more shunn'd the fumes of wine. <line>chaste were his cellars; and his shrieval board <line>the grossness of a city feast abhorr'd: <line>his cooks, with long disuse, their trade forgot; <line>cool was his kitchen, though his brains were hot. <line>such frugal virtue malice may accuse; <line>but sure 'twas necessary to the jews: <line>for towns once burnt, such magistrates require <line>as dare not tempt god's providence by fire. <line>with spiritual food he fed his servants well, <line>but free from flesh, that made the jews rebel: <line>and moses' laws he held in more account <line>for forty days of fasting in the mount. <line>to speak the rest, who better are forgot, <line>would tire a well-breath'd witness of the plot: <line>yet, corah, thou shalt from oblivion pass; <line>erect thyself thou monumental brass: <line>high as the serpent of thy metal made, <line>while nations stand secure beneath thy shade. <line>what though his birth were base, yet comets rise <line>from earthy vapours e'er they shine in skies. <line>prodigious actions may as well be done <line>by weaver's issue, as by prince's son. <line>this arch-attestor, for the public good, <line>by that one deed ennobles all his blood. <line>who ever ask'd the witnesses' high race, <line>whose oath with martyrdom did stephen grace? <line>ours was a levite, and as times went then, <line>his tribe were god-almighty's gentlemen. <line>sunk were his eyes, his voice was harsh and loud, <line>sure signs he neither choleric was, nor proud: <line>his long chin prov'd his wit; his saint-like grace <line>a church vermilion, and a moses' face. <line>his memory, miraculously great, <line>could plots exceeding man's belief, repeat; <line>which therefore cannot be accounted lies, <line>for human wit could never such devise. <line>some future truths are mingled in his book; <line>but, where the witness fail'd, the prophet spoke: <line>some things like visionary flights appear; <line>the spirit caught him up, the lord knows where: <line>and gave him his rabbinical degree, <line>unknown to foreign university. <line>his judgment yet his mem'ry did excel: <line>which piec'd his wondrous evidence so well: <line>and suited to the temper of the times; <line>then groaning under jebusitic crimes. <line>let israel's foes suspect his heav'nly call, <line>and rashly judge his writ apocryphal; <line>our laws for such affronts have forfeits made: <line>he takes his life, who takes away his trade. <line>were i myself in witness corah's place, <line>the wretch who did me such a dire disgrace, <line>should whet my memory, though once forgot, <line>to make him an appendix of my plot. <line>his zeal to heav'n made him his prince despise, <line>and load his person with indignities: <line>but zeal peculiar privilege affords, <line>indulging latitude to deeds and words. <line>and corah might for agag's murther call, <line>in terms as coarse as samuel us'd to saul. <line>what others in his evidence did join, <line>(the best that could be had for love or coin,) <line>in corah's own predicament will fall: <line>for witness is a common name to all. <line> <line> surrounded thus with friends of every sort, <line>deluded absalom forsakes the court: <line>impatient of high hopes, urg'd with renown, <line>and fir'd with near possession of a crown: <line>th' admiring crowd are dazzled with surprise, <line>and on his goodly person feed their eyes: <line>his joy conceal'd, he sets himself to show; <line>on each side bowing popularly low: <line>his looks, his gestures, and his words he frames, <line>and with familiar ease repeats their names. <line>thus, form'd by nature, furnish'd out with arts, <line>he glides unfelt into their secret hearts: <line>then, with a kind compassionating look, <line>and sighs, bespeaking pity e'er he spoke: <line>few words he said; but easy those and fit: <line>more slow than hybla drops, and far more sweet. <line> <line> i mourn, my country-men, your lost estate; <line>though far unable to prevent your fate: <line>behold a banish'd man, for your dear cause <line>expos'd a prey to arbitrary laws! <line>yet oh! that i alone could be undone, <line>cut off from empire, and no more a son! <line>now all your liberties a spoil are made; <line>egypt and tyrus intercept your trade, <line>and jebusites your sacred rites invade. <line>my father, whom with reverence yet i name, <line>charm'd into ease, is careless of his fame: <line>and, brib'd with petty sums of foreign gold, <line>is grown in bathsheba's embraces old: <line>exalts his enemies, his friends destroys: <line>and all his pow'r against himself employs. <line>he gives, and let him give my right away: <line>but why should he his own, and yours betray? <line>he, only he can make the nation bleed, <line>and he alone from my revenge is freed. <line>take then my tears (with that he wip'd his eyes) <line>'tis all the aid my present pow'r supplies: <line>no court-informer can these arms accuse; <line>these arms may sons against their fathers use; <line>and, 'tis my wish, the next successor's reign <line>may make no other israelite complain. <line> <line> youth, beauty, graceful action, seldom fail: <line>but common interest always will prevail: <line>and pity never ceases to be shown <line>to him, who makes the people's wrongs his own. <line>the crowd, (that still believe their kings oppress,) <line>with lifted hands their young messiah bless: <line>who now begins his progress to ordain; <line>with chariots, horsemen, and a num'rous train: <line>from east to west his glories he displays: <line>and, like the sun, the promis'd land surveys. <line>fame runs before him, as the morning-star; <line>and shouts of joy salute him from afar: <line>each house receives him as a guardian god; <line>and consecrates the place of his abode: <line>but hospitable treats did most commend <line>wise issachar, his wealthy western friend. <line>this moving court, that caught the people's eyes, <line>and seem'd but pomp, did other ends disguise: <line>achitophel had form'd it, with intent <line>to sound the depths, and fathom where it went, <line>the people's hearts; distinguish friends from foes; <line>and try their strength, before they came to blows. <line>yet all was colour'd with a smooth pretence <line>of specious love, and duty to their prince. <line>religion, and redress of grievances, <line>two names, that always cheat and always please, <line>are often urg'd; and good king david's life <line>endanger'd by a brother and a wife. <line>thus, in a pageant show, a plot is made; <line>and peace itself is war in masquerade. <line>oh foolish israel! never warn'd by ill: <line>still the same bait, and circumvented still! <line>did ever men forsake their present ease, <line>in midst of health imagine a disease; <line>take pains contingent mischiefs to foresee, <line>make heirs for monarchs, and for god decree? <line>what shall we think! can people give away <line>both for themselves and sons, their native sway? <line>then they are left defenceless to the sword <line>of each unbounded arbitrary lord: <line>and laws are vain, by which we right enjoy, <line>if kings unquestion'd can those laws destroy. <line>yet, if the crowd be judge of fit and just, <line>and kings are only officers in trust, <line>then this resuming cov'nant was declar'd <line>when kings were made, or is for ever bar'd: <line>if those who gave the sceptre could not tie <line>by their own deed their own posterity, <line>how then could adam bind his future race? <line>how could his forfeit on mankind take place? <line>or how could heavenly justice damn us all, <line>who ne'er consented to our father's fall? <line>then kings are slaves to those whom they command, <line>and tenants to their people's pleasure stand. <line>add, that the pow'r for property allow'd, <line>is mischievously seated in the crowd: <line>for who can be secure of private right, <line>if sovereign sway may be dissolv'd by might? <line>nor is the people's judgment always true: <line>the most may err as grossly as the few. <line>and faultless kings run down, by common cry, <line>for vice, oppression and for tyranny. <line>what standard is there in a fickle rout, <line>which, flowing to the mark, runs faster out? <line>nor only crowds, but sanhedrins may be <line>infected with this public lunacy: <line>and share the madness of rebellious times, <line>to murther monarchs for imagin'd crimes. <line>if they may give and take whene'er they please, <line>not kings alone, (the godhead's images,) <line>but government itself at length must fall <line>to nature's state, where all have right to all. <line>yet, grant our lords the people kings can make, <line>what prudent men a settled throne would shake? <line>for whatsoe'er their sufferings were before, <line>that change they covet makes them suffer more. <line>all other errors but disturb a state; <line>but innovation is the blow of fate. <line>if ancient fabrics nod, and threat to fall, <line>to patch the flaws, and buttress up the wall, <line>thus far 'tis duty; but here fix the mark: <line>for all beyond it is to touch our ark. <line>to change foundations, cast the frame anew, <line>is work for rebels who base ends pursue: <line>at once divine and human laws control; <line>and mend the parts by ruin of the whole. <line>the tamp'ring world is subject to this curse, <line>to physic their disease into a worse. <line> <line> now what relief can righteous david bring? <line>how fatal 'tis to be too good a king! <line>friends he has few, so high the madness grows; <line>who dare be such, must be the people's foes: <line>yet some there were, ev'n in the worst of days; <line>some let me name, and naming is to praise. <line> <line> in this short file barzillai first appears; <line>barzillai crown'd with honour and with years: <line>long since, the rising rebels he withstood <line>in regions waste, beyond the jordan's flood: <line>unfortunately brave to buoy the state; <line>but sinking underneath his master's fate: <line>in exile with his god-like prince he mourn'd: <line>for him he suffer'd, and with him return'd. <line>the court he practis'd, not the courtier's art: <line>large was his wealth, but larger was his heart: <line>which well the noblest objects knew to choose, <line>the fighting warrior, and recording muse. <line>his bed could once a fruitful issue boast: <line>now more than half a father's name is lost. <line>his eldest hope, with every grace adorn'd, <line>by me (so heav'n will have it) always mourn'd, <line>and always honour'd, snatch'd in manhood's prime <line>b' unequal fates, and providence's crime: <line>yet not before the goal of honour won, <line>all parts fulfill'd, of subject and of son; <line>swift was the race, but short the time to run. <line>oh narrow circle, but of pow'r divine, <line>scanted in space, but perfect in thy line! <line>by sea, by land, thy matchless worth was known; <line>arms thy delight, and war was all thy own: <line>thy force infus'd, the fainting tyrians propp'd: <line>and haughty pharaoh found his fortune stopp'd. <line>oh ancient honour, oh unconquer'd hand, <line>whom foes unpunish'd never could withstand! <line>but israel was unworthy of thy name: <line>short is the date of all immoderate fame. <line>it looks as heav'n our ruin had design'd, <line>and durst not trust thy fortune and thy mind. <line>now, free from earth, thy disencumber'd soul <line>mounts up, and leaves behind the clouds and starry pole: <line>from thence thy kindred legions may'st thou bring, <line>to aid the guardian angel of thy king. <line>here stop my muse, here cease thy painful flight; <line>no pinions can pursue immortal height: <line>tell good barzillai thou canst sing no more, <line>and tell thy soul she should have fled before; <line>or fled she with his life, and left this verse <line>to hang on her departed patron's hearse? <line>now take thy steepy flight from heav'n, and see <line>if thou canst find on earth another he; <line>another he would be too hard to find, <line>see then whom thou canst see not far behind. <line>zadoc the priest whom, shunning, pow'r and place, <line>his lowly mind advanc'd to david's grace: <line>with him the sagan of jerusalem, <line>of hospitable soul and noble stem; <line>him of the western dome, whose weighty sense <line>flows in fit words and heavenly eloquence. <line>the prophet's sons by such example led, <line>to learning and to loyalty were bred: <line>for colleges on bounteous kings depend, <line>and never rebel was to arts a friend. <line>to these succeed the pillars of the laws, <line>who best could plead, and best can judge a cause. <line>next them a train of loyal peers ascend: <line>sharp judging adriel, the muse's friend, <line>himself a muse:—in sanhedrin's debate <line>true to his prince; but not a slave of state. <line>whom david's love with honours did adorn, <line>that from his disobedient son were torn. <line>jotham of piercing wit and pregnant thought, <line>endow'd by nature, and by learning taught <line>to move assemblies, who but only tri'd <line>the worse awhile, then chose the better side; <line>nor chose alone, but turn'd the balance too; <line>so much the weight of one brave man can do. <line>hushai, the friend of david in distress, <line>in public storms of manly steadfastness; <line>by foreign treaties he inform'd his youth;

<line>they could not be content to look on grace, <line>her hinder parts, but with a daring eye <line>to tempt the terror of her front, and die. <line>by their own arts 'tis righteously decreed, <line>those dire artificers of death shall bleed. <line>against themselves their witnesses will swear, <line>till viper-like their mother plot they tear: <line>and suck for nutriment that bloody gore <line>which was their principle of life before. <line>their belial with the belzebub will fight; <line>thus on my foes, my foes shall do me right: <line>nor doubt th'event: for factious crowds engage <line>in their first onset, all their brutal rage; <line>then, let 'em take an unresisted course: <line>retire and traverse, and delude their force: <line>but when they stand all breathless, urge the fight, <line>and rise upon 'em with redoubled might: <line>for lawful pow'r is still superior found, <line>when long driv'n back, at length it stands the ground. <line> <line> he said. th' almighty, nodding, gave consent;

11583,4756,"<line> <line>from my cell i was staring at a cloud, a dog decaying in the woods, etc., as i took up the long-awaited sequel to my confessions. by this time my hand was so far away that it looked like a small hairless spider whose progress i could hardly help but follow, from the corner of one eye, as it went on filling page after page in a notebook the size of a stamp with words too small for anyone to read. i looked up and noticed my bars had turned to gold. and before i forget, i’d like to be the first to congratulate everyone who has not committed suicide up until now. camouflaged and lightless congregation, the world will never know your names, never know of its debt to you, or what you suffered; with what uncomplaining anguish you sacrificed the one thing all hold most dear, most have in common, the sense of being completely different from anybody else—it just vanished at some point, having attained its sexually mature and winged stage. you had a great vision about it, but told no one. we have misnamed death life and life death. you saw another world, and it was precisely the same as this one. this time you told everyone, until someone asked you very nicely to quiet down. and the weather—everything you have heard on that subject is a serious understatement. the scarlet horrors were preparing to file in for my ignominious obsequies, already they swarmed freely over my body. then, there was no weather. i can’t tell you how perfect that was. as it happens i had been gazing up at the dusk stars, as i can be found doing more or less day and night, for i like to think they are growing younger as i die, come by some time and tell me what you think. under torture—some atrocious form of tickling, for example—i guess i’d describe myself as a fairly good egg in hot water. family motto roughly translates, april wizards bring may blizzards. we tend to be apprehended eventually, after a futile but all the more spirited attempt at first degree self-impersonation; however, this is not the time for levity, we happen to be speaking of a serious medical goodnight kiss. traditionally, we are then detained at a local mental facility known for its celebrated alumni, though in recent decades secret and permanent socialist elements in the government have seen to it that the lowest scum of humanity now appear to have open access to those once hallowed halls smeared with our shit and vomit. what i’m getting at is this: after a relatively brief stay, we are invariably released with some deranged doctor’s or other’s blessing, a mixture of relief and disgust on the part of the staff, and the secret eye-signal that will get you into any movie house in milwaukee free for the next year. some of us like to get together once a day, rain or shine, and gather furtively at the picnic grounds under those tall wavering candleflame pines, where neither moth nor rust can reach, nor faintest scream, and exchange ribald tales verging on satanic perversion, each drawing his iridescent injection from the same oceanic martini, very dry, about two tears’ worth of vermouth, in an unremembered dream. <line>","living,growing old"
11584,550,"<line> <line>i wanted to have a poem and i was pregnant. i was very thin. as if i’d lived on air. a poet must be able to live on air, but a mother must not attempt it. my mother wanted me to buy a set of matching pots, wearever aluminum, like the ones she had. they were heavy and had well fitting lids so my suppers wouldn’t burn. my husband wanted me to give dinner parties. john f. kennedy was running for office. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>i sensed danger. kennedy wasn’t against the bomb or for nuclear disarmament. i joined sane at its inception. also concerned scientists. i spoke with linus pauling and encouraged my husband to help his partner organize physicians for social responsibility. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>there was a baby in my belly. i wanted to write poems. i had a crazy idea that a woman could write a real novel, the kind that shook the world. i hallucinated that a woman could be a poet, but she would have to be free. i couldn’t imagine that freedom for myself even though i could see it in isla negra when i followed pablo neruda. i could see it in the way he walked. even if he were walking inside a dictatorship, among guns, soldiers and spies, there was nothing between him and his vision. anything he saw, he was able to take into himself–there was no sight, no image, no vision to which he didn’t feel entitled. in his heart, everything–everything–belonged to him. pablo neruda was–more than anything–a poet, and so he was an entitled man. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>i was a woman and entitled to nothing. i had nothing except a husband, a rented house, a set of pots, living room furniture, a frenzy of obligations, credit cards, anxious relatives, too many acquaintances, a gift of future diaper service, two telephones, no time to read, a plastic wrapped cookbook of recipes gleaned from the pages of the new york times, and a hunger, a terrible hunger for the unimaginable, unlimited freedom of being a poet, and a baby in my belly. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>i would have called pablo long distance if i had the courage, if i had the ability to speak spanish fluently, if we had ever talked about real things. but, what would a man know about a baby in the belly? and what did it matter if there were to be one poet more or less in the world when so many in his country were dying? <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>i woke up one morning and thought–i can’t have this child. my husband said, “you’ll have to get a job after it’s born so we can buy a house. you’ll need an advanced degree so you can do something.” i thought, i can’t. i have to write poems. my mother found a crib. someone painted it white. a friend sent a pastel mobile with tame wood animals. i thought about blue curtains, making bedspreads, and abortions. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>pablo was silent. he was walking so far from me, i couldn’t hear him. my husband objected to donating more free medical care to the black panthers. i tried to make dolmades from scratch and located grape leaves preserved in brine at the boys’ market twenty miles away. i organized a write-in campaign for peace to challenge jfk. my husband thought it would be nice to have teatime with the children and romantic dinners by ourselves. the new formula bottles lined up on the sink like tiny bombs. the u.s. was pursuing over ground testing; i was afraid the radiation would cross the milk barrier. i had a poem in me howling for real life but no language to write in. the fog came in thick, flapping about my feet like blankets unraveling. i became afraid to have a daughter. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>i called pablo neruda in the middle of the night as he walked underwater by isla negra. he moved like a dream porpoise. he seemed pregnant with words. they came out of his penis in long miraculous strings. the sea creatures quivered with joy. i said, “pablo, i want to know how to bear the child in my belly onto this bed of uranium and i want to know if a woman can a be a poet.” he was large as a whale. he drank the sea and spouted it in glistening odes, black and shiny. i said, “i can’t have this child,” and he laughed as if he had never done anything but carry and birth children. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>so i packed my little bag as if i were going to the hospital and i left a note and the wearever pots and sterilized nipples upon the glass missiles, and took the cradle board than an american indian friend had given me for the baby and that had made my husband snort– “you’re not going to carry the thing on your back, are you?” i took some money, the car, some books, paper and pens, my walking shoes, an unwieldly ibm electric typewriter, my pregnant belly and a dozen cloth diapers, and i went out. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>i knew how to carry a baby and how to carry a poem and i would learn how to have a baby and even how to have a poem. i would have enough milk for both. i would learn how to walk with them. but i didn’t know, and i didn’t want to know, how to have a husband and a matched set of wearever pots. <line>","living,life choices,parenthood,arts & sciences,poetry & poets,social commentaries,gender & sexuality,history & politics,war & conflict"
11585,12101,"<line> <line>i remember she rented a room on the second floor from jenny holtzerman, an austrian widow. the two women lived on girard avenue south, in kenwood, an elegant suburb of minneapolis. any promise of husbands had disappeared long ago. from the kitchen i often remember the jelly smell of a linzer torte. i was in high school and often i eavesdropped. once, quietly, she said to my mother, “i never knew the love of a man.” she had mentioned having a husband, but during the war they were separated in the chaos of budapest, and later she lost track of him. once she showed me her room: the walls were bare with cracks. her daybed was narrow, barely slept-in. her room resembled hundreds of scant little rooms around the world, the way it accepted blue and purple-violet detail—on her bureau, no family photographs, instead, playbills autographed by cast members, a calendar tattered, crossed, marked, no jewelry, some coins. her window sashes warped, her wires shorted and the paint around her doorframe kept chipping off—“like in the cherry orchard,” she said, “by chekhov.” she told a joke in hungarian to hannah tamasek and even i, not knowing a word, laughed. she bowed gently in a mannerism distinctly viennese and spoke on occasion of the austro-hungarian empire. she loved the guthrie theater, where curtains rose on miniature worlds, preferring memorized dialogue and costumes to something truer. five feet tall in orthopedic shoes, she limped. time has a way of rearranging things and i could have most details wrong now, but there was this: during the war, she met a man, whom she gave money to, she did not know the man well, but had trusted him to smuggle her father across the border, the man pocketed the money, bought chocolates for his mistress from belgium, and placed margaret’s father on a train to auschwitz. so it makes sense to me now that simple decisions baffled margaret. it makes sense to me now that when news reached us of primo levi’s suicide, margaret did not blink. it makes sense to me now that when dr. sikorski spoke of fighting in the warsaw sewers, margaret said, “i do not believe in god.” those who saw what they saw grow fewer. margaret has been dead a long time now. but perhaps you will understand why i chose her, why i have smudged the slow waltz of her smile and added only a few modest blue strokes—here and here. as you leave margaret behind and turn the page, listen as the page falls back and your hand gently buries her. this is what the past sounds like. <line>","living,sorrow & grieving,time & brevity,social commentaries,history & politics,war & conflict"

11614,7114,"<line> <line>st. agnes' eve—ah, bitter chill it was! the owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold; the hare limp'd trembling through the frozen grass, and silent was the flock in woolly fold: numb were the beadsman's fingers, while he told his rosary, and while his frosted breath, like pious incense from a censer old, seem'd taking flight for heaven, without a death, past the sweet virgin's picture, while his prayer he saith. his prayer he saith, this patient, holy man; then takes his lamp, and riseth from his knees, and back returneth, meagre, barefoot, wan, along the chapel aisle by slow degrees: the sculptur'd dead, on each side, seem to freeze, emprison'd in black, purgatorial rails: knights, ladies, praying in dumb orat'ries, he passeth by; and his weak spirit fails to think how they may ache in icy hoods and mails. northward he turneth through a little door, and scarce three steps, ere music's golden tongue flatter'd to tears this aged man and poor; but no—already had his deathbell rung; the joys of all his life were said and sung: his was harsh penance on st. agnes' eve: another way he went, and soon among rough ashes sat he for his soul's reprieve, and all night kept awake, for sinners' sake to grieve. that ancient beadsman heard the prelude soft; and so it chanc'd, for many a door was wide, from hurry to and fro. soon, up aloft, the silver, snarling trumpets 'gan to chide: the level chambers, ready with their pride, were glowing to receive a thousand guests: the carved angels, ever eager-eyed, star'd, where upon their heads the cornice rests, with hair blown back, and wings put cross-wise on their breasts. at length burst in the argent revelry, with plume, tiara, and all rich array, numerous as shadows haunting faerily the brain, new stuff'd, in youth, with triumphs gay of old romance. these let us wish away, and turn, sole-thoughted, to one lady there, whose heart had brooded, all that wintry day, on love, and wing'd st. agnes' saintly care, as she had heard old dames full many times declare. they told her how, upon st. agnes' eve, young virgins might have visions of delight, and soft adorings from their loves receive upon the honey'd middle of the night, if ceremonies due they did aright; as, supperless to bed they must retire, and couch supine their beauties, lily white; nor look behind, nor sideways, but require of heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire. full of this whim was thoughtful madeline: the music, yearning like a god in pain, she scarcely heard: her maiden eyes divine, fix'd on the floor, saw many a sweeping train pass by—she heeded not at all: in vain came many a tiptoe, amorous cavalier, and back retir'd; not cool'd by high disdain, but she saw not: her heart was otherwhere: she sigh'd for agnes' dreams, the sweetest of the year. she danc'd along with vague, regardless eyes, anxious her lips, her breathing quick and short: the hallow'd hour was near at hand: she sighs amid the timbrels, and the throng'd resort of whisperers in anger, or in sport; 'mid looks of love, defiance, hate, and scorn, hoodwink'd with faery fancy; all amort, save to st. agnes and her lambs unshorn, and all the bliss to be before to-morrow morn. so, purposing each moment to retire, she linger'd still. meantime, across the moors, had come young porphyro, with heart on fire for madeline. beside the portal doors, buttress'd from moonlight, stands he, and implores all saints to give him sight of madeline, but for one moment in the tedious hours, that he might gaze and worship all unseen; perchance speak, kneel, touch, kiss—in sooth such things have been. he ventures in: let no buzz'd whisper tell: all eyes be muffled, or a hundred swords will storm his heart, love's fev'rous citadel: for him, those chambers held barbarian hordes, hyena foemen, and hot-blooded lords, whose very dogs would execrations howl against his lineage: not one breast affords him any mercy, in that mansion foul, save one old beldame, weak in body and in soul. ah, happy chance! the aged creature came, shuffling along with ivory-headed wand, to where he stood, hid from the torch's flame, behind a broad half-pillar, far beyond the sound of merriment and chorus bland: he startled her; but soon she knew his face, and grasp'd his fingers in her palsied hand, saying, ""mercy, porphyro! hie thee from this place; they are all here to-night, the whole blood-thirsty race! ""get hence! get hence! there's dwarfish hildebrand; he had a fever late, and in the fit he cursed thee and thine, both house and land: then there's that old lord maurice, not a whit more tame for his gray hairs—alas me! flit! flit like a ghost away.""—""ah, gossip dear, we're safe enough; here in this arm-chair sit, and tell me how""—""good saints! not here, not here; follow me, child, or else these stones will be thy bier."" he follow'd through a lowly arched way, brushing the cobwebs with his lofty plume, and as she mutter'd ""well-a—well-a-day!"" he found him in a little moonlight room, pale, lattic'd, chill, and silent as a tomb. ""now tell me where is madeline,"" said he, ""o tell me, angela, by the holy loom which none but secret sisterhood may see, when they st. agnes' wool are weaving piously."" ""st. agnes! ah! it is st. agnes' eve— yet men will murder upon holy days: thou must hold water in a witch's sieve, and be liege-lord of all the elves and fays, to venture so: it fills me with amaze to see thee, porphyro!—st. agnes' eve! god's help! my lady fair the conjuror plays this very night: good angels her deceive! but let me laugh awhile, i've mickle time to grieve."" feebly she laugheth in the languid moon, while porphyro upon her face doth look, like puzzled urchin on an aged crone who keepeth clos'd a wond'rous riddle-book, as spectacled she sits in chimney nook. but soon his eyes grew brilliant, when she told his lady's purpose; and he scarce could brook tears, at the thought of those enchantments cold, and madeline asleep in lap of legends old. sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose, flushing his brow, and in his pained heart made purple riot: then doth he propose a stratagem, that makes the beldame start: ""a cruel man and impious thou art: sweet lady, let her pray, and sleep, and dream alone with her good angels, far apart from wicked men like thee. go, go!—i deem thou canst not surely be the same that thou didst seem."" ""i will not harm her, by all saints i swear,"" quoth porphyro: ""o may i ne'er find grace when my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer, if one of her soft ringlets i displace, or look with ruffian passion in her face: good angela, believe me by these tears; or i will, even in a moment's space, awake, with horrid shout, my foemen's ears, and beard them, though they be more fang'd than wolves and bears."" ""ah! why wilt thou affright a feeble soul? a poor, weak, palsy-stricken, churchyard thing, whose passing-bell may ere the midnight toll; whose prayers for thee, each morn and evening, were never miss'd.""—thus plaining, doth she bring a gentler speech from burning porphyro; so woful, and of such deep sorrowing, that angela gives promise she will do whatever he shall wish, betide her weal or woe. which was, to lead him, in close secrecy, even to madeline's chamber, and there hide him in a closet, of such privacy that he might see her beauty unespy'd, and win perhaps that night a peerless bride, while legion'd faeries pac'd the coverlet, and pale enchantment held her sleepy-ey'd. never on such a night have lovers met, since merlin paid his demon all the monstrous debt. ""it shall be as thou wishest,"" said the dame: ""all cates and dainties shall be stored there quickly on this feast-night: by the tambour frame her own lute thou wilt see: no time to spare, for i am slow and feeble, and scarce dare on such a catering trust my dizzy head. wait here, my child, with patience; kneel in prayer the while: ah! thou must needs the lady wed, or may i never leave my grave among the dead."" so saying, she hobbled off with busy fear. the lover's endless minutes slowly pass'd; the dame return'd, and whisper'd in his ear to follow her; with aged eyes aghast from fright of dim espial. safe at last, through many a dusky gallery, they gain the maiden's chamber, silken, hush'd, and chaste; where porphyro took covert, pleas'd amain. his poor guide hurried back with agues in her brain. her falt'ring hand upon the balustrade, old angela was feeling for the stair, when madeline, st. agnes' charmed maid, rose, like a mission'd spirit, unaware: with silver taper's light, and pious care, she turn'd, and down the aged gossip led to a safe level matting. now prepare, young porphyro, for gazing on that bed; she comes, she comes again, like ring-dove fray'd and fled. out went the taper as she hurried in; its little smoke, in pallid moonshine, died: she clos'd the door, she panted, all akin to spirits of the air, and visions wide: no uttered syllable, or, woe betide! but to her heart, her heart was voluble, paining with eloquence her balmy side; as though a tongueless nightingale should swell her throat in vain, and die, heart-stifled, in her dell. a casement high and triple-arch'd there was, all garlanded with carven imag'ries of fruits, and flowers, and bunches of knot-grass, and diamonded with panes of quaint device, innumerable of stains and splendid dyes, as are the tiger-moth's deep-damask'd wings; and in the midst, 'mong thousand heraldries, and twilight saints, and dim emblazonings, a shielded scutcheon blush'd with blood of queens and kings. full on this casement shone the wintry moon, and threw warm gules on madeline's fair breast, as down she knelt for heaven's grace and boon; rose-bloom fell on her hands, together prest, and on her silver cross soft amethyst, and on her hair a glory, like a saint: she seem'd a splendid angel, newly drest, save wings, for heaven:—porphyro grew faint: she knelt, so pure a thing, so free from mortal taint. anon his heart revives: her vespers done, of all its wreathed pearls her hair she frees; unclasps her warmed jewels one by one; loosens her fragrant boddice; by degrees her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees: half-hidden, like a mermaid in sea-weed, pensive awhile she dreams awake, and sees, in fancy, fair st. agnes in her bed, but dares not look behind, or all the charm is fled. soon, trembling in her soft and chilly nest, in sort of wakeful swoon, perplex'd she lay, until the poppied warmth of sleep oppress'd her soothed limbs, and soul fatigued away; flown, like a thought, until the morrow-day; blissfully haven'd both from joy and pain; clasp'd like a missal where swart paynims pray; blinded alike from sunshine and from rain, as though a rose should shut, and be a bud again. stol'n to this paradise, and so entranced, porphyro gaz'd upon her empty dress, and listen'd to her breathing, if it chanced to wake into a slumberous tenderness; which when he heard, that minute did he bless, and breath'd himself: then from the closet crept, noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness, and over the hush'd carpet, silent, stept, and 'tween the curtains peep'd, where, lo!—how fast she slept. then by the bed-side, where the faded moon made a dim, silver twilight, soft he set a table, and, half anguish'd, threw thereon a cloth of woven crimson, gold, and jet:— o for some drowsy morphean amulet! the boisterous, midnight, festive clarion, the kettle-drum, and far-heard clarinet, affray his ears, though but in dying tone:— the hall door shuts again, and all the noise is gone. and still she slept an azure-lidded sleep, in blanched linen, smooth, and lavender'd, while he forth from the closet brought a heap of candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd; with jellies soother than the creamy curd, and lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon; manna and dates, in argosy transferr'd from fez; and spiced dainties, every one, from silken samarcand to cedar'd lebanon. these delicates he heap'd with glowing hand on golden dishes and in baskets bright of wreathed silver: sumptuous they stand in the retired quiet of the night, filling the chilly room with perfume light.— ""and now, my love, my seraph fair, awake! thou art my heaven, and i thine eremite: open thine eyes, for meek st. agnes' sake, or i shall drowse beside thee, so my soul doth ache."" thus whispering, his warm, unnerved arm sank in her pillow. shaded was her dream by the dusk curtains:—'twas a midnight charm impossible to melt as iced stream: the lustrous salvers in the moonlight gleam; broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies: it seem'd he never, never could redeem from such a stedfast spell his lady's eyes; so mus'd awhile, entoil'd in woofed phantasies. awakening up, he took her hollow lute,— tumultuous,—and, in chords that tenderest be, he play'd an ancient ditty, long since mute, in provence call'd, ""la belle dame sans mercy"": close to her ear touching the melody;— wherewith disturb'd, she utter'd a soft moan: he ceas'd—she panted quick—and suddenly her blue affrayed eyes wide open shone: upon his knees he sank, pale as smooth-sculptured stone. her eyes were open, but she still beheld, now wide awake, the vision of her sleep: there was a painful change, that nigh expell'd the blisses of her dream so pure and deep at which fair madeline began to weep, and moan forth witless words with many a sigh; while still her gaze on porphyro would keep; who knelt, with joined hands and piteous eye, fearing to move or speak, she look'd so dreamingly. ""ah, porphyro!"" said she, ""but even now thy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear, made tuneable with every sweetest vow; and those sad eyes were spiritual and clear: how chang'd thou art! how pallid, chill, and drear! give me that voice again, my porphyro, those looks immortal, those complainings dear! oh leave me not in this eternal woe, for if thy diest, my love, i know not where to go."" beyond a mortal man impassion'd far at these voluptuous accents, he arose ethereal, flush'd, and like a throbbing star seen mid the sapphire heaven's deep repose; into her dream he melted, as the rose blendeth its odour with the violet,— solution sweet: meantime the frost-wind blows like love's alarum pattering the sharp sleet against the window-panes; st. agnes' moon hath set. 'tis dark: quick pattereth the flaw-blown sleet: ""this is no dream, my bride, my madeline!"" 'tis dark: the iced gusts still rave and beat: ""no dream, alas! alas! and woe is mine! porphyro will leave me here to fade and pine.— cruel! what traitor could thee hither bring? i curse not, for my heart is lost in thine, though thou forsakest a deceived thing;— a dove forlorn and lost with sick unpruned wing."" ""my madeline! sweet dreamer! lovely bride! say, may i be for aye thy vassal blest? thy beauty's shield, heart-shap'd and vermeil dyed? ah, silver shrine, here will i take my rest after so many hours of toil and quest, a famish'd pilgrim,—sav'd by miracle. though i have found, i will not rob thy nest saving of thy sweet self; if thou think'st well to trust, fair madeline, to no rude infidel. ""hark! 'tis an elfin-storm from faery land, of haggard seeming, but a boon indeed: arise—arise! the morning is at hand;— the bloated wassaillers will never heed:— let us away, my love, with happy speed; there are no ears to hear, or eyes to see,— drown'd all in rhenish and the sleepy mead: awake! arise! my love, and fearless be, for o'er the southern moors i have a home for thee."" she hurried at his words, beset with fears, for there were sleeping dragons all around, at glaring watch, perhaps, with ready spears— down the wide stairs a darkling way they found.— in all the house was heard no human sound. a chain-droop'd lamp was flickering by each door; the arras, rich with horseman, hawk, and hound, flutter'd in the besieging wind's uproar; and the long carpets rose along the gusty floor. they glide, like phantoms, into the wide hall; like phantoms, to the iron porch, they glide; where lay the porter, in uneasy sprawl, with a huge empty flaggon by his side: the wakeful bloodhound rose, and shook his hide, but his sagacious eye an inmate owns: by one, and one, the bolts full easy slide:— the chains lie silent on the footworn stones;— the key turns, and the door upon its hinges groans. and they are gone: ay, ages long ago these lovers fled away into the storm. that night the baron dreamt of many a woe, and all his warrior-guests, with shade and form of witch, and demon, and large coffin-worm, were long be-nightmar'd. angela the old died palsy-twitch'd, with meagre face deform; the beadsman, after thousand aves told, for aye unsought for slept among his ashes cold. <line>","living,death,marriage & companionship,love,first love,infatuation & crushes,romantic love,relationships,men & women,religion,christianity,mythology & folklore,ghosts & the supernatural"

11662,898,"<line> <line>hamelin town's in brunswick, by famous hanover city; the river weser, deep and wide, washes its wall on the southern side; a pleasanter spot you never spied; but, when begins my ditty, almost five hundred years ago, to see the townsfolk suffer so from vermin, was a pity. rats! they fought the dogs, and killed the cats, and bit the babies in the cradles, and eat the cheeses out of the vats, and licked the soup from the cooks' own ladles, split open the kegs of salted sprats, made nests inside men's sunday hats, and even spoiled the women's chats by drowning their speaking with shrieking and squeaking in fifty different sharps and flats. at last the people in a body to the town hall came flocking: 'tis clear, cried they, our mayor's a noddy; and as for our corporation — shocking to think we buy gowns lined with ermine for dolts that can't or won't determine what's like to rid us of our vermin! rouse up, sirs! give your brains a racking to find the remedy we're lacking, or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing! at this the mayor and corporation quaked with a mighty consternation. an hour they sate in council, at length the mayor broke silence: for a guilder i'd my ermine gown sell; i wish i were a mile hence! it's easy to bid one rack one's brain — i'm sure my poor head aches again i've scratched it so, and all in vain. oh for a trap, a trap, a trap! just as he said this, what should hap at the chamber door but a gentle tap? bless us, cried the mayor, what's that? (with the corporation as he sate, looking little though wondrous fat); only a scraping of shoes on the mat? anything like the sound of a rat makes my heart go pit-a-pat! come in! — the mayor cried, looking bigger: and in did come the strangest figure! his queer long coat from heel to head was half of yellow and half of red; and he himself was tall and thin, with sharp blue eyes, each like a pin, and light loose hair, yet swarthy skin, no tuft on cheek nor beard on chin, but lips where smiles went out and in — there was no guessing his kith and kin! and nobody could enough admire the tall man and his quaint attire: quoth one: it's as my great-grandsire, starting up at the trump of doom's tone, had walked this way from his painted tombstone! he advanced to the council-table: and, please your honours, said he, i'm able, by means of a secret charm, to draw all creatures living beneath the sun, that creep, or swim, or fly, or run, after me so as you never saw! and i chiefly use my charm on creatures that do people harm, the mole, and toad, and newt, and viper; and people call me the pied piper. (and here they noticed round his neck a scarf of red and yellow stripe, to match with his coat of the self-same cheque; and at the scarf's end hung a pipe; and his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying as if impatient to be playing upon this pipe, as low it dangled over his vesture so old-fangled.) yet, said he, poor piper as i am, in tartary i freed the cham, last june, from his huge swarms of gnats; i eased in asia the nizam of a monstrous brood of vampyre-bats: and, as for what your brain bewilders, if i can rid your town of rats will you give me a thousand guilders? one? fifty thousand! — was the exclamation of the astonished mayor and corporation. into the street the piper stept, smiling first a little smile, as if he knew what magic slept in his quiet pipe the while; then, like a musical adept, to blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled, and green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled, like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled; and ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered, you heard as if an army muttered; and the muttering grew to a grumbling; and the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling; and out of the houses the rats came tumbling. great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats, brown rats, black rats, grey rats, tawny rats, grave old plodders, gay young friskers, fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins, cocking tails and pricking whiskers, families by tens and dozens, brothers, sisters, husbands, wives — followed the piper for their lives. from street to street he piped advancing, and step for step they followed dancing, until they came to the river weser wherein all plunged and perished — save one who, stout as julius caesar, swam across and lived to carry (as he the manuscript he cherished) to rat-land home his commentary, which was, at the first shrill notes of the pipe, i heard a sound as of scraping tripe, and putting apples, wondrous ripe, into a cider-press's gripe: and a moving away of pickle-tub-boards, and a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards, and a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks, and a breaking the hoops of butter-casks; and it seemed as if a voice (sweeter than by harp or by psaltery is breathed) called out, oh rats, rejoice! the world is grown to one vast drysaltery! 'so munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon, 'breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon! and just as one bulky sugar-puncheon, ready staved, like a great sun shone glorious scarce an inch before me, just as methought it said, come, bore me! — i found the weser rolling o'er me. you should have heard the hamelin people ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple; go, cried the mayor, and get long poles! poke out the nests and block up the holes! consult with carpenters and builders, and leave in our town not even a trace of the rats! — when suddenly up the face of the piper perked in the market-place, with a, first, if you please, my thousand guilders! a thousand guilders! the mayor looked blue; so did the corporation too. for council dinners made rare havock with claret, moselle, vin-de-grave, hock; and half the money would replenish their cellar's biggest butt with rhenish. to pay this sum to a wandering fellow with a gipsy coat of red and yellow! beside, quoth the mayor with a knowing wink, our business was done at the river's brink; we saw with our eyes the vermin sink, and what's dead can't come to life, i think. so, friend, we're not the folks to shrink from the duty of giving you something for drink, and a matter of money to put in your poke; but, as for the guilders, what we spoke of them, as you very well know, was in joke. beside, our losses have made us thrifty; a thousand guilders! come, take fifty! the piper's face fell, and he cried, no trifling! i can't wait, beside! i've promised to visit by dinner time bagdat, and accept the prime of the head cook's pottage, all he's rich in, for having left, in the caliph's kitchen, of a nest of scorpions no survivor — with him i proved no bargain-driver, with you, don't think i'll bate a stiver! and folks who put me in a passion may find me pipe after another fashion. how? cried the mayor, d'ye think i'll brook being worse treated than a cook? insulted by a lazy ribald with idle pipe and vesture piebald? you threaten us, fellow? do your worst, blow your pipe there till you burst! once more he stept into the street; and to his lips again laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane; and ere he blew three notes (such sweet soft notes as yet musician's cunning never gave th'enraptured air) there was a rustling, that seem'd like a bustling of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling, small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering, little hands clapping, and little tongues chattering, and, like fowls in a farm-yard when barley is scattering, out came the children running. all the little boys and girls, with rosy cheeks and flaxen curls, and sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls, tripping and skipping, ran merrily after the wonderful music with shouting and laughter. the mayor was dumb, and the council stood as if they were changed into blocks of wood, unable to move a step, or cry to the children merrily skipping by — could only follow with the eye that joyous crowd at the piper's back. but how the mayor was on the rack, and the wretched council's bosoms beat, as the piper turned from the high street to where the weser rolled its waters right in the way of their sons and daughters! however he turned from south to west, and to coppelburg hill his steps addressed, and after him the children pressed; great was the joy in every breast. he never can cross that mighty top! he's forced to let the piping drop, and we shall see our children stop! when, lo, as they reached the mountain's side, a wondrous portal opened wide, as if a cavern was suddenly hollowed; and the piper advanced and the children follow'd, and when all were in to the very last, the door in the mountain side shut fast. did i say, all? no! one was lame, and could not dance the whole of the way; and in after years, if you would blame his sadness, he was used to say, — it's dull in our town since my playmates left! i can't forget that i'm bereft of all the pleasant sights they see, which the piper also promised me; for he led us, he said, to a joyous land, joining the town and just at hand, where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew, and flowers put forth a fairer hue, and every thing was strange and new; the sparrows were brighter than peacocks here, and their dogs outran our fallow deer, and honey-bees had lost their stings, and horses were born with eagles' wings: and just as i felt assured my lame foot would be speedily cured, the music stopped and i stood still, and found myself outside the hill, left alone against my will, to go now limping as before, and never hear of that country more! alas, alas for hamelin! there came into many a burgher's pate a text which says, that heaven's gate opes to the rich at as easy a rate as the needle's eye takes a camel in! the mayor sent east, west, north, and south, to offer the piper, by word of mouth, wherever it was men's lot to find him, silver and gold to his heart's content, if he'd only return the way he went, and bring the children behind him. but when they saw 'twas a lost endeavour, and piper and dancers were gone for ever, they made a decree that lawyers never should think their records dated duly if, after the day of the month and year, these words did not as well appear, ""and so long after what happened here ""on the twenty-second of july, ""thirteen hundred and seventy-six:"" and the better in memory to fix the place of the children's last retreat, they called it, the pied piper's street — where any one playing on pipe or tabor was sure for the future to lose his labour. nor suffered they hostelry or tavern to shock with mirth a street so solemn; but opposite the place of the cavern they wrote the story on a column, and on the great church window painted the same, to make the world acquainted how their children were stolen away; and there it stands to this very day. and i must not omit to say that in transylvania there's a tribe of alien people who ascribe the outlandish ways and dress on which their neighbours lay such stress to their fathers and mothers having risen out of some subterraneous prison into which they were trepanned long time ago in a mighty band out of hamelin town in brunswick land, but how or why, they don't understand. so, willy, let you and me be wipers of scores out with all men — especially pipers: and, whether they pipe us from rats or from mice, if we've promised them aught, let us keep our promise. <line>","arts & sciences,music,social commentaries,mythology & folklore"

11731,5834,"<line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>sonnet 19 (on his blindness) by john milton <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>1. spent <line> <line> <line> <line>in sonnet 19, milton makes the seemingly deliberate choice to avoid “the” and “a” — respectively, the most common and the sixth most common words in english usage. instead of these articles — definite and indefinite — the poem stages a territorial dispute between possessives: the octave is “my” land, the sestet is “his” land, with the occasional “this” or “that” flagging no man’s land. we come to understand milton’s mistake — the professed regret of the poem — as this act of claiming. it is only through his taking possession that the universal light is divided up, apportioned into “my light” — a finite commodity that by being subjected to ownership becomes capable of being “spent.” <line> <line>“spent” — a word like a flapping sack.my mistake was similar. i came to consider my body — its tug-of-war of tautnesses and slacknesses — to be entirely my own, an appliance for generating various textures and temperatures of friction. should i have known, then, that by this act of self-claiming, i was cutting myself off from the eternal, the infinite, that i had fashioned myself into a resource that was bounded and, therefore, exhaustible? <line> <line>2. wide <line> <line>the “wide” is always haunted by surprise. in a dark world, the “wide” is the sudden door that opens on unfurling blackness, the void pooling at the bottom of the unlit stairs. to be bounded is our usual condition; to be open is anomalous, even excessive. <line> <line> <line> <line>a wide-eyed girl is extreme in her unliddedness, her bare membranes flinching at any contact, vulnerable to motes, to smuts, to dryness. a wide-hipped girl extends the splayed arches of her body to bridge the generational divide. a wide-legged girl unseals a portal between persons; she is disturbing to the extent that she is open to all comers, a trapdoor that must be shut for safety’s sake. a wide-eyed girl is often thought desirable; a wide-hipped girl is often thought eligible; a wide-legged girl is often thought deplorable. a wide-legged girl is rarely wide-eyed, though she may have started out that way. <line> <line> <line> <line>we can understand why milton, in the narrowing orbit of his blindness, would have considered wideness, unboundedness to be threatening. what’s less clear is why the wideness of the wide-legged girl is also considered threatening. does the wideness of the wide-legged girl evoke a kind of blindness, a dark room where one might blunder into strangers, the way two men once met each other in me? <line> <line>3. hide <line> <line>“but why hide it in a hole?” asks the master, returning from his long absence, sparks of bewilderment flaring into rage. <line> <line> <line> <line>an unanswered question worries at the parable of the talents: why is the master so terribly angry? it is not as if the servant had stolen the money, or spent it—his sin is one of omission, of overly risk-averse investing. a talent was a unit of weight in ancient greece: in monetary terms, it was worth eighty pounds of silver, or 6,000 denarii—nearly twenty years’ wages for the average worker. but milton uses the word in its more modern sense, dating from the fifteenth century: a natural ability or skill. <line> <line> <line> <line>how did a word for a deadweight of metal come to mean something inborn, innate? confusion between the inorganic and the natural trickles into the parable and the poem. the master prides himself on being a man who reaps where he has not sown and gathers where he did not scatter seed. was the servant’s fault to confuse coins for seeds, did he think he was planting when he was merely burying, did he mistake for viable what had no chance of living, what had never been alive? <line> <line>4. bent <line> <line>and what about the hole, which for so long had held treasure? did it wonder why — despite all the moistness and richness it could muster — those cold, glinting seeds never sprouted? did it understand that, if released into the wider world, the coins could have quickened, multiplied? that instead of an incubator, the hole had become an oubliette, a place where otherwise fruitful things were sent to languish, to become lodged, useless? <line> <line> <line> <line>“useless” — a word like a capped lead pipe, like the extra bone in my foot i will never pass down to my daughter. <line> <line> <line> <line>a thing becomes useless if it is bent out of shape. to “get bent” is to be put to another kind of use, a use my therapist considered tantamount to rape. to bend is to be bound, to bow down without breaking, with perhaps just the head tilted at an angle so as to peer upward. <line> <line>5. present <line> <line>the master has become the maker. the servile body wholly “his,” splayed wide in a welcome-home, bound up in a beribboned bow. <line> <line> <line> <line>but the reader will object. this is all wrong. first of all, in the sonnet, “bent” doesn’t mean to bow down as if in submission to an outside force, but instead denotes an innate or internalized tendency or inclination. second, a “present” is not a gift, but a verb meaning to offer openly, full-faced, the sun beaming down on a clean page. third, the body never comes into it at all. <line> <line>“therewith” — a safe word, a strongbox to be buried.6. chide <line> <line>is a “true account” a story or a sum? is the maker an audience or an auditor? <line> <line> <line> <line>the page scoured white by little grains of fear. <line> <line> <line> <line>a story has an ending. a sum has a bottom line. there was no accounting for me because my allotment leaked out of me, month after month, i scrubbed the sheets as if effacing the marks of a crime. <line> <line> <line> <line>then one day the fear reversed itself. like a photo negative but in higher contrast—its whites more glaring and its darks more glossy, as if a whisper-thin suspicion had come unzipped. <line> <line> <line> <line>“chide” is an enormous understatement. the servant isn’t merely scolded, he is cast into “the outer darkness” where there is “weeping and gnashing of teeth.” if the “outer darkness” is deemed to be a punishment, then does that lustrous inner darkness count as a reward? <line> <line>7. denied <line> <line>it seems unfair, is milton’s point. to be assigned a task, but not provided sufficient materials to complete it, is to be placed in a situation of contrived scarcity, like a lab rat or like the youngest sister in a fairy tale. <line> <line> <line> <line>the parable of the wise and foolish virgins—which prefaces the parable of the talents — centers on this scarcity. the virgins wait for the bridegroom, to greet him with lamps alight. five virgins have brought extra flasks of oil, but five virgins have let their lamps burn out and must go lampless into the night to look for oil. that much we are told, but questions hover around the shadowed margins of the story. why isn’t the bridegroom with the bride? why is he so delayed? why is the bridegroom met in the middle of the night by a phalanx of lamp-bearing virgins, like a troupe of pom-pom girls or like a sacrificial rite? <line> <line> <line> <line>the virginity of the virgins renders them piquant, memorable. adorning gothic portals, evoking thresholds, entrances, they are a particular feature of french cathedrals—much more so, one suspects, than if the parable had called them “maidservants” or even “bridesmaids.” <line> <line> <line> <line>the presumed desideratum of the story does not interest us much: the sated bridegroom at the midnight feast, the smug, unctuous faces of the wise virgins. instead, the imagination pursues the foolish virgins rushing into the night, their desperation making them vulnerable, their vulnerability making them erotic, the fill-holes of their useless lamps dark and slick with oil. is this how i was taught to sexualize insufficiency, the lack that set me wandering night after night, my body too early emptied out? <line> <line>8. prevent <line> <line>“prevent” — a word like a white sheet folded back to cover the mouth. <line> <line> <line> <line>a white egg bursts from the ovary and falls away, leaving a star-shaped scar. corpus albicans, the whitening body. such starbursts, at first, are scattered constellations, frost embroidering a dark field. but at what point does this white lacework shift over from intricacy to impossibility, opacity, obstacle—the ice disc clogging the round pond, the grid of proteins baffling the eye? <line> <line> <line> <line>“prevent” — a word that slams shut, a portcullis (latin: cataracta). <line> <line> <line> <line>letter to leonard philaras, september 28, 1654: “the dimness which i experience by night and day, seems to incline more to white than to black.” <line> <line>9. need <line> <line>has patience been looming in the background all along, silent, so as not to intrude upon a blind man’s consciousness? patience, whose garment is “white and close-fitting so that it is not blown about or disturbed by the wind.” <line> <line> <line> <line>at the turn of the sonnet, patience pries open its sculpted lips, its stiff tongue like a weaver’s shuttle drawing woolly strands through the warp and weft of milton’s blindness, a white monologue that admits neither interruption nor rejoinder. <line> <line> <line> <line>milton’s little murmur stitched back into his mouth. <line> <line> <line> <line>woven tight enough to repel need — a liquid beading on the surface, the blood the needles drew from me week after week, hundreds of stoppered vials consigned to the biohazard bin, en route to the incinerator. <line> <line> <line> <line>“need,” from the high german, for danger. <line> <line> <line> <line>“murmur,” from the sanskrit, a crackling fire. <line> <line>10. best <line> <line>the best beam in contentment, ranging themselves in rows. erect as test tubes but forswearing undue pride in such uprightness, mustering shoulder-to-shoulder with the fellow-elect. the best arrayed in regimental ranks, in refrigerated racks, white hymn of the unneeded, white hum of the unneeding. <line> <line> <line> <line>“best,” originally superlative of bot (old english: remedy, reparation). <line> <line> <line> <line>the best affect a pious pose, mouths held taut in tongueless os. sotto voce chorus of that soft, subjunctive song: if you were complete ... if you were replete ... <line> <line> <line> <line>superlative. the most remediated. the most repaired. <line> <line>11. state <line> <line>to be scooped out, emptied of need and rinsed clean of its greasy smears, pristine as a petri dish on a stainless lab table. enucleated, the white of the egg awaiting an unknown yolk. <line> <line> <line> <line>“yolk” from geolu (old english: yellow). not to be confused with “yoke” from geocian (old english: to be joined together). a yoke is an implement, meant to be used, to fill a need. but where there is no field to be plowed, no wagon to be pulled, why demand a yoke that is useless, needless? <line> <line> <line> <line>one day the romans sent for cincinnatus to lead the republic against the invading aequian army. he laid down his plow in the field and went to war. when the aequians surrendered, cincinnatus spared their lives but decreed that they must “pass under the yoke.” the romans fashioned a yoke from three spears, two fixed in the ground, and one tied across the tops of the two verticals. since the horizontal spear was only a few feet off the ground, the aequians were made to crouch down like animals in order to complete the surrender. this is thought to be the origin of the word “subjugate,” to be brought under the yoke. to bear a yoke is to be bowed down, oxbowed, cowed. <line> <line> <line> <line>one day they laid me down on a gurney, my feet strapped in stirrups, my legs bent and splayed like the horns of a white bull. <line> <line>12. speed <line> <line>but why would milton, of all people, use the word “kingly” as a compliment?

<line> <line>which is to say this very moment. <line> <line>and yet the promise of a distant <line> <line>purpose is what makes each moment new. <line> <line>there may be nothing for the soul to say <line> <line>in its defense, except to describe the way <line> <line>it came to find itself at the impasse <line> <line>morning reveals in the glass— <line> <line>the road that led away from home to here, <line> <line>that began in wonderment and hope, <line> <line>but that ended in the long slope <line> <line>down to loneliness and the fear of fear. <line> <line>the casuistry is all in the event, <line> <line>contingent on what someone might have meant <line> <line>or might still mean. what feels most frightening <line> <line>is the thought that when the lightning <line> <line>has subsided, and the clearing sky <line> <line>appears at last above the stage <line> <line>to mark the only end of age, <line> <line>that god, that distant and unseeing eye, <line> <line>would see that none of this had ever been: <line> <line>that none of it, apparent or unseen, <line> <line>was ever real, and all the private words, <line> <line>which seemed to fill the air like birds <line> <line>exploding from the brush, were merely sounds <line> <line>without significance or sense, <line> <line>inert and dead beneath the dense <line> <line>expanse of the earth in its impassive rounds. <line> <line>there may be no rejoinder to that thought. <line> <line>there may be nothing that one could have sought <line> <line>that might have lent the search significance, <line> <line>or even a kind of coherence. <line> <line>perhaps. yet closer to me than the grandeur <line> <line>of the vast and the uncreated <line> <line>is the calm of this belated <line> <line>moment in its transitory splendor. <line> <line> iii <line> <line>someone asked about the aura of regret <line> <line>and disappointment that surrounds these poems, <line> <line>about the private facts those feelings might conceal, <line> <line>and what their source was in my life. <line> <line>i said that none of it was personal, <line> <line>that as lives go my own life was a settled one, <line> <line>comprising both successes and misfortunes, the successes <line> <line>not especially striking, the misfortunes small. <line> <line>and yet the question is a real one, <line> <line>and not for me alone, though certainly for me. <line> <line>for even if, as wittgenstein once claimed, <line> <line>that while the facts may stay the same <line> <line>and what is true of one is true of both, <line> <line>the happy and unhappy man inhabit different worlds, <line> <line>one still would want to know which world this is, <line> <line>and how that other one could seem so close. <line> <line>so much of how life feels lies in the phrasing, <line> <line>in the way a thought starts, then turns back upon itself <line> <line>until its question hangs unanswered in the breeze. <line> <line>perhaps the sadness is a way of seeming free, <line> <line>of denying what can change or disappear, <line> <line>of tearing free from circumstance, <line> <line>as though the soul could only speak out from the <line> <line>safety of some private chamber in the air. <line> <line>let me try once more. i think the saddest moments <line> <line>are the ones that also seem most beautiful, <line> <line>for the nature of a moment is to fade, <line> <line>leaving everything unaltered, and the landscape <line> <line>where the light fell as it was before. <line> <line>and time makes poetry from what it takes away, <line> <line>and the measure of experience <line> <line>is not that it be real, but that it last, <line> <line>and what one knows is simply what one knew, <line> <line>and what i want is simply what i had. <line> <line>these are the premises that structure what i feel, <line> <line>the axioms that govern my imagination, <line> <line>and beneath them lies the fear— <line> <line>not the fear of the unknown, but the fear of growing old <line> <line>unchanged, of looking in the mirror <line> <line>at a future that repeats itself ad infinitum. <line> <line>it could be otherwise so easily. <line> <line>the transience that lectures so insistently of loss <line> <line>could speak as clearly of an openness renewed, <line> <line>a life made sweeter by its changing; <line> <line>and the shadows of the past <line> <line>could seem a shade where one could linger for a while <line> <line>before returning to the world, and moving on. <line> <line>the way would be the same in either case, <line> <line>extending for an unknown span of years <line> <line>experienced from two perspectives, a familiar course <line> <line>accessible to all, yet narrowing, <line> <line>as the journey nears its end, to one. <line> <line>the difference isn’t in the details <line> <line>or the destination, but in how things feel along the road: <line> <line>the secret of the quest lies all around me, <line> <line>while what lurks below the surface is another story, <line> <line>one of no more consequence or import than the last. <line> <line>what matters isn’t what one chances to believe, <line> <line>but the force of one’s attachments, <line> <line>and instead of looking for an answer in a dream <line> <line>set aside the question, let the songs continue <line> <line>going through the motions of the days <line> <line>and waking every morning to this single world, <line> <line>whether in regret, or in celebration. <line> <line> iv <line> <line>each day begins as yesterday began: <line> <line>a cat in silhouette in the dim light <line> <line>of what the morning holds— <line> <line>breakfast and the new york times, a man <line> <line>taking a shower, a poem taking flight <line> <line>as a state of mind unfolds <line> <line>so unpredictably. <line> <line>through the hot summer air <line> <line>i walk to a building where <line> <line>i give a lecture on philosophy <line> <line>in the strict sense;

what stays <line> <line>is part of an abiding presence, human and serene. <line> <line>the houses wait unquestioning in the light <line> <line>of an approaching summer evening, while a vast <line> <line>contentment answers from the air. <line> <line>i think i know where this is going to end, <line> <line>but still my pleasure is to wait— <line> <line>not wait, perhaps, for anything within, <line> <line>but for what lies outside. let’s see what happens. <line>","living,time & brevity,arts & sciences,philosophy,poetry & poets"

did she wander from the way that we were going? did she fall back, having to rest some place back there, and so we left her? i did not know. i never saw her again, and as we went, i never turned to look behind, and never thought of her until we reached the mound and ceres’ ancient place. when all of us, at last, had gotten there, we all were there, but she had vanished and she wasn’t there. gone from her people, gone from her child, and her husband. what men or gods in my frenzy did i not cry out against? what worse sight had i seen? i left ascanius and anchises and the household gods in the care of my companions and i found a secluded place deep in a valley for them to hide, and i myself took up my shining weapons and sought the city again, determined, no matter what, to look for my creüsa everywhere in troy. i find my way along the walls and to, and through, the shadowed gate i’d left the city by; carefully, step by unseen step, in the dark, backwards the way i came i make my way; everywhere as i go fills me with terror; the very silence around me fills me with terror. i make my way to my home in case, in case, she’s gone back there. the greeks had invaded the house and set it on fire, and through the house the fire rolled up on the surge of the wind to the very roof, and the flames tower high above the burning house and the heat of the burning pours up into the sky. and so i go on, and once again i see the palace of priam, and the citadel, and in the empty courtyard of juno’s shrine there’s phoenix and dire ulysses, guarding the treasures taken from everywhere from the shrines that the greeks had set fire to; the golden bowls, the holy altar-tables, the stolen holy vestments; boys and trembling matrons stand around . . . i wander in the streets, in my desperation calling out her name, creüsa, creüsa, calling creüsa, over and over again. and as i went among the ruined buildings and through the streets of the ruined city, lo, suddenly there rose before my eyes the strangely magnified image of my wife. i was stupefied; my hair stood on end; my voice got caught in my throat. then she spoke to me and said words that altered everything for me: “beloved husband, what use is it for you to persist in this insanity of grief. what has happened here has happened not without the will of the gods. the high lord of olympus does not permit creüsa to go with you to be with you on your journey where you are going. long exile will be yours, ploughing across vast seas until you come to hesperia, where lydian tiber gently flows between rich husbanded fields and where you will be happy, a king, and wedded to a royal wife. give up your weeping now for your creüsa; i, a dardan woman and the spouse of divine venus’s son, will never see the scornful households of the myrmidons or the dolopians, and never have to be a scullion slave in service to some greek matron. the mighty mother keeps me on these shores. farewell and may your care protect and cherish your child and mine.” and having spoken thus, the image of her receded into air, leaving me weeping, with so much still to say. three times i tried to embrace her and to hold her; three times the image, clasped in vain, escaped as if it were a breeze or on the wings of a vanishing dream. and so, the night being over, i returned to my companions where they were. when i got there i was amazed to see how many others, women and men, had come, wretched survivors of the fall of the city, to join us in the exile and the journey, a heartbreaking company, come from everywhere, ready in their hearts and with their fortunes, to follow me wherever i was going. and now the morning star was rising over the highest ridges of ida, bringing in the day that was beginning; the danaans held the city behind the gates that they had locked. there was no hope of further help. and so i acknowledged this, and taking up the burden of my father once again, i sought the hills. <line>","love,classic love,heartache & loss,relationships,mythology & folklore,greek & roman mythology,heroes & patriotism"

and from despair thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue vain warr with heav'n, and by success untaught his proud imaginations thus displaid. powers and dominions, deities of heav'n, for since no deep within her gulf can hold immortal vigor, though opprest and fall'n, i give not heav'n for lost. from this descent celestial vertues rising, will appear more glorious and more dread then from no fall, and trust themselves to fear no second fate: mee though just right, and the fixt laws of heav'n did first create your leader, next free choice, with what besides, in counsel or in fight, hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss thus farr at least recover'd, hath much more establisht in a safe unenvied throne yielded with full consent. the happier state in heav'n, which follows dignity, might draw envy from each inferior; but who here will envy whom the highest place exposes formost to stand against the thunderers aim your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share of endless pain? where there is then no good for which to strive, no strife can grow up there from faction; for none sure will claim in hell precedence, none, whose portion is so small of present pain, that with ambitious mind will covet more. with this advantage then to union, and firm faith, and firm accord, more then can be in heav'n, we now return to claim our just inheritance of old, surer to prosper then prosperity could have assur'd us; and by what best way, whether of open warr or covert guile, we now debate; who can advise, may speak. he ceas'd, and next him moloc, scepter'd king stood up, the strongest and the fiercest spirit that fought in heav'n; now fiercer by despair: his trust was with th' eternal to be deem'd equal in strength, and rather then be less car'd not to be at all; with that care lost went all his fear: of god, or hell, or worse he reck'd not, and these words thereafter spake. my sentence is for open warr: of wiles, more unexpert, i boast not: them let those contrive who need, or when they need, not now. for while they sit contriving, shall the rest, millions that stand in arms, and longing wait the signal to ascend, sit lingring here heav'ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place accept this dark opprobrious den of shame, the prison of his tyranny who reigns by our delay? no, let us rather choose arm'd with hell flames and fury all at once o're heav'ns high towrs to force resistless way, turning our tortures into horrid arms against the torturer; when to meet the noise of his almighty engin he shall hear infernal thunder, and for lightning see black fire and horror shot with equal rage among his angels; and his throne it self mixt with tartarean sulphur, and strange fire, his own invented torments. but perhaps the way seems difficult and steep to scale with upright wing against a higher foe. let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench of that forgetful lake benumm not still, that in our proper motion we ascend up to our native seat: descent and fall to us is adverse. who but felt of late when the fierce foe hung on our brok'n rear insulting, and pursu'd us through the deep, with what compulsion and laborious flight we sunk thus low? th' ascent is easie then; th' event is fear'd; should we again provoke our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find to our destruction: if there be in hell fear to be worse destroy'd: what can be worse then to dwell here, driv'n out from bliss, condemn'd in this abhorred deep to utter woe; where pain of unextinguishable fire must exercise us without hope of end the vassals of his anger, when the scourge inexorably, and the torturing hour calls us to penance? more destroy'd then thus we should be quite abolisht and expire. what fear we then? what doubt we to incense his utmost ire? which to the highth enrag'd, will either quite consume us, and reduce to nothing this essential, happier farr then miserable to have eternal being: or if our substance be indeed divine, and cannot cease to be, we are at worst on this side nothing; and by proof we feel our power sufficient to disturb his heav'n, and with perpetual inrodes to allarme, though inaccessible, his fatal throne: which if not victory is yet revenge. he ended frowning, and his look denounc'd desperate revenge, and battel dangerous to less then gods. on th' other side up rose belial, in act more graceful and humane; a fairer person lost not heav'n; he seemd for dignity compos'd and high exploit: but all was false and hollow; though his tongue dropt manna, and could make the worse appear the better reason, to perplex and dash maturest counsels: for his thoughts were low; to vice industrious, but to nobler deeds timorous and slothful: yet he pleas'd the ear, and with perswasive accent thus began. i should be much for open warr, o peers, as not behind in hate; if what was urg'd main reason to perswade immediate warr, did not disswade me most, and seem to cast ominous conjecture on the whole success: when he who most excels in fact of arms, in what he counsels and in what excels mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair and utter dissolution, as the scope of all his aim, after some dire revenge. first, what revenge? the towrs of heav'n are fill'd with armed watch, that render all access impregnable; oft on the bordering deep encamp thir legions, or with obscure wing scout farr and wide into the realm of night, scorning surprize. or could we break our way by force, and at our heels all hell should rise with blackest insurrection, to confound heav'ns purest light, yet our great enemy all incorruptible would on his throne sit unpolluted, and th' ethereal mould incapable of stain would soon expel her mischief, and purge off the baser fire victorious. thus repuls'd, our final hope is flat despair: we must exasperate th' almighty victor to spend all his rage, and that must end us, that must be our cure, to be no more; sad cure; for who would loose, though full of pain, this intellectual being, those thoughts that wander through eternity, to perish rather, swallowd up and lost in the wide womb of uncreated night, devoid of sense and motion? and who knows, let this be good, whether our angry foe can give it, or will ever? how he can is doubtful; that he never will is sure. will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, belike through impotence, or unaware, to give his enemies thir wish, and end them in his anger, whom his anger saves to punish endless? wherefore cease we then? say they who counsel warr, we are decreed, reserv'd and destin'd to eternal woe; whatever doing, what can we suffer more, what can we suffer worse? is this then worst, thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in arms? what when we fled amain, pursu'd and strook with heav'ns afflicting thunder, and besought the deep to shelter us? this hell then seem'd a refuge from those wounds: or when we lay chain'd on the burning lake? that sure was worse. what if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage and plunge us in the flames? or from above should intermitted vengeance arm again his red right hand to plague us? what if all her stores were open'd, and this firmament of hell should spout her cataracts of fire impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall one day upon our heads; while we perhaps designing or exhorting glorious warr, caught in a fierie tempest shall be hurl'd each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk under yon boyling ocean, wrapt in chains; there to converse with everlasting groans, unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd, ages of hopeless end; this would be worse. warr therefore, open or conceal'd, alike my voice disswades; for what can force or guile with him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye views all things at one view? he from heav'ns highth all these our motions vain, sees and derides; not more almighty to resist our might then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. shall we then live thus vile, the race of heav'n thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer here chains and these torments? better these then worse by my advice; since fate inevitable subdues us, and omnipotent decree, the victors will. to suffer, as to doe, our strength is equal, nor the law unjust that so ordains: this was at first resolv'd, if we were wise, against so great a foe contending, and so doubtful what might fall. i laugh, when those who at the spear are bold and vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear what yet they know must follow, to endure exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain, the sentence of thir conquerour: this is now our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, our supream foe in time may much remit his anger, and perhaps thus farr remov'd not mind us not offending, satisfi'd with what is punish't; whence these raging fires will slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames. our purer essence then will overcome thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not feel, or chang'd at length, and to the place conformd in temper and in nature, will receive familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain; this horror will grow milde, this darkness light, besides what hope the never-ending flight of future dayes may bring, what chance, what change worth waiting, since our present lot appeers for happy though but ill, for ill not worst, if we procure not to our selves more woe. thus belial with words cloath'd in reasons garb counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath, not peace: and after him thus mammon spake. either to disinthrone the king of heav'n we warr, if warr be best, or to regain our own right lost: him to unthrone we then may hope when everlasting fathe shall yeild to fickle chance and chaos judge the strife: the former vain to hope argues as vain the latter: for what place can be for us within heav'ns bound, unless heav'ns lord supream we overpower? suppose he should relent and publish grace to all, on promise made of new subjection; with what eyes could we stand in his presence humble, and receive strict laws impos'd, to celebrate his throne with warbl'd hymns, and to his god head sing forc't halleluia's; while he lordly sits our envied sovran, and his altar breathes ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers, our servile offerings. this must be our task in heav'n this our delight; how wearisom eternity so spent in worship paid to whom we hate. let us not then pursue by force impossible, by leave obtain'd unacceptable, though in heav'n, our state of splendid vassalage, but rather seek our own good from our selves, and from our own live to our selves, though in this vast recess, free, and to none accountable, preferring hard liberty before the easie yoke of servile pomp. our greatness will appeer then most conspicuous, when great things of small, useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse we can create, and in what place so e're thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain through labour and indurance. this deep world of darkness do we dread? how oft amidst thick clouds and dark doth heav'ns all-ruling sire choose to reside, his glory unobscur'd, and with the majesty of darkness round covers his throne; from whence deep thunders roar must'ring thir rage, and heav'n resembles hell? as he our darkness, cannot we his light imitate when we please? this desart soile wants not her hidden lustre, gemms and gold; nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise magnificence; and what can heav'n shew more? our torments also may in length of time become our elements, these piercing fires as soft as now severe, our temper chang'd into their temper; which must needs remove the sensible of pain. all things invite to peaceful counsels, and the settl'd state of order, how in safety best we may compose our present evils, with regard of what we are and were, dismissing quite all thoughts of warr: ye have what i advise. he scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld th' assembly, as when hollow rocks retain the sound of blustring winds, which all night long had rous'd the sea, now with hoarse cadence lull sea-faring men orewatcht, whose bark by chance or pinnace anchors in a craggy bay after the tempest: such applause was heard as mammon ended, and his sentence pleas'd, advising peace: for such another field they dreaded worse then hell: so much the fear of thunder and the sword of michael wrought still within them; and no less desire to found this nether empire, which might rise by pollicy, and long process of time, in emulation opposite to heav'n. which when beelzebub perceiv'd, then whom, satan except, none higher sat, with grave aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd a pillar of state; deep on his front engraven deliberation sat and public care; and princely counsel in his face yet shon, majestic though in ruin: sage he stood with atlantean shoulders fit to bear the weight of mightiest monarchies; his look drew audience and attention still as night or summers noon-tide air, while thus he spake. thrones and imperial powers, off-spring of heav'n ethereal vertues; or these titles now must we renounce, and changing stile be call'd princes of hell? for so the popular vote inclines, here to continue, and build up here a growing empire; doubtless; while we dream, and know not that the king of heav'n hath doom'd this place our dungeon, not our safe retreat beyond his potent arm, to live exempt from heav'ns high jurisdiction, in new league banded against his throne, but to remaine in strictest bondage, though thus far remov'd, under th' inevitable curb, reserv'd his captive multitude: for he, be sure in heighth or depth, still first and last will reign sole king, and of his kingdom loose no part by our revolt, but over hell extend his empire, and with iron scepter rule us here, as with his golden those in heav'n. what sit we then projecting peace and warr? warr hath determin'd us, and foild with loss irreparable; tearms of peace yet none voutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'n to us enslav'd, but custody severe, and stripes, and arbitrary punishment inflicted? and what peace can we return, but to our power hostility and hate, untam'd reluctance, and revenge though slow, yet ever plotting how the conqueror least may reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce in doing what we most in suffering feel? nor will occasion want, nor shall we need with dangerous expedition to invade heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or siege, or ambush from the deep. what if we find some easier enterprize? there is a place (if ancient and prophetic fame in heav'n err not) another world, the happy seat of some new race call'd man, about this time to be created like to us, though less in power and excellence, but favour'd more of him who rules above; so was his will pronounc'd among the gods, and by an oath, that shook heav'ns whol circumference, confirm'd. thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn what creatures there inhabit, of what mould, or substance, how endu'd, and what thir power, and where thir weakness, how attempted best, by force or suttlety: though heav'n be shut, and heav'ns high arbitrator sit secure in his own strength, this place may lye expos'd the utmost border of his kingdom, left to their defence who hold it: here perhaps som advantagious act may be achiev'd by sudden onset, either with hell fire to waste his whole creation, or possess all as our own, and drive as we were driven, the punie habitants, or if not drive, seduce them to our party, that thir god may prove thir foe, and with repenting hand abolish his own works. this would surpass common revenge, and interrupt his joy in our confusion, and our joy upraise in his disturbance; when his darling sons huri'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse thir frail original, and faded bliss, faded so soon. advise if this be worth attempting, or to sit in darkness here hatching vain empires. thus beelzebub pleaded his devilish counsel, first devis'd by satan, and in part propos'd: for whence, but from the author of all ill could spring so deep a malice, to confound the race of mankind in one root, and earth with hell to mingle and involve, done all to spite the great creatour? but thir spite still serves his glory to augment. the bold design pleas'd highly those infernal states, and joy sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full assent they vote: whereat his speech he thus renews. well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate, synod of gods, and like to what ye are, great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep will once more lift us up, in spight of fate, neerer our ancient seat; perhaps in view of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring arms and opportune excursion we may chance re-enter heav'n; or else in some milde zone dwell not unvisited of heav'ns fair light secure, and at the brightning orient beam purge off this gloom; the soft delicious air, to heal the scarr of these corrosive fires shall breathe her balme. but first whom shall we send in search of this new world, whom shall we find sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet the dark unbottom'd infinite abyss and through the palpable obscure find out his uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight upborn with indefatigable wings over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive the happy ile; what strength, what art can then suffice, or what evasion bear him safe through the strict senteries and stations thick of angels watching round? here he had need all circumspection, and we now no less choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send, the weight of all and our last hope relies. this said, he sat; and expectation held his look suspence, awaiting who appeer'd to second, or oppose, or undertake the perilous attempt: but all sat mute, pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each in others count'nance read his own dismay astonisht: none among the choice and prime of those heav'n-warring champions could be found so hardie as to proffer or accept alone the dreadful voyage; till at last satan, whom now transcendent glory rais'd above his fellows, with monarchal pride conscious of highest worth, unmov'd thus spake. o progeny of heav'n, empyreal thrones, with reason hath deep silence and demurr seis'd us, though undismaid: long is the way and hard, that out of hell leads up to light; our prison strong, this huge convex of fire, outrageous to devour, immures us round ninefold, and gates of burning adamant barr'd over us prohibit all egress. these past, if any pass, the void profound of unessential night receives him next wide gaping, and with utter loss of being threatens him, plung'd in that abortive gulf. if thence he scape into whatever world, or unknown region, what remains him less then unknown dangers and as hard escape. but i should ill become this throne, o peers, and this imperial sov'ranty, adorn'd with splendor, arm'd with power, if aught propos'd and judg'd of public moment, in the shape of difficulty or danger could deterr mee from attempting. wherefore do i assume these royalties, and not refuse to reign, refusing to accept as great a share of hazard as of honour, due alike to him who reigns, and so much to him due of hazard more, as he above the rest high honourd sits? go therfore mighty powers, terror of heav'n, though fall'n; intend at home, while here shall be our home, what best may ease the present misery, and render hell more tollerable; if there be cure or charm to respite or deceive, or slack the pain of this ill mansion: intermit no watch against a wakeful foe, while i abroad through all the coasts of dark destruction seek deliverance for us all: this enterprize none shall partake with me. thus saying rose the monarch, and prevented all reply, prudent, least from his resolution rais'd others among the chief might offer now (certain to be refus'd) what erst they feard; and so refus'd might in opinion stand his rivals, winning cheap the high repute which he through hazard huge must earn. but they dreaded not more th' adventure then his voice forbidding; and at once with him they rose; thir rising all at once was as the sound of thunder heard remote. towards him they bend with awful reverence prone; and as a god extoll him equal to the highest in heav'n: nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd, that for the general safety he despis'd his own: for neither do the spirits damn'd loose all thir virtue; least bad men should boast thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, or clos ambition varnisht o're with zeal. thus they thir doubtful consultations dark ended rejoycing in thir matchless chief: as when from mountain tops the dusky clouds ascending, while the north wind sleeps, o'respread heav'ns chearful face, the lowring element scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip snow, or showre; if chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet extend his ev'ning beam, the fields revive, the birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. o shame to men! devil with devil damn'd firm concord holds, men onely disagree of creatures rational, though under hope of heavenly grace: and god proclaiming peace, yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife among themselves, and levie cruel warres, wasting the earth, each other to destroy: as if (which might induce us to accord) man had not hellish foes anow besides, that day and night for his destruction waite. the stygian counsel thus dissolv'd; and forth in order came the grand infernal peers, midst came thir mighty paramount, and seemd alone th' antagonist of heav'n, nor less than hells dread emperour with pomp supream, and god-like imitated state; him round a globe of fierie seraphim inclos'd with bright imblazonrie, and horrent arms. then of thir session ended they bid cry with trumpets regal sound the great result: toward the four winds four speedy cherubim put to thir mouths the sounding alchymie by haralds voice explain'd: the hollow abyss heard farr and wide, and all the host of hell with deafning shout, return'd them loud acclaim. thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais'd by false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers disband, and wandring, each his several way pursues, as inclination or sad choice leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain the irksom hours, till this great chief return. part on the plain, or in the air sublime upon the wing, or in swift race contend, as at th' olympian games or pythian fields; part curb thir fierie steeds, or shun the goal with rapid wheels, or fronted brigads form. as when to warn proud cities warr appears wag'd in the troubl'd skie, and armies rush to battel in the clouds, before each van prick forth the aerie knights, and couch thir spears till thickest legions close; with feats of arms from either end of heav'n the welkin burns. others with vast typhoean rage more fell rend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air in whirlwind; hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. as when alcides from oechalia crown'd with conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore through pain up by the roots thessalian pines, and lichas from the top of oeta threw into th' euboic sea. others more milde, retreated in a silent valley, sing with notes angelical to many a harp thir own heroic deeds and hapless fall by doom of battel; and complain that fate free vertue should enthrall to force or chance. thir song was partial, but the harmony (what could it less when spirits immortal sing?) suspended hell, and took with ravishment the thronging audience. in discourse more sweet (for eloquence the soul, song charms the sense,) others apart sat on a hill retir'd, in thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high of providence, foreknowledge, will and fate, fixt fate, free will, foreknowledg absolute, and found no end, in wandring mazes lost. of good and evil much they argu'd then, of happiness and final misery, passion and apathie, and glory and shame, vain wisdom all, and false philosophie: yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm pain for a while or anguish, and excite fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brest with stubborn patience as with triple steel. another part in squadrons and gross bands, on bold adventure to discover wide that dismal world, if any clime perhaps might yield them easier habitation, bend four ways thir flying march, along the banks of four infernal rivers that disgorge into the burning lake thir baleful streams; abhorred styx the flood of deadly hate, sad acheron of sorrow, black and deep; cocytus, nam'd of lamentation loud heard on the ruful stream; fierce phlegeton whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. farr off from these a slow and silent stream, lethe the river of oblivion roules her watrie labyrinth, whereof who drinks, forthwith his former state and being forgets, forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. beyond this flood a frozen continent lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms of whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, a gulf profound as that serbonian bog betwixt damiata and mount casius old, where armies whole have sunk: the parching air burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of fire. thither by harpy-footed furies hail'd, at certain revolutions all the damn'd are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce, from beds of raging fire to starve in ice thir soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine immovable, infixt, and frozen round, periods of time, thence hurried back to fire. they ferry over this lethean sound both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment, and wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach the tempting stream, with one small drop to loose in sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, all in one moment, and so neer the brink; but fate withstands, and to oppose th' attempt medusa with gorgonian terror guards the ford, and of it self the water flies all taste of living wight, as once it fled the lip of tantalus. thus roving on in confus'd march forlorn, th' adventrous bands with shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast view'd first thir lamentable lot, and found no rest: through many a dark and drearie vaile they pass'd, and many a region dolorous, o're many a frozen, many a fierie alpe, rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death, a universe of death, which god by curse created evil, for evil only good, where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds, perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, abominable, inutterable, and worse than fables yet have feign'd, or fear conceiv'd, gorgons and hydra's, and chimera's dire. mean while the adversary of god and man, satan with thoughts inflam'd of highest design, puts on swift wings, and towards the gates of hell explores his solitary flight; som times he scours the right hand coast, som times the left, now shaves with level wing the deep, then soares up to the fiery concave touring high. as when farr off at sea a fleet descri'd hangs in the clouds, by aequinoctial winds close sailing from bengala, or the iles of ternate and tidore, whence merchants bring thir spicie drugs: they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole. so seem'd farr off the flying fiend: at last appeer hell bounds high reaching to the horrid roof, and thrice threefold the gates; three folds were brass, three iron, three of adamantine rock, impenetrable, impal'd with circling fire, yet unconsum'd. before the gates there sat on either side a formidable shape; the one seem'd woman to the waste, and fair, but ended foul in many a scaly fould voluminous and vast, a serpent arm'd with mortal sting: about her middle round a cry of hell hounds never ceasing bark'd with wide cerberian mouths full loud, and rung a hideous peal: yet, when they list, would creep, if aught disturb'd thir noyse, into her woomb, and kennel there, yet there still bark'd and howl'd, within unseen. farr less abhorrd than these vex'd scylla bathing in the sea that parts calabria from the hoarce trinacrian shore: nor uglier follow the night-hag, when call'd in secret, riding through the air she comes lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to dance with lapland witches, while the labouring moon eclipses at thir charms. the other shape, if shape it might be call'd that shape had none distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb, or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd, for each seem'd either; black it stood as night, fierce as ten furies, terrible as hell, and shook a dreadful dart; what seem'd his head the likeness of a kingly crown had on. satan was now at hand, and from his seat the monster moving onward came as fast with horrid strides, hell trembled as he strode. th' undaunted fiend what this might be admir'd, admir'd, not fear'd; god and his son except, created thing naught valu'd he nor shun'd; and with disdainful look thus first began. whence and what art thou, execrable shape, that dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance thy miscreated front athwart my way to yonder gates? through them i mean to pass, that be assur'd, without leave askt of thee: retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, hell-born, not to contend with spirits of heav'n. to whom the goblin full of wrauth reply'd, art thou that traitor angel, art thou hee, who first broke peace in heav'n and faith, till then unbrok'n, and in proud rebellious arms drew after him the third part of heav'ns sons conjur'd against the highest, for which both thou and they outcast from god, are here condemn'd to waste eternal dayes in woe and pain? and reck'n'st thou thy self with spirits of heav'n, hell-doom'd, and breath'st defiance here and scorn where i reign king, and to enrage thee more, thy king and lord? back to thy punishment, false fugitive, and to thy speed add wings, least with a whip of scorpions i pursue thy lingring, or with one stroke of this dart strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before. so spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape, so speaking and so threatning, grew tenfold more dreadful and deform: on th' other side incenst with indignation satan stood unterrifi'd, and like a comet burn'd, that fires the length of ophiucus huge in th' artick sky, and from his horrid hair shakes pestilence and warr. each at the head level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall hands no second stroke intend, and such a frown each cast at th' other, as when two black clouds with heav'ns artillery fraught, come rattling on over the caspian, then stand front to front hov'ring a space, till winds the signal blow to joyn thir dark encounter in mid air: so frownd the mighty combatants, that hell grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood; for never but once more was either like to meet so great a foe: and now great deeds had been achiev'd, whereof all hell had rung, had not the snakie sorceress that sat fast by hell gate, and kept the fatal key, ris'n, and with hideous outcry rush'd between. o father, what intends thy hand, she cry'd, against thy only son? what fury o son, possesses thee to bend that mortal dart against thy fathers head? and know'st for whom; for him who sits above and laughs the while at thee ordain'd his drudge, to execute what e're his wrath, which he calls justice, bids, his wrath which one day will destroy ye both. she spake, and at her words the hellish pest forbore, then these to her satan return'd: so strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange thou interposest, that my sudden hand prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds what it intends; till first i know of thee, what thing thou art, thus double-form'd, and why in this infernal vaile first met thou call'st me father, and that fantasm ca11'st my son? i know thee not, nor ever saw till now sight more detestable then him and thee. t' whom thus the portress of hell gate reply'd; hast thou forgot me then, and do i seem now in thine eyes so foul, once deemd so fair in heav'n, when at th' assembly, and in sight of all the seraphim with thee combin'd in bold conspiracy against heav'ns king, all on a sudden miserable pain surpris'd thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm in darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast threw forth, till on the left side op'ning wide, likest to thee in shape and count'nance bright, then shining heav'nly fair, a goddess arm'd out of thy head i sprung: amazement seis'd all th' host of heav'n; back they recoild affraid at first, and call'd me sin, and for a sign portentous held me; but familiar grown, i pleas'd, and with attractive graces won the most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft thy self in me thy perfect image viewing becam'st enamour'd, and such joy thou took'st with me in secret, that my womb conceiv'd a growing burden. mean while warr arose, and fields were fought in heav'n; wherein remaind (for what could else) to our almighty foe cleer victory, to our part loss and rout through all the empyrean: down they fell driv'n headlong from the pitch of heaven, down into this deep, and in the general fall i also; at which time this powerful key into my hand was giv'n, with charge to keep these gates for ever shut, which none can pass without my op'ning. pensive here i sat alone, but long i sat not, till my womb pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. at last this odious offspring whom thou seest thine own begotten, breaking violent way tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain distorted, all my nether shape thus grew transform'd: but he my inbred enemie forth issu'd, brandishing his fatal dart made to destroy: i fled, and cry'd out death; hell trembl'd at the hideous name, and sigh'd from all her caves, and back resounded death. i fled, but he pursu'd (though more, it seems, inflam'd with lust then rage) and swifter far, mee overtook his mother all dismaid, and in embraces forcible and foule ingendring with me, of that rape begot these yelling monsters that with ceasless cry surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv'd and hourly born, with sorrow infinite to me, for when they list into the womb that bred them they return, and howle and gnaw my bowels, thir repast; then bursting forth a fresh with conscious terrours vex me round, that rest or intermission none i find. before mine eyes in opposition sits grim death my son and foe, who sets them on, and me his parent would full soon devour for want of other prey, but that he knows his end with mine involvd; and knows that i should prove a bitter morsel, and his bane, when ever that shall be; so fate pronounc'd. but thou o father, i forewarn thee, shun his deadly arrow; neither vainly hope to be invulnerable in those bright arms, though temper'd heav'nly, for that mortal dint, save he who reigns above, none can resist. she finish'd, and the suttle fiend his lore soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth. dear daughter, since thou claim'st me for thy sire, and my fair son here showst me, the dear pledge of dalliance had with thee in heav'n, and joys then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know i come no enemie, but to set free from out this dark and dismal house of pain, both him and thee, and all the heav'nly host of spirits that in our just pretenses arm'd fell with us from on high: from them i go this uncouth errand sole, and one for all my self expose, with lonely steps to tread th' unfounded deep, and through the void immense to search with wandring quest a place foretold should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now created vast and round, a place of bliss in the pourlieues of heav'n, and therein plac't a race of upstart creatures, to supply perhaps our vacant room, though more remov'd, least heav'n surcharg'd with potent multitude might hap to move new broiles: be this or aught then this more secret now design'd, i haste to know, and this once known, shall soon return, and bring ye to the place where thou and death shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen wing silently the buxom air, imbalm'd with odours; there ye shall be fed and fill'd immeasurably, all things shall be your prey. he ceas'd, for both seemd highly pleasd, and death grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear his famine should be fill'd, and blest his mawe destin'd to that good hour: no less rejoyc'd his mother bad, and thus bespake her sire. the key of this infernal pit by due, and by command of heav'ns all-powerful king i keep, by him forbidden to unlock these adamantine gates; against all force death ready stands to interpose his dart, fearless to be o'rmatcht by living might. but what ow i to his commands above who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down into this gloom of tartarus profound, to sit in hateful office here confin'd, inhabitant of heav'n, and heav'nlie-born, here in perpetual agonie and pain, with terrors and with clamors compasst round of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed: thou art my father, thou my author, thou my being gav'st me; whom should i obey but thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon to that new world of light and bliss, among the gods who live at ease, where i shall reign at thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems thy daughter and thy darling, without end. thus saying, from her side the fatal key, sad instrument of all our woe, she took; and towards the gate rouling her bestial train, forthwith the huge porcullis high up drew, which but her self not all the stygian powers could once have mov'd; then in the key-hole turns th' intricate wards, and every bolt and bar of massie iron or sollid rock with ease unfast'ns: on a sudden op'n flie with impetuous recoile and jarring sound th' infernal dores, and on thir hinges grate harsh thunder, that the lowest bottom shook of erebus. she op'nd, but to shut excel'd her power; the gates wide op'n stood, that with extended wings a bannerd host under spread ensigns marching might pass through with horse and chariots rankt in loose array; so wide they stood, and like a furnace mouth cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame. before thir eyes in sudden view appear the secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark illimitable ocean without bound, without dimension, where length, breadth, & highth, and time and place are lost; where eldest night and chaos. ancestors of nature, hold eternal anarchie, amidst the noise of endless warrs, and by confusion stand. for hot, cold, moist, and dry, four champions fierce strive here for maistrie, and to battel bring thir embryon atoms; they around the flag of each his faction, in thir several clanns, light-arm'd or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow, swarm populous, unnumber'd as the sands of barca or cyrene's torrid soil, levied to side with warring winds, and poise thir lighter wings. to whom these most adhere, hee rules a moment; chaos umpire sits, and by decision more imbroiles the fray by which he reigns: next him high arbiter chance governs all. into this wilde abyss, the womb of nature and perhaps her grave, of neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire, but all these in thir pregnant causes mixt confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight, unless th' almighty maker them ordain his dark materials to create more worlds, into this wild abyss the warie fiend stood on the brink of hell and look'd a while, pondering his voyage; for no narrow frith he had to cross. nor was his eare less peal'd with noises loud and ruinous (to compare great things with small) then when bellona storms, with all her battering engines bent to rase som capital city; or less then if this frame of heav'n were falling, and these elements in mutinie had from her axle torn the stedfast earth. at last his sail-broad vannes he spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a league as in a cloudy chair ascending rides audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets a vast vacuitie: all unawares fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour down had been falling, had not by ill chance the strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud instinct with fire and nitre hurried him as many miles aloft: that furie stay'd, quencht in a boggie syrtis, neither sea, nor good dry land: nigh founderd on he fares, treading the crude consistence, half on foot, half flying; behoves him now both oare and saile. as when a gryfon through the wilderness with winged course ore hill or moarie dale, pursues the arimaspian, who by stelth had from his wakeful custody purloind the guarded gold: so eagerly the fiend ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, with head, hands, wings or feet pursues his way, and swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes: at length a universal hubbub wilde of stunning sounds and voices all confus'd born through the hollow dark assaults his eare with loudest vehemence: thither he plyes, undaunted to meet there what ever power or spirit of the nethermost abyss might in that noise reside, of whom to ask which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes bordering on light; when strait behold the throne of chaos, and his dark pavilion spread wide on the wasteful deep; with him enthron'd sat sable-vested night, eldest of things, the consort of his reign; and by them stood orcus and ades, and the dreaded name of demogorgon; rumor next and chance, and tumult and confusion all imbroild, and discord with a thousand various mouths. t' whom satan turning boldly, thus. ye powers and spirits of this nethermost abyss, chaos and ancient night, i come no spy, with purpose to explore or to disturb the secrets of your realm, but by constraint wandring this darksome desart, as my way, lies through your spacious empire up to light, alone, and without guide, half lost, i seek what readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds confine with heav'n; or if som other place from your dominion won, th' ethereal king possesses lately, thither to arrive i travel this profound, direct my course; directed no mean recompence it brings to your behoof, if i that region lost, all usurpation thence expell'd, reduce to her original darkness and your sway (which is my present journey) and once more erect the standard there of ancient night; yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge. thus satan; and him thus the anarch old with faultring speech and visage incompos'd answer'd. i know thee, stranger, who thou art, that mighty leading angel, who of late made head against heav'ns king, though overthrown. i saw and heard, for such a numerous host fled not in silence through the frighted deep with ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, confusion worse confounded; and heav'n gates pourd out by millions her victorious bands pursuing. i upon my frontieres here keep residence; if all i can will serve, that little which is left so to defend, encroacht on still through our intestine broiles weakning the scepter of old night: first hell your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath; now lately heaven and earth, another world hung ore my realm, link'd in a golden chain to that side heav'n from whence your legions fell: if that way be your walk, you have not farr; so much the neerer danger; go and speed; havock and spoil and ruin are my gain. he ceas'd; and satan staid not to reply, but glad that now his sea should find a shore, with fresh alacritie and force renew'd springs upward like a pyramid of fire into the wilde expanse, and through the shock of fighting elements, on all sides round environ'd wins his way; harder beset and more endanger'd, then when argo pass'd through bosporus betwixt the justling rocks: or when ulysses on the larbord shunnd charybdis, and by th' other whirlpool steard. so he with difficulty and labour hard mov'd on, with difficulty and labour hee; but hee once past, soon after when man fell, strange alteration! sin and death amain following his track, such was the will of heav'n, pav'd after him a broad and beat'n way over the dark abyss, whose boiling gulf tamely endur'd a bridge of wondrous length from hell continu'd reaching th' utmost orbe of this frail world; by which the spirits perverse with easie intercourse pass to and fro to tempt or punish mortals, except whom god and good angels guard by special grace. but now at last the sacred influence of light appears, and from the walls of heav'n shoots farr into the bosom of dim night a glimmering dawn; here nature first begins her fardest verge, and chaos to retire as from her outmost works a brok'd foe with tumult less and with less hostile din, that satan with less toil, and now with ease wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light and like a weather-beaten vessel holds gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn; or in the emptier waste, resembling air, weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold farr off th' empyreal heav'n, extended wide in circuit, undetermind square or round, with opal towrs and battlements adorn'd of living saphire, once his native seat; and fast by hanging in a golden chain this pendant world, in bigness as a starr of smallest magnitude close by the moon. thither full fraught with mischievous revenge, accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies. <line>","religion,christianity,god & the divine"

12382,7122,"<line> <line>the year’s twelve daughters had in turn gone by, of measured pace tho’ varying mien all twelve, some froward, some sedater, some adorn’d for festival, some reckless of attire. the snow had left the mountain-top; fresh flowers had withered in the meadow; fig and prune hung wrinkling; the last apple glow’d amid its freckled leaves; and weary oxen blinkt between the trodden corn and twisted vine, under whose bunches stood the empty crate, to creak ere long beneath them carried home. this was the season when twelve months before, o gentle hamadryad, true to love! thy mansion, thy dim mansion in the wood was blasted and laid desolate: but none dared violate its precincts, none dared pluck the moss beneath it, which alone remain’d of what was thine. old thallinos sat mute in solitary sadness. the strange tale (not until rhaicos died, but then the whole) echion had related, whom no force could ever make look back upon the oaks. the father said “echion! thou must weigh, carefully, and with steady hand, enough (although no longer comes the store as once!) of wax to burn all day and night upon that hollow stone where milk and honey lie: so may the gods, so may the dead, be pleas’d!” thallinos bore it thither in the morn, and lighted it and left it. first of those who visited upon this solemn day the hamadryad’s oak, were rhodope and acon; of one age, one hope, one trust. graceful was she as was the nymph whose fate she sorrowed for: he slender, pale, and first lapt by the flame of love: his father’s lands were fertile, herds lowed over them afar. now stood the two aside the hollow stone and lookt with stedfast eyes toward the oak shivered and black and bare. “may never we love as they loved!” said acon. she at this smiled, for he said not what he meant to say, and thought not of its bliss, but of its end. he caught the flying smile, and blusht, and vow’d nor time nor other power, whereto the might of love hath yielded and may yield again, should alter his. the father of the youth wanted not beauty for him, wanted not song, that could lift earth’s weight from off his heart, discretion, that could guide him thro’ the world, innocence, that could clear his way to heaven; silver and gold and land, not green before the ancestral gate, but purple under skies bending far off, he wanted for his heir. fathers have given life, but virgin heart they never gave; and dare they then control or check it harshly? dare they break a bond girt round it by the holiest power on high? acon was grieved, he said, grieved bitterly, but acon had complied . . ’twas dutiful! crush thy own heart, man! man! but fear to wound the gentler, that relies on thee alone, by thee created, weak or strong by thee; touch it not but for worship; watch before its sanctuary; nor leave it till are closed the temple-doors and the last lamp is spent. rhodope, in her soul’s waste solitude, sate mournful by the dull-resounding sea, often not hearing it, and many tears had the cold breezes hardened on her cheek. meanwhile he sauntered in the wood of oaks, nor shun’d to look upon the hollow stone that held the milk and honey, nor to lay his plighted hand where recently ’twas laid opposite hers, when finger playfully advanced and pusht back finger, on each side. he did not think of this, as she would do if she were there alone. the day was hot; the moss invited him; it cool’d his cheek, it cool’d his hands; he thrust them into it and sank to slumber. never was there dream divine as his. he saw the hamadryad. she took him by the arm and led him on along a valley, where profusely grew the smaller lilies with their pendent bells, and, hiding under mint, chill drosera, the violet shy of butting cyclamen, the feathery fern, and, browser of moist banks, her offspring round her, the soft strawberry; the quivering spray of ruddy tamarisk, the oleander’s light-hair’d progeny breathing bright freshness in each other’s face, and graceful rose, bending her brow, with cup of fragrance and of beauty, boon for gods. the fragrance fill’d his breast with such delight his senses were bewildered, and he thought he saw again the face he most had loved. he stopt: the hamadryad at his side now stood between; then drew him farther off: he went, compliant as before: but soon verdure had ceast: altho’ the ground was smooth, nothing was there delightful. at this change he would have spoken, but his guide represt all questioning, and said, “weak youth! what brought thy footstep to this wood, my native haunt, my life-long residence? this bank, where first i sate with him . . the faithful (now i know, too late!) the faithful rhaicos. haste thee home; be happy, if thou canst; but come no more where those whom death alone could sever, died.” he started up: the moss whereon he slept was dried and withered: deadlier paleness spread over his cheek; he sickened: and the sire had land enough; it held his only son. <line>","relationships,family & ancestors,nature,landscapes & pastorals,mythology & folklore,greek & roman mythology,heroes & patriotism"

12398,1602,"<line> <line> the time has been that these wild solitudes, yet beautiful as wild, were trod by me oftener than now; and when the ills of life had chafed my spirit—when the unsteady pulse beat with strange flutterings—i would wander forth and seek the woods. the sunshine on my path was to me a friend. the swelling hills, the quiet dells retiring far between, with gentle invitation to explore their windings, were a calm society that talked with me and soothed me. then the chant of birds, and chime of brooks, and soft caress of the fresh sylvan air, made me forget the thoughts that broke my peace, and i began to gather simples by the fountain’s brink, and lose myself in day-dreams. while i stood in nature’s loneliness, i was with one with whom i early grew familiar, one who never had a frown for me, whose voice never rebuked me for the hours i stole from cares i loved not, but of which the world deems highest, to converse with her. when shrieked the bleak november winds, and smote the woods, and the brown fields were herbless, and the shades, that met above the merry rivulet, were spoiled, i sought, i loved them still; they seemed like old companions in adversity. still there was beauty in my walks; the brook, bordered with sparkling frost-work, was as gay as with its fringe of summer flowers. afar, the village with its spires, the path of streams and dim receding valleys, hid before by interposing trees, lay visible through the bare grove, and my familiar haunts seemed new to me. nor was i slow to come among them, when the clouds, from their still skirts, had shaken down on earth the feathery snow, and all was white. the pure keen air abroad, albeit it breathed no scent of herb, nor heard love-call of bird nor merry hum of bee, was not the air of death. bright mosses crept over the spotted trunks, and the close buds, that lay along the boughs, instinct with life, patient, and waiting the soft breath of spring, feared not the piercing spirit of the north. the snow-bird twittered on the beechen bough, and ’neath the hemlock, whose thick branches bent beneath its bright cold burden, and kept dry a circle, on the earth, of withered leaves, the partridge found a shelter. through the snow the rabbit sprang away. the lighter track of fox, and the raccoon’s broad path, were there, crossing each other. from his hollow tree the squirrel was abroad, gathering the nuts just fallen, that asked the winter cold and sway of winter blast, to shake them from their hold. but winter has yet brighter scenes—he boasts splendors beyond what gorgeous summer knows; or autumn with his many fruits, and woods all flushed with many hues. come when the rains have glazed the snow and clothed the trees with ice, while the slant of sun of february pours into the bowers a flood of light. approach! the incrusted surface shall upbear thy steps, and the broad arching portals of the grove welcome thy entering. look! the massy trunks are cased in pure crystal; each light spray, nodding and tinkling in the breath of heaven, is studded with its trembling water-drops, that glimmer with an amethystine light. but round the parent-stem the long low boughs bend, in a glittering ring, and arbors hide the glassy floor. oh! you might deem the spot the spacious cavern of some virgin mine, deep in the womb of earth—where the gems grow, and diamonds put forth radiant rods and bud with amethyst and topaz—and the place lit up, most royally, with the pure beam that dwells in them. or haply the vast hall of fairy palace, that outlasts the night, and fades not in the glory of the sun;— where crystal columns send forth slender shafts and crossing arches; and fantastic aisles wind from the sight in brightness, and are lost among the crowded pillars. raise thine eye; thou seest no cavern roof; no palace vault; there the blue sky and the white drifting cloud look in. again the wildered fancy dreams of spouting fountains, frozen as they rose, and fixed, with all their branching jets, in air, and all their sluices sealed. all, all is light; light without shade. but all shall pass away with the next sun. from numberless vast trunks loosened, the crashing ice shall make a sound like the far roar of rivers, and the eve shall close o’er the brown woods as it was wont. and it is pleasant, when the noisy streams are just set free, and milder suns melt off the plashy snow, save only the firm drift in the deep glen or the close shade of pines— ’tis pleasant to behold the wreaths of smoke roll up among the maples of the hill, where the shrill sound of youthful voices wakes the shriller echo, as the clear pure lymph, that from the wounded trees, in twinkling drops, falls, mid the golden brightness of the morn, is gathered in with brimming pails, and oft, wielded by sturdy hands, the stroke of axe makes the woods ring. along the quiet air, come and float calmly off the soft light clouds, such as you see in summer, and the winds scarce stir the branches. lodged in sunny cleft, where the cold breezes come not, blooms alone the little wind-flower, whose just opened eye is blue as the spring heaven it gazes at— startling the loiterer in the naked groves with unexpected beauty, for the time of blossoms and green leaves is yet afar. and ere it comes, the encountering winds shall oft muster their wrath again, and rapid clouds shade heaven, and bounding on the frozen earth shall fall their volleyed stores, rounded like hail and white like snow, and the loud north again shall buffet the vexed forest in his rage. <line>","nature,landscapes & pastorals,weather,winter,social commentaries,town & country life"

<line> <line>oh, towering ronnie reagan, <line> <line>wise and resigned lover of redwoods, <line> <line>deeply beloved, winning man-child of the yearning republic <line> <line>from diaper to football field to warner brothers sound-stages, <line> <line>be thou our grinning, gently phallic, big boy of all the ages! <line> <line> salt peanuts, salt peanuts, for dear hearts and gentle people, and cheerful, shining, simple uncle sam! nigger, read this and run! now, if you can't read, run anyhow! from manifest destiny (cortez, and all his men silent upon a peak in darien) to a decent interval, and the chopper rises above saigon, abandoning the noble cause and the people we have made ignoble and whom we leave there, now, to die, one moves, with all deliberate speed, to the south china sea, and beyond, where millions of new niggers await glad tidings! no, said the great man's lady, i'm against abortion, i always feel that's killing somebody. well, what about capital punishment? i think the death penalty helps. that's right. up to our ass in niggers on death row. oh, susanna, don't you cry for me! <line> <line>2 <line> <line>well, i guess what the niggers is supposed to be doing is putting themselves in the path of that old sweet chariot and have it swing down and carry us home. that would help, as they say, and they got ways of sort of nudging the chariot. they still got influence with wind and water, though they in for some surprises with cloud and fire. my days are not their days. my ways are not their ways. i would not think of them, one way or the other, did not they so grotesquely block the view between me and my brother. and, so, i always wonder: can blindness be desired? then, what must the blinded eyes have seen to wish to see no more! for, i have seen, in the eyes regarding me, or regarding my brother, have seen, deep in the farthest valley of the eye, have seen a flame leap up, then flicker and go out, have seen a veil come down, leaving myself, and the other, alone in that cave which every soul remembers, and out of which, desperately afraid, i turn, turn, stagger, stumble out, into the healing air, fall flat on the healing ground, singing praises, counselling my heart, my soul, to praise. what is it that this people cannot forget? surely, they cannot be deluded as to imagine that their crimes are original? there is nothing in the least original about the fiery tongs to the eyeballs, the sex torn from the socket, the infant ripped from the womb, the brains dashed out against rock, nothing original about judas, or peter, or you or me: nothing: we are liars and cowards all, or nearly all, or nearly all the time: for we also ride the lightning, answer the thunder, penetrate whirlwinds, curl up on the floor of the sun, and pick our teeth with thunderbolts. then, perhaps they imagine that their crimes are not crimes? perhaps. perhaps that is why they cannot repent, why there is no possibility of repentance. manifest destiny is a hymn to madness, feeding on itself, ending (when it ends) in madness: the action is blindness and pain, pain bringing a torpor so deep that every act is willed, is desperately forced, is willed to be a blow: the hand becomes a fist, the prick becomes a club, the womb a dangerous swamp, the hope, and fear, of love is acid in the marrow of the bone. no, their fire is not quenched, nor can be: the oil feeding the flames being the unadmitted terror of the wrath of god. yes. but let us put it in another, less theological way: though theology has absolutely nothing to do with what i am trying to say. but the moment god is mentioned theology is summoned to buttress or demolish belief: an exercise which renders belief irrelevant and adds to the despair of fifth avenue on any afternoon, the people moving, homeless, through the city, praying to find sanctuary before the sky and the towers come tumbling down, before the earth opens, as it does in superman. they know that no one will appear to turn back time, they know it, just as they know that the earth has opened before and will open again, just as they know that their empire is falling, is doomed, nothing can hold it up, nothing. we are not talking about belief. <line> <line>3 <line> <line>i wonder how they think <line> <line> <line> <line>the niggers made, make it, how come the niggers are still here. but, then, again, i don't think they dare to think of that: no: i'm fairly certain they don't think of that at all. lord, i with the alabaster lady of the house, with beulah. beulah about sixty, built in four-square, biceps like mohammed ali, she at the stove, fixing biscuits, scrambling eggs and bacon, fixing coffee, pouring juice, and the lady of the house, she say, she don't know how she'd get along without beulah and beulah just silently grunts, i reckon you don't, and keeps on keeping on and the lady of the house say she's just like one of the family, and beulah turns, gives me a look, sucks her teeth and rolls her eyes in the direction of the lady's back, and keeps on keeping on. while they are containing russia and entering onto the quicksand of china and patronizing africa, and calculating the caribbean plunder, and the south china sea booty, the niggers are aware that no one has discussed anything at all with the niggers. well. niggers don't own nothing, got no flag, even our names are hand-me-downs and you don't change that by calling yourself x: sometimes that just makes it worse, like obliterating the path that leads back to whence you came, and to where you can begin. and, anyway, none of this changes the reality, which is, for example, that i do not want my son to die in guantanamo, or anywhere else, for that matter, serving the stars and stripes. (i've seen some stars. i got some stripes.) neither (incidentally) has anyone discussed the bomb with the niggers: the incoherent feeling is, the less the nigger knows about the bomb, the better: the lady of the house smiles nervously in your direction as though she had just been overheard discussing family, or sexual secrets, and changes the subject to education, or full employment, or the welfare rolls, the smile saying, don't be dismayed. we know how you feel. you can trust us. yeah. i would like to believe you. but we are not talking about belief. <line> <line>4the sons of greed, the heirs of plunder, are approaching the end of their journey: it is amazing that they approach without wonder, as though they have, themselves, become that scorched and blasphemed earth, the stricken buffalo, the slaughtered tribes, the endless, virgin, bloodsoaked plain, the famine, the silence, the children's eyes, murder masquerading as salvation, seducing every democratic eye, the mouths of truth and anguish choked with cotton, rape delirious with the fragrance of magnolia, the hacking of the fruit of their loins to pieces, hey! the tar-baby sons and nephews, the high-yaller <line> <line> nieces, <line> <line>and tom's black prick hacked off <line> <line> <line> <line>to rustle in crinoline, to hang, heaviest of heirlooms, between the pink and alabaster breasts of the great man's lady, or worked into the sash at the waist of the high-yaller creole bitch, or niece, a chunk of shining brown-black satin, staring, staring, like the single eye of god: creation yearns to re-create a time when we were able to recognize a crime. alas, my stricken kinsmen, the party is over: there have never been any white people, anywhere: the trick was accomplished with mirrors— look: where is your image now? where your inheritance, on what rock stands this pride? oh, i counsel you, leave history alone. she is exhausted, sitting, staring into her dressing-room mirror, and wondering what rabbit, now, to pull out of what hat, and seriously considering retirement, even though she knows her public dare not let her go. she must change. yes. history must change. a slow, syncopated relentless music begins suggesting her re-entry, transformed, virginal as she was, in the beginning, untouched, as the word was spoken, before the rape which debased her to be the whore of multitudes, or, as one might say, before she became the star, whose name, above our title, carries the show, making history the patsy, responsible for every flubbed line, every missed cue, responsible for the life and death, of all bright illusions and dark delusions, lord, history is weary of her unspeakable liaison with time, for time and history have never seen eye to eye: time laughs at history and time and time and time again time traps history in a lie. but we always, somehow, managed to roar history back onstage to take another bow, to justify, to sanctify the journey until now. time warned us to ask for our money back, and disagreed with history as concerns colours white and black. not only do we come from further back, but the light of the sun marries all colours as one. kinsmen, i have seen you betray your saviour (it is you who call him saviour) so many times, and i have spoken to him about you, behind your back. quite a lot has been going on behind your back, and, if your phone has not yet been disconnected, it will soon begin to ring: informing you, for example, that a whole generation, in africa, is about to die, and a new generation is about to rise, and will not need your bribes, or your persuasions, any more: not your morality. no plundered gold— ah! kinsmen, if i could make you see the crime is not what you have done to me! it is you who are blind, you, bowed down with chains, you, whose children mock you, and seek another master, you, who cannot look man or woman or child in the eye, whose sleep is blank with terror, for whom love died long ago, somewhere between the airport and the safe-deposit box, the buying and selling of rising or falling stocks, you, who miss zanzibar and madagascar and kilimanjaro and lions and tigers and elephants and zebras and flying fish and crocodiles and alligators and leopards and crashing waterfalls and endless rivers, flowers fresher than eden, silence sweeter than the grace of god, passion at every turning, throbbing in the bush, thicker, oh, than honey in the hive, dripping dripping opening, welcoming, aching from toe to bottom to spine, sweet heaven on the line to last forever, yes, but, now, rejoicing ends, man, a price remains to pay, your innocence costs too much and we can't carry you on our books or our backs, any longer: baby, find another eden, another apple tree, somewhere, if you can, and find some other natives, somewhere else, to listen to you bellow till you come, just like a man, but we don't need you, are sick of being a fantasy to feed you, and of being the principal accomplice to your crime: for, it is your crime, now, the cross to which you cling, your alpha and omega for everything. well (others have told you) your clown's grown weary, the puppet master is bored speechless with this monotonous disaster, and is long gone, does not belong to you, any more than my woman, or my child, ever belonged to you. during this long travail our ancestors spoke to us, and we listened, and we tried to make you hear life in our song but now it matters not at all to me whether you know what i am talking about—or not: i know why we are not blinded by your brightness, are able to see you, who cannot see us. i know why we are still here. godspeed. the niggers are calculating, from day to day, life everlasting, and wish you well: but decline to imitate the son of the morning, and rule in hell. <line>","history & politics,money & economics,race & ethnicity,war & conflict"

'twas heavy then to hear thy voice of moan, but this is worse, that thou art speechless grown. thou hast forgot thy name thou hadst; thou wast nothing but she, and her thou hast o'erpast. for, as a child kept from the font until a prince, expected long, come to fulfill the ceremonies, thou unnam'd had'st laid, had not her coming, thee her palace made; her name defin'd thee, gave thee form, and frame, and thou forget'st to celebrate thy name. some months she hath been dead (but being dead, measures of times are all determined) but long she'ath been away, long, long, yet none offers to tell us who it is that's gone. but as in states doubtful of future heirs, when sickness without remedy impairs the present prince, they're loath it should be said, ""the prince doth languish,"" or ""the prince is dead;"" so mankind feeling now a general thaw, a strong example gone, equal to law, the cement which did faithfully compact and glue all virtues, now resolv'd, and slack'd, thought it some blasphemy to say sh'was dead, or that our weakness was discovered in that confession; therefore spoke no more than tongues, the soul being gone, the loss deplore. but though it be too late to succour thee, sick world, yea dead, yea putrified, since she thy' intrinsic balm, and thy preservative, can never be renew'd, thou never live, i (since no man can make thee live) will try, what we may gain by thy anatomy. her death hath taught us dearly that thou art corrupt and mortal in thy purest part. let no man say, the world itself being dead, 'tis labour lost to have discovered the world's infirmities, since there is none alive to study this dissection; for there's a kind of world remaining still, though she which did inanimate and fill the world, be gone, yet in this last long night, her ghost doth walk; that is a glimmering light, a faint weak love of virtue, and of good, reflects from her on them which understood her worth; and though she have shut in all day, the twilight of her memory doth stay, which, from the carcass of the old world free, creates a new world, and new creatures be produc'd. the matter and the stuff of this, her virtue, and the form our practice is. and though to be thus elemented, arm these creatures from home-born intrinsic harm, (for all assum'd unto this dignity so many weedless paradises be, which of themselves produce no venomous sin, except some foreign serpent bring it in) yet, because outward storms the strongest break, and strength itself by confidence grows weak, this new world may be safer, being told the dangers and diseases of the old; for with due temper men do then forgo, or covet things, when they their true worth know. there is no health; physicians say that we at best enjoy but a neutrality. and can there be worse sickness than to know that we are never well, nor can be so? we are born ruinous: poor mothers cry that children come not right, nor orderly; except they headlong come and fall upon an ominous precipitation. how witty's ruin! how importunate upon mankind! it labour'd to frustrate even god's purpose; and made woman, sent for man's relief, cause of his languishment. they were to good ends, and they are so still, but accessory, and principal in ill, for that first marriage was our funeral; one woman at one blow, then kill'd us all, and singly, one by one, they kill us now. we do delightfully our selves allow to that consumption; and profusely blind, we kill our selves to propagate our kind. and yet we do not that; we are not men; there is not now that mankind, which was then, when as the sun and man did seem to strive, (joint tenants of the world) who should survive; when stag, and raven, and the long-liv'd tree, compar'd with man, died in minority; when, if a slow-pac'd star had stol'n away from the observer's marking, he might stay two or three hundred years to see't again, and then make up his observation plain; when, as the age was long, the size was great (man's growth confess'd, and recompens'd the meat), so spacious and large, that every soul did a fair kingdom, and large realm control; and when the very stature, thus erect, did that soul a good way towards heaven direct. where is this mankind now? who lives to age, fit to be made methusalem his page? alas, we scarce live long enough to try whether a true-made clock run right, or lie. old grandsires talk of yesterday with sorrow, and for our children we reserve tomorrow. so short is life, that every peasant strives, in a torn house, or field, to have three lives. and as in lasting, so in length is man contracted to an inch, who was a span; for had a man at first in forests stray'd, or shipwrack'd in the sea, one would have laid a wager, that an elephant, or whale, that met him, would not hastily assail a thing so equall to him; now alas, the fairies, and the pigmies well may pass as credible; mankind decays so soon, we'are scarce our fathers' shadows cast at noon, only death adds t'our length: nor are we grown in stature to be men, till we are none. but this were light, did our less volume hold all the old text; or had we chang'd to gold their silver; or dispos'd into less glass spirits of virtue, which then scatter'd was. but 'tis not so; w'are not retir'd, but damp'd; and as our bodies, so our minds are cramp'd; 'tis shrinking, not close weaving, that hath thus in mind and body both bedwarfed us. we seem ambitious, god's whole work t'undo; of nothing he made us, and we strive too, to bring our selves to nothing back; and we do what we can, to do't so soon as he. with new diseases on our selves we war, and with new physic, a worse engine far. thus man, this world's vice-emperor, in whom all faculties, all graces are at home (and if in other creatures they appear, they're but man's ministers and legates there to work on their rebellions, and reduce them to civility, and to man's use); this man, whom god did woo, and loath t'attend till man came up, did down to man descend, this man, so great, that all that is, is his, o what a trifle, and poor thing he is! if man were anything, he's nothing now; help, or at least some time to waste, allow t'his other wants, yet when he did depart with her whom we lament, he lost his heart. she, of whom th'ancients seem'd to prophesy, when they call'd virtues by the name of she; she in whom virtue was so much refin'd, that for alloy unto so pure a mind she took the weaker sex; she that could drive the poisonous tincture, and the stain of eve, out of her thoughts, and deeds, and purify all, by a true religious alchemy, she, she is dead; she's dead: when thou knowest this, thou knowest how poor a trifling thing man is, and learn'st thus much by our anatomy, the heart being perish'd, no part can be free, and that except thou feed (not banquet) on the supernatural food, religion, thy better growth grows withered, and scant; be more than man, or thou'rt less than an ant. then, as mankind, so is the world's whole frame quite out of joint, almost created lame, for, before god had made up all the rest, corruption ent'red, and deprav'd the best; it seiz'd the angels, and then first of all the world did in her cradle take a fall, and turn'd her brains, and took a general maim, wronging each joint of th'universal frame. the noblest part, man, felt it first; and then both beasts and plants, curs'd in the curse of man. so did the world from the first hour decay, that evening was beginning of the day, and now the springs and summers which we see, like sons of women after fifty be. and new philosophy calls all in doubt, the element of fire is quite put out, the sun is lost, and th'earth, and no man's wit can well direct him where to look for it. and freely men confess that this world's spent, when in the planets and the firmament they seek so many new; they see that this is crumbled out again to his atomies. 'tis all in pieces, all coherence gone, all just supply, and all relation; prince, subject, father, son, are things forgot, for every man alone thinks he hath got to be a phoenix, and that then can be none of that kind, of which he is, but he. this is the world's condition now, and now she that should all parts to reunion bow, she that had all magnetic force alone, to draw, and fasten sund'red parts in one; she whom wise nature had invented then when she observ'd that every sort of men did in their voyage in this world's sea stray, and needed a new compass for their way; she that was best and first original of all fair copies, and the general steward to fate; she whose rich eyes and breast gilt the west indies, and perfum'd the east; whose having breath'd in this world, did bestow spice on those isles, and bade them still smell so, and that rich india which doth gold inter, is but as single money, coin'd from her; she to whom this world must it self refer, as suburbs or the microcosm of her, she, she is dead; she's dead: when thou know'st this, thou know'st how lame a cripple this world is <line>","living,death,disappointment & failure,sorrow & grieving,time & brevity,relationships,men & women,religion,christianity,faith & doubt,god & the divine,arts & sciences,philosophy,social commentaries,gender & sexuality,history & politics,war & conflict"

(just sixteen, the kid at the station will quote her as saying, ""what a pity you have to work today! it's not right... what weather! goodness, what a night it'll be!"" he'll add: ""she sure was pretty."") was there a change of plan? why the stop for gas? possibly she'd not yet made up her mind? or had made it up but not yet settled on a place? or could it be she knew where she was headed, what she would do— and wanted to make sure the car ran for hours afterward? might the car not be, then, a sort of beacon, a lighthouse- in-reverse, meant to direct one not away from but toward the shore and its broken boulders, there to spot the bobbing white flag of a blouse? her brief note, which will appear in the local leader, contains a phrase (""she chanted snatches of old lands"") that will muddle the town for three days, until a professor e. h. wade pins it to ophelia—and reprimands the police, who, this but goes to show, have not the barest knowledge of shakespeare, else would never have misread ""lauds"" as ""lands."" a detective gregg messing will answer, tersely, ""afraid it's not our bailiwick. missing persons, yes; missing poems, no."" (what's truly tragic's never allowed to stand alone for long, of course. at each moment there's a crowd of clowns pressing in: the booming ass at every wake who, angling a loud necktie in the chip dip, airs his problems with intestinal gas, or the blow-dried bonehead out to sell siding to the grieving mother . . . . well, wade sent the leader another briefword: ""decades of service to the bard now force me to amend the girl's little slip. 'chaunted' not 'chanted' is the preferred . . ."") yet none of her unshakeable entourage —pedants, pundits, cops without a clue, and a yearning young grease-monkey—are alerted yet. still the empty car idles, idles on the cliff, and night isn't falling so much as day is floating out to sea . . . . soon, whether she's found or not, her lights will draw moths and tiny dark-winged things that might be dirt-clumps, ashes. come what may, the night will be lovely, as she foresaw, the first stars easing through the blue, engine and ocean breathing together. <line>","living,death,nature,seas, rivers, & streams,arts & sciences,poetry & poets"

12720,895,"<line> <line>all night the dreadless angel unpursu'd through heav'ns wide champain held his way, till morn, wak't by the circling hours, with rosie hand unbarr'd the gates of light. there is a cave within the mount of god, fast by his throne, where light and darkness in perpetual round lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through heav'n grateful vicissitude, like day and night; light issues forth, and at the other dore obsequious darkness enters, till her houre to veile the heav'n, though darkness there might well seem twilight here; and now went forth the morn such as in highest heav'n, arrayd in gold empyreal, from before her vanisht night, shot through with orient beams: when all the plain coverd with thick embatteld squadrons bright, chariots and flaming armes, and fierie steeds reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view: warr he perceav'd, warr in procinct, and found already known what he for news had thought to have reported: gladly then he mixt among those friendly powers who him receav'd with joy and acclamations loud, that one that of so many myriads fall'n, yet one returnd not lost: on to the sacred hill they led him high applauded, and present before the seat supream; from whence a voice from midst a golden cloud thus milde was heard. servant of god, well done, well hast thou fought the better fight, who single hast maintaind against revolted multitudes the cause of truth, in word mightier then they in armes; and for the testimonie of truth hast born universal reproach, far worse to beare then violence: for this was all thy care to stand approv'd in sight of god, though worlds judg'd thee perverse: the easier conquest now remains thee, aided by this host of friends, back on thy foes more glorious to return then scornd thou didst depart, and to subdue by force, who reason for thir law refuse, right reason for thir law, and for thir king messiah, who by right of merit reigns. go michael of celestial armies prince, and thou in military prowess next gabriel, lead forth to battel these my sons invincible, lead forth my armed saints by thousands and by millions rang'd for fight; equal in number to that godless crew rebellious, them with fire and hostile arms fearless assault, and to the brow of heav'n pursuing drive them out from god and bliss, into thir place of punishment, the gulf of tartarus, which ready opens wide his fiery chaos to receave thir fall. so spake the sovran voice, and clouds began to darken all the hill, and smoak to rowl in duskie wreathes, reluctant flames, the signe of wrauth awak't: nor with less dread the loud ethereal trumpet from on high gan blow: at which command the powers militant, that stood for heav'n, in mighty quadrate joyn""d of union irresistible, mov'd on in silence thir bright legions, to the sound of instrumental harmonie that breath'd heroic ardor to advent'rous deeds under thir god-like leaders, in the cause of god and his messiah. on they move indissolubly firm; nor obvious hill, nor streit'ning vale, nor wood, nor stream divides thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground thir march was, and the passive air upbore thir nimble tread, as when the total kind of birds in orderly array on wing came summond over eden to receive thir names of thee; so over many a tract of heav'n they march'd, and many a province wide tenfold the length of this terrene: at last farr in th' horizon to the north appeer'd from skirt to skirt a fierie region, stretcht in battailous aspect, and neerer view bristl'd with upright beams innumerable of rigid spears, and helmets throng'd, and shields various, with boastful argument portraid, the banded powers of satan hasting on with furious expedition; for they weend that self same day by fight, or by surprize to win the mount of god, and on his throne to set the envier of his state, the proud aspirer, but thir thoughts prov'd fond and vain in the mid way: though strange to us it seemd at first, that angel should with angel warr, and in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet so oft in festivals of joy and love unanimous, as sons of one great sire hymning th' eternal father: but the shout of battel now began, and rushing sound of onset ended soon each milder thought. high in the midst exalted as a god th' apostat in his sun-bright chariot sate idol of majestie divine, enclos'd with flaming cherubim, and golden shields; then lighted from his gorgeous throne, for now 'twixt host and host but narrow space was left, a dreadful intervall, and front to front presented stood in terrible array of hideous length: before the cloudie van, on the rough edge of battel ere it joyn,d, satan with vast and haughtie strides advanc't, came towring, armd in adamant and gold; abdiel that sight endur'd not, where he stood among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds, and thus his own undaunted heart explores. o heav'n! that such resemblance of the highest should yet remain, where faith and realtie remain not; wherfore should not strength and might there fail where vertue fails, or weakest prove where boldest; though to sight unconquerable? his puissance, trusting in th' almightie's aide, i mean to try, whose reason i have tri'd unsound and false; nor is it aught but just, that he who in debate of truth hath won, should win in arms, in both disputes alike victor; though brutish that contest and foule, when reason hath to deal with force, yet so most reason is that reason overcome. so pondering, and from his armed peers forth stepping opposite, half way he met his daring foe, at this prevention more incens't, and thus securely him defi'd. proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht the highth of thy aspiring unoppos'd, the throne of god unguarded, and his side abandond at the terror of thy power or potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain against th' omnipotent to rise in arms; who out of smallest things could without end have rais'd incessant armies to defeat thy folly; or with solitarie hand reaching beyond all limit at one blow unaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd thy legions under darkness; but thou seest all are not of thy train; there be who faith prefer, and pietie to god, though then to thee not visible, when i alone seemd in thy world erroneous to dissent from all: my sect thou seest, now learn too late how few somtimes may know, when thousands err. whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance thus answerd. ill for thee, but in wisht houre of my revenge, first sought for thou returnst from flight, seditious angel, to receave thy merited reward, the first assay of this right hand provok't, since first that tongue inspir'd with contradiction durst oppose a third part of the gods, in synod met thir deities to assert, who while they feel vigour divine within them, can allow omnipotence to none. but well thou comst before thy fellows, ambitious to win from me som plume, that thy success may show destruction to the rest: this pause between (unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know; at first i thought that libertie and heav'n to heav'nly soules had bin all one; but now i see that most through sloth had rather serve, ministring spirits, traind up in feast and song; such hast thou arm'd, the ministrelsie of heav'n, servilitie with freedom to contend, as both thir deeds compar'd this day shall prove. to whom in brief thus abdiel stern repli'd. apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find of erring, from the path of truth remote: unjustly thou deprav'st it with the name of servitude to serve whom god ordains, or nature; god and nature bid the same, when he who rules is worthiest, and excells them whom he governs. this is servitude, to serve th' unwise, or him who hath rebelld against his worthier, as thine now serve thee, thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall'd; yet leudly dar'st our ministring upbraid. reign thou in hell thy kingdom, let mee serve in heav'n god ever blest, and his divine behests obey, worthiest to be obey'd, yet chains in hell, not realms expect: mean while from mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight, this greeting on thy impious crest receive. so saying, a noble stroke he lifted high, which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell on the proud crest of satan, that no sight, nor motion of swift thought, less could his shield such ruin intercept: ten paces huge he back recoild; the tenth on bended knee his massie spear upstaid; as if on earth winds under ground or waters forcing way sidelong, had push't a mountain from his seat half sunk with all his pines. amazement seis'd the rebel thrones, but greater rage to see thus foil'd thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout, presage of victorie and fierce desire of battel: whereat michael bid sound th' arch-angel trumpet; through the vast of heaven it sounded, and the faithful armies rung hosanna to the highest: nor stood at gaze the adverse legions, nor less hideous joyn'd the horrid shock: now storming furie rose, and clamour such as heard in heav'n till now was never, arms on armour clashing bray'd horrible discord, and the madding wheeles of brazen chariots rag'd; dire was the noise of conflict; over head the dismal hiss of fiery darts in flaming volies flew, and flying vaulted either host with fire. so under fierie cope together rush'd both battels maine, with ruinous assault and inextinguishable rage; all heav'n resounded, and had earth bin then, all earth had to her center shook. what wonder? when millions of fierce encountring angels fought on either side, the least of whom could weild these elements, and arm him with the force of all thir regions: how much more of power armie against armie numberless to raise dreadful combustion warring, and disturb, though not destroy, thir happie native seat; had not th' eternal king omnipotent from his strong hold of heav'n high over-rul'd and limited thir might; though numberd such as each divided legion might have seemd a numerous host, in strength each armed hand a legion; led in fight, yet leader seemd each warriour single as in chief, expert when to advance, or stand, or turn the sway of battel, open when, and when to close the ridges of grim warr; no thought of flight, none of retreat, no unbecoming deed that argu'd fear; each on himself reli'd, as onely in his arm the moment lay of victorie; deeds of eternal fame were don, but infinite: for wide was spred that warr and various; somtimes on firm ground a standing fight, then soaring on main wing tormented all the air; all air seemd then conflicting fire: long time in eeven scale the battel hung; till satan, who that day prodigious power had shewn, and met in armes no equal, raunging through the dire attack of fighting seraphim confus'd, at length saw where the sword of michael smote, and fell'd squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down wide wasting; such destruction to withstand he hasted, and oppos'd the rockie orb of tenfold adamant, his ample shield a vast circumference: at his approach the great arch-angel from his warlike toile surceas'd, and glad as hoping here to end intestine war in heav'n, the arch foe subdu'd or captive drag'd in chains, with hostile frown and visage all enflam'd first thus began. author of evil, unknown till thy revolt, unnam'd in heav'n, now plenteous, as thou seest these acts of hateful strife, hateful to all, though heaviest by just measure on thy self and thy adherents: how hast thou disturb d heav'ns blessed peace, and into nature brought miserie, uncreated till the crime of thy rebellion? how hast thou instill'd thy malice into thousands, once upright and faithful, now prov'd false. but think not here to trouble holy rest; heav'n casts thee out from all her confines. heav'n the seat of bliss brooks not the works of violence and warr. hence then, and evil go with thee along thy ofspring, to the place of evil, hell, thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles, ere this avenging sword begin thy doome, or som more sudden vengeance wing'd from god precipitate thee with augmented paine. so spake the prince of angels; to whom thus the adversarie. nor think thou with wind of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds thou canst not. hast thou turnd the least of these to flight, or if to fall, but that they rise unvanquisht, easier to transact with mee that thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats to chase me hence? erre not that so shall end the strife which thou call'st evil, but wee style the strife of glorie: which we mean to win, or turn this heav'n it self into the hell thou fablest, here however to dwell free, if not to reign: mean while thy utmost force, and join him nam'd almighty to thy aid, i flie not, but have sought thee farr and nigh. they ended parle, and both addrest for fight unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue of angels, can relate, or to what things liken on earth conspicuous, that may lift human imagination to such highth of godlike power: for likest gods they seemd, stood they or mov'd, in stature, motion, arms fit to decide the empire of great heav'n. now wav'd thir fierie swords, and in the aire made horrid circles; two broad suns thir shields blaz'd opposite, while expectation stood in horror; from each hand with speed retir'd where erst was thickest fight, th' angelic throng, and left large field, unsafe within the wind of such commotion, such as to set forth great things by small, if natures concord broke, among the constellations warr were sprung, two planets rushing from aspect maligne of fiercest opposition in mid skie, should combat, and thir jarring sphears confound. together both with next to almightie arme, uplifted imminent one stroke they aim'd that might determine, and not need repeate, as not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd in might or swift prevention; but the sword of michael from the armorie of god was giv'n him temperd so, that neither keen nor solid might resist that edge: it met the sword of satan with steep force to smite descending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid, but with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar'd all his right side; then satan first knew pain, and writh'd him to and fro convolv'd; so sore the griding sword with discontinuous wound pass'd through him, but th' ethereal substance clos'd not long divisible, and from the gash a stream of nectarous humor issuing flow'd sanguin, such as celestial spirits may bleed, and all his armour staind ere while so bright. forthwith on all sides to his aide was run by angels many and strong, who interpos'd defence, while others bore him on thir shields back to his chariot; where it stood retir'd from off the files of warr; there they him laid gnashing for anguish and despite and shame to find himself not matchless, and his pride humbl'd by such rebuke, so farr beneath his confidence to equal god in power. yet soon he heal'd; for spirits that live throughout vital in every part, not as frail man in entrailes, heart or head, liver or reines; cannot but by annihilating die; nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound receive, no more then can the fluid aire: all heart they live, all head, all eye, all eare, all intellect, all sense, and as they please, they limb themselves, and colour, shape or size assume, as likes them best, condense or rare. mean while in other parts like deeds deservd memorial, where the might of gabriel fought, and with fierce ensignes pierc'd the deep array of moloc furious king, who him defi'd, and at his chariot wheeles to drag him bound threatn'd, nor from the holie one of heav'n refrein'd his tongue blasphemous; but anon down clov'n to the waste, with shatterd armes and uncouth paine fled bellowing. on each wing uriel and raphael his vaunting foe, though huge, and in a rock of diamond armd, vanquish'd adramelec, and asmadai, two potent thrones, that to be less then gods disdain'd, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight, mangl'd with gastly wounds through plate and maile, nor stood unmindful abdiel to annoy the atheist crew, but with redoubl'd blow ariel and arioc, and the violence of ramiel scorcht and blasted overthrew. i might relate of thousands, and thir names eternize here on earth; but those elect angels contented with thir fame in heav'n seek not the praise of men: the other sort in might though wondrous and in acts of warr, nor of renown less eager, yet by doome canceld from heav'n and sacred memorie, nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell. for strength from truth divided and from just, illaudable, naught merits but dispraise and ignominie, yet to glorie aspires vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame: therfore eternal silence be thir doome. and now thir mightiest quelld, the battel swerv'd, with many an inrode gor'd; deformed rout enter'd, and foul disorder; all the ground with shiverd armour strow'n, and on a heap chariot and charioter lay overturnd and fierie foaming steeds; what stood, recoyld orewearied, through the faint satanic host defensive scarse, or with pale fear surpris'd, then first with fear surpris'd and sense of paine fled ignominious, to such evil brought by sin of disobedience, till that hour not liable to fear or flight or paine. far otherwise th' inviolable saints in cubic phalanx firm advanc't entire, invulnerable, impenitrably arm'd: such high advantages thir innocence gave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd, not to have disobei'd; in fight they stood unwearied, unobnoxious to be pain'd by wound, though from thir place by violence mov'd. now night her course began, and over heav'n inducing darkness, grateful truce impos'd, and silence on the odious dinn of warr: under her cloudie covert both retir'd, victor and vanquisht: on the foughten field michael and his angels prevalent encamping, plac'd in guard thir watches round, cherubic waving fires: on th' other part satan with his rebellious disappeerd, far in the dark dislodg'd, and void of rest, his potentates to councel call'd by night; and in the midst thus undismai'd began. o now in danger tri'd, now known in armes not to be overpowerd, companions deare, found worthy not of libertie alone, too mean pretense, but what we more affect, honour, dominion, glorie, and renowne, who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight (and if one day, why not eternal dayes?) what heavens lord had powerfullest to send against us from about his throne, and judg'd sufficient to subdue us to his will, but proves not so: then fallible, it seems, of future we may deem him, though till now omniscient thought. true is, less firmly arm'd, some disadvantage we endur'd and paine, till now not known, but known as soon contemnd, since now we find this our empyreal form incapable of mortal injurie imperishable, and though peirc'd with wound, soon closing, and by native vigour heal'd. of evil then so small as easie think the remedie; perhaps more valid armes, weapons more violent, when next we meet, may serve to better us, and worse our foes, or equal what between us made the odds, in nature none: if other hidden cause left them superiour, while we can preserve unhurt our mindes, and understanding sound, due search and consultation will disclose. he sat; and in th' assembly next upstood nisroc of principalities the prime; as one he stood escap't from cruel fight, sore toild, his riv'n armes to havoc hewn, and cioudie in aspect thus answering spake. deliverer from new lords, leader to free enjoyment of our right as gods; yet hard for gods, and too unequal work we find against unequal armes to fight in paine, against unpaind, impassive; from which evil ruin must needs ensue; for what availes valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands of mightiest. sense of pleasure we may well spare out of life perhaps, and not repine, but live content, which is the calmest life: but pain is perfet miserie, the worst of evils, and excessive, overturnes all patience. he who therefore can invent with what more forcible we may offend our yet unwounded enemies, or arme our selves with like defence, to me deserves no less then for deliverance what we owe. whereto with look compos'd satan repli'd. not uninvented that, which thou aright believst so main to our success, i bring; which of us who beholds the bright surface of this ethereous mould whereon we stand, this continent of spacious heav'n, adornd with plant, fruit, flour ambrosial, gemms & gold, whose eye so superficially surveyes these things, as not to mind from whence they grow deep under ground, materials dark and crude, of spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht with heav'ns ray, and temperd they shoot forth so beauteous, op'ning to the ambient light. these in thir dark nativitie the deep shall yield us pregnant with infernal flame, which into hallow engins long and round thick-rammd, at th' other bore with touch of fire dilated and infuriate shall send forth from far with thundring noise among our foes such implements of mischief as shall dash to pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd the thunderer of his only dreaded bolt. nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne, effect shall end our wish. mean while revive; abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind think nothing hard, much less to be despaird. he ended, and his words thir drooping chere enlightn'd, and thir languisht hope reviv'd. th' invention all admir'd, and each, how hee to be th' inventer miss'd, so easie it seemd once found, which yet unfound most would have thought impossible: yet haply of thy race in future dayes, if malice should aboun, some one intent on mischief, or inspir'd with dev'lish machination might devise like instrument to plague the sons of men for sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent. forthwith from councel to the work they flew, none arguing stood, innumerable hands were ready, in a moment up they turnd wide the celestial soile, and saw beneath th' originals of nature in thir crude conception; sulphurous and nitrous foame they found, they mingl'd, and with suttle art, concocted and adusted they reduc'd to blackest grain, and into store convey'd: part hidd'n veins diggd up (nor hath this earth entrails unlike) of mineral and stone, whereof to found thir engins and thir balls of missive ruin; part incentive reed provide, pernicious with one touch to fire. so all ere day-spring, under conscious night secret they finish'd, and in order set, with silent circumspection unespi'd. now when fair morn orient in heav'n appeerd up rose the victor angels, and to arms the matin trumpet sung: in arms they stood of golden panoplie, refulgent host, soon banded; others from the dawning hills lookd round, and scouts each coast light-armed scoure, each quarter, to descrie the distant foe, where lodg'd, or whither fled, or if for fight, in motion or in alt: him soon they met under spred ensignes moving nigh, in slow but firm battalion; back with speediest sail zophiel, of cherubim the swiftest wing, came flying, and in mid aire aloud thus cri'd. arme, warriours, arme for fight, the foe at hand, whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit this day, fear not his flight; so thick a cloud he comes, and settl'd in his face i see sad resolution and secure: let each his adamantine coat gird well, and each fit well his helme, gripe fast his orbed shield, born eevn or high, for this day will pour down, if i conjecture aught, no drizling showr, but ratling storm of arrows barbd with fire. so warnd he them aware themselves, and soon in order, quit of all impediment; instant without disturb they took allarm, and onward move embattelld; when behold not distant far with heavie pace the foe approaching gross and huge; in hollow cube training his devilish enginrie, impal'd on every side with shaddowing squadrons deep, to hide the fraud. at interview both stood a while, but suddenly at head appeerd satan: and thus was heard commanding loud. vanguard, to right and left the front unfould; that all may see who hate us, how we seek peace and composure, and with open brest stand readie to receive them, if they like our overture, and turn not back perverse; but that i doubt, however witness heaven, heav'n witness thou anon, while we discharge freely our part; yee who appointed stand do as you have in charge, and briefly touch what we propound, and loud that all may hear. so scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce had ended; when to right and left the front divided, and to either flank retir'd. which to our eyes discoverd new and strange, a triple mounted row of pillars laid on wheels (for like to pillars most they seem'd or hollow'd bodies made of oak or firr with branches lopt, in wood or mountain fell'd) brass, iron, stonie mould, had not thir mouthes with hideous orifice gap't on us wide, portending hollow truce; at each behind a seraph stood, and in his hand a reed stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense, collected stood within our thoughts amus'd, not long, for sudden all at once thir reeds put forth, and to a narrow vent appli'd with nicest touch. immediate in a flame, but soon obscur'd with smoak, all heav'n appeerd, from those deep throated engins belcht, whose roar emboweld with outragious noise the air, and all her entrails tore, disgorging foule thir devilish glut, chaind thunderbolts and hail of iron globes, which on the victor host level'd, with such impetuous furie smote, that whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand, though standing else as rocks, but down they fell by thousands, angel on arch-angel rowl'd; the sooner for thir arms, unarm'd they might have easily as spirits evaded swift by quick contraction or remove; but now foule dissipation follow'd and forc't rout; nor serv'd it to relax thir serried files. what should they do? if on they rusht, repulse repeated, and indecent overthrow doubl'd, would render them yet more despis'd, and to thir foes a laughter; for in view stood rankt of seraphim another row in posture to displode thir second tire of thunder: back defeated to return they worse abhorr'd. satan beheld thir plight, and to his mates thus in derision call'd. o friends, why come not on these victors proud? ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee, to entertain them fair with open front and brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms of composition, strait they chang'd thir minds, flew off, and into strange vagaries fell, as they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps for joy of offerd peace: but i suppose if our proposals once again were heard we should compel them to a quick result. to whom thus belial in like gamesom mood, leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight, of hard contents, and full of force urg'd home, such as we might perceive amus'd them all, and stumbl'd many, who receives them right, had need from head to foot well understand; not understood, this gift they have besides, they shew us when our foes walk not upright. so they among themselves in pleasant veine stood scoffing, highthn'd in thir thoughts beyond all doubt of victorie, eternal might to match with thir inventions they presum'd so easie, and of his thunder made a scorn, and all his host derided, while they stood a while in trouble; but they stood not long, rage prompted them at length, and found them arms against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. forthwith (behold the excellence, the power which god hath in his mighty angels plac'd) thir arms away they threw, and to the hills (for earth hath this variety from heav'n of pleasure situate in hill and dale) light as the lightning glimps they ran, they flew, from thir foundations loosning to and fro they pluckt the seated hills with all thir load, rocks, waters, woods, and by the shaggie tops up lifting bore them in thir hands: amaze, be sure, and terrour seis'd the rebel host, when coming towards them so dread they saw the bottom of the mountains upward turn'd, till on those cursed engins triple-row they saw them whelm'd, and all thir confidence under the weight of mountains buried deep, themselves invaded next, and on thir heads main promontories flung, which in the air came shadowing, and opprest whole legions arm'd, thir armor help'd thir harm, crush't in and bruis'd into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain implacable, and many a dolorous groan, long strugling underneath, ere they could wind out of such prison, though spirits of purest light, purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. the rest in imitation to like armes betook them, and the neighbouring hills uptore; so hills amid the air encounterd hills hurl'd to and fro with jaculation dire that under ground, they fought in dismal shade; infernal noise; warr seem'd a civil game to this uproar; horrid confusion heapt upon confusion rose: and now all heav'n had gon to wrack, with ruin overspred, had not th' almightie father where he sits shrin'd in his sanctuarie of heav'n secure, consulting on the sum of things, foreseen this tumult, and permitted all, advis'd: that his great purpose he might so fulfill, to honour his anointed son aveng'd upon his enemies, and to declare all power on him transferr'd: whence to his son th' assessor of his throne he thus began. effulgence of my glorie, son belov'd, son in whose face invisible is beheld visibly, what by deitie i am, and in whose hand what by decree i doe, second omnipotence, two dayes are past, two dayes, as we compute the dayes of heav'n, since michael and his powers went forth to tame these disobedient; sore hath been thir fight, as likeliest was, when two such foes met arm'd; for to themselves i left them, and thou knowst, equal in their creation they were form'd, save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought insensibly, for i suspend thir doom; whence in perpetual fight they needs must last endless, and no solution will be found: warr wearied hath perform'd what warr can do, and to disorder'd rage let loose the reines, with mountains as with weapons arm'd, which makes wild work in heav'n, and dangerous to the maine. two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine; for thee i have ordain'd it, and thus farr have sufferd, that the glorie may be thine of ending this great warr, since none but thou can end it. into thee such vertue and grace immense i have transfus'd, that all may know in heav'n and hell thy power above compare, and this perverse commotion governd thus, to manifest thee worthiest to be heir of all things, to be heir and to be king by sacred unction, thy deserved right. go then thou mightiest in thy fathers might, ascend my chariot, guide the rapid wheeles that shake heav'ns basis, bring forth all my warr, my bow and thunder, my almightie arms gird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh; pursue these sons of darkness, drive them out from all heav'ns bounds into the utter deep: there let them learn, as likes them, to despise god and messiah his anointed king. he said, and on his son with rayes direct shon full, he all his father full expresst ineffably into his face receiv'd, and thus the filial godhead answering spake. o father, o supream of heav'nly thrones, first, highest, holiest, best, thou alwayes seekst to glorifie thy son, i alwayes thee, as is most just; this i my glorie account, my exaltation, and my whole delight, that thou in me well pleas'd, declarst thy will fulfill'd, which to fulfil is all my bliss. scepter and power, thy giving, i assume, and gladlier shall resign, when in the end thou shalt be all in all, and i in thee for ever, and in mee all whom thou lov'st: but whom thou hat'st, i hate, and can put on thy terrors, as i put thy mildness on, image of thee in all things; and shall soon, armd with thy might, rid heav'n of these rebell'd, to thir prepar'd ill mansion driven down to chains of darkness, and th' undying worm, that from thy just obedience could revolt, whom to obey is happiness entire. then shall thy saints unmixt, and from th' impure farr separate, circling thy holy mount unfained halleluiahs to thee sing, hymns of high praise, and i among them chief. so said, he o're his scepter bowing, rose from the right hand of glorie where he sate, and the third sacred morn began to shine dawning through heav'n: forth rush'd with whirlwind sound the chariot of paternal deitie, flashing thick flames, wheele within wheele undrawn, it self instinct with spirit, but convoyd by four cherubic shapes, four faces each had wondrous, as with starrs thir bodies all and wings were set with eyes, with eyes the wheels of beril, and careering fires between; over thir heads a chrystal firmament, whereon a saphir throne, inlaid with pure amber, and colours of the showrie arch. hee in celestial panoplie all armd of radiant urim, work divinely wrought, ascended, at his right hand victorie sate eagle-wing'd, beside him hung his bow and quiver with three-bolted thunder stor'd, and from about him fierce effusion rowld of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire; attended with ten thousand thousand saints, he onward came, farr off his coming shon, and twentie thousand (i thir number heard) chariots of god, half on each hand were seen: hee on the wings of cherub rode sublime on the chrystallin skie, in saphir thron'd. illustrious farr and wide, but by his own first seen, them unexpected joy surpriz'd, when the great ensign of messiah blaz'd aloft by angels born, his sign in heav'n: under whose conduct michael soon reduc'd his armie, circumfus'd on either wing, under thir head imbodied all in one. before him power divine his way prepar'd; at his command the uprooted hills retir'd each to his place, they heard his voice and went obsequious, heav'n his wonted face renewd, and with fresh flourets hill and valley smil'd. this saw his hapless foes but stood obdur'd, and to rebellious fight rallied thir powers insensate, hope conceiving from despair. in heav'nly spirits could such perverseness dwell? but to convince the proud what signs availe, or wonders move th' obdurate to relent? they hard'nd more by what might most reclame, grieving to see his glorie, at the sight took envie, and aspiring to his highth, stood reimbattell'd fierce, by force or fraud weening to prosper, and at length prevaile against god and messiah, or to fall in universal ruin last, and now to final battel drew, disdaining flight, or faint retreat; when the great son of god to all his host on either hand thus spake. stand still in bright array ye saints, here stand ye angels arm'd, this day from battel rest; faithful hath been your warfare, and of god accepted, fearless in his righteous cause, and as ye have receivd, so have ye don invincibly; but of this cursed crew the punishment to other hand belongs, vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints; number to this dayes work is not ordain'd nor multitude, stand onely and behold gods indignation on these godless pourd by mee, not you but mee they have despis'd, yet envied; against mee is all thir rage, because the father, t' whom in heav'n supream kingdom and power and glorie appertains, hath honourd me according to his will. therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig'n'd; that they may have thir wish, to trie with mee in battel which the stronger proves, they all, or i alone against them, since by strength they measure all, of other excellence not emulous, nor care who them excells; nor other strife with them do i voutsafe. so spake the son, and into terrour chang'd his count'nance too severe to be beheld and full of wrauth bent on his enemies. at once the four spred out thir starrie wings with dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbes of his fierce chariot rowld, as with the sound of torrent floods, or of a numerous host. hee on his impious foes right onward drove, gloomie as night; under his burning wheeles the stedfast empyrean shook throughout, all but the throne it self of god. full soon among them he arriv'd; in his right hand grasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent before him, such as in thir soules infix'd plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost, all courage; down thir idle weapons drop'd; o're shields and helmes, and helmed heads he rode of thrones and mighty seraphim prostrate, that wisht the mountains now might be again thrown on them as a shelter from his ire. nor less on either side tempestuous fell his arrows, from the fourfold-visag'd foure, distinct with eyes, and from the living wheels distinct alike with multitude of eyes, one spirit in them rul'd, and every eye glar'd lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire among th' accurst, that witherd all thir strength, and of thir wonted vigour left them draind, exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall'n. yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd his thunder in mid volie, for he meant not to destroy, but root them out of heav'n: the overthrown he rais'd, and as a heard of goats or timerous flock together throngd drove them before him thunder-struck, pursu'd with terrors and with furies to the bounds and chrystal wall of heav'n, which op'ning wide, rowld inward, and a spacious gap disclos'd into the wastful deep; the monstrous sight strook them with horror backward, but far worse urg'd them behind; headlong themselves they threw down from the verge of heav'n, eternal wrauth burnt after them to the bottomless pit. hell heard th' unsufferable noise, hell saw heav'n ruining from heav'n and would have fled affrighted; but strict fate had cast too deep her dark foundations, and too fast had bound. nine dayes they fell; confounded chaos roard, and felt tenfold confusion in thir fall through his wilde anarchie, so huge a rout incumberd him with ruin: hell at last yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos'd, hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire unquenchable, the house of woe and paine. disburd'nd heav'n rejoic'd, and soon repaird her mural breach, returning whence it rowld. sole victor from th' expulsion of his foes messiah his triumphal chariot turnd: to meet him all his saints, who silent stood eye witnesses of his almightie acts, with jubilie advanc'd; and as they went, shaded with branching palme, each order bright, sung triumph, and him sung victorious king, son, heir, and lord, to him dominion giv'n, worthiest to reign: he celebrated rode triumphant through mid heav'n, into the courts and temple of his migihtie father thron'd on high: who into glorie him receav'd, where now he sits at the right hand of bliss. thus measuring things in heav'n by things on earth at thy request, and that thou maist beware by what is past, to thee i have reveal'd what might have else to human race bin hid; the discord which befel, and warr in heav'n among th' angelic powers, and the deep fall of those too high aspiring, who rebelld with satan, hee who envies now thy state, who now is plotting how he may seduce thee also from obedience, that with him bereavd of happiness thou maist partake his punishment, eternal miserie; which would be all his solace and revenge, as a despite don against the most high, thee once to gaine companion of his woe. but list'n not to his temptations, warne thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard by terrible example the reward of disobedience;

<line> <line>southward they say profound night, mother of furies, <line> <line>sits tight-lipped among the crowding shades, <line> <line>or thence aurora draws the daylight back; <line> <line>and where the east exhales the yellow morning, <line> <line>reddening evening lights her stars at last. <line> <line>iv. as for the winter, when the freezing rains <line> <line>confine the farmer, he may employ himself <line> <line>in preparations for serener seasons. <line> <line>the plowman beats the plowshare on the forge, <line> <line>or makes his vats of tree-trunks hollowed out, <line> <line>brands his cattle, numbers his piles of grain, <line> <line>sharpens fence posts or pitchforks, prepares <line> <line>umbrian trellises for the slow vine. <line> <line>then you may weave the baskets of bramble twigs <line> <line>or dip your bleating flock in the clean stream. <line> <line>often the farmer loads his little mule <line> <line>with olive oil or apples, and brings home <line> <line>a grindstone or a block of pitch from market. <line> <line>and some will stay up late beside the fire <line> <line>on winter nights, whittling torches, while <line> <line>the housewife runs the shuttle through the loom <line> <line>and comforts the long labor with her singing; <line> <line>or at the stove she simmers the new wine, <line> <line>skimming the froth with leaves. oh idle time! <line> <line>in that hale season, all their worries past, <line> <line>farmers arrange convivialities— <line> <line>as after laden ships have reached home port, <line> <line>the happy sailors load the prow with garlands. <line> <line>then is the time to gather acorns and <line> <line>laurel berries and the bloodred myrtle, <line> <line>to lay your traps for cranes and snares for buck, <line> <line>to hit the fallow deer with twisted slingshots, <line> <line>and track the long-eared hare— <line> <line>when snow is deep, and ice is on the rivers. <line> <line>v. what of the humors and the ways of autumn? <line> <line>just when the farmer wished to reap his yellow <line> <line>fields, and thresh his grain, <line> <line>i have often seen all the winds make war, <line> <line>flattening the stout crops from the very roots; <line> <line>and in the black whirlwind <line> <line>carrying off the ears and the light straw. <line> <line>and often mighty phalanxes of rain <line> <line>marched out of heaven, as the clouds <line> <line>rolled up from the sea the detestable tempest; <line> <line>then the steep aether thundered, and the deluge <line> <line>soaked the crops, filled ditches, made the rivers <line> <line>rise and roar and seethe in their spuming beds. <line> <line>the father himself in the mid stormy night <line> <line>lets the lightning go, at whose downstroke <line> <line>enormous earth quivers, wild things flee, <line> <line>and fear abases the prone hearts of men— <line> <line>as jove splits athos with his firebolt <line> <line>or rhodope or the ceraunian ridge. <line> <line>the southwind wails in sheets of rain, <line> <line>and under that great wind the groves <line> <line>lament, and the long breast of the shore is shaken. <line> <line>if you dislike to be so caught, mark well <line> <line>the moon’s phases and the weather signs; <line> <line>notice where saturn’s frigid star retires, <line> <line>mercury’s wanderings over heaven; and revere <line> <line>especially, the gods. offer to ceres <line> <line>annual sacrifice and annual worship <line> <line>in the first fair weather of the spring, <line> <line>so may your sheep grow fat and your vines fruitful, <line> <line>your sleep sweet and your mountains full of shade. <line> <line>let all the country folk come to adore her, <line> <line>and offer her libations of milk and wine; <line> <line>conduct the sacrificial lamb three times <line> <line>around the ripe field, in processional, <line> <line>with all your chorus singing out to ceres; <line> <line>and let no man lay scythe against his grain <line> <line>unless he first bind oakleaves on his head <line> <line>and make his little dance, and sing to her. <line> <line>vi. when shall we herd the cattle to the stables? <line> <line>the wind, say, rises without intermission; <line> <line>the sea gets choppy and the swell increases; <line> <line>the dry crash of boughs is heard on hills; <line> <line>the long sound of the surf becomes a tumult; <line> <line>the gusts become more frequent in the grove; <line> <line>the waves begin to fight against the keels; <line> <line>from far at sea the gulls fly shoreward crying; <line> <line>the heron leaves his favorite marsh and soars <line> <line>over the high cloud. then you will see <line> <line>beyond thin skimrack, shooting stars <line> <line>falling, the long pale tracks behind them <line> <line>whitening through the darkness of the night; <line> <line>and you’ll see straw and fallen leaves blowing. <line> <line>but when it thunders in rough boreas’ quarter, <line> <line>when east and west it thunders—every sailor <line> <line>furls his dripping sail. <line> <line>a storm should never catch you unprepared. <line> <line>aerial cranes take flight before its rising, <line> <line>the restless heifer with dilated nostrils <line> <line>sniffs the air; the squeaking hirondelle <line> <line>flits round and round the lake, and frogs, <line> <line>inveterate in their mud, croak a chorale. <line> <line>and too the ant, more frantic in his gallery, <line> <line>trundles his eggs out from their hiding place; <line> <line>the rainbow, cloud imbiber, may be seen; <line> <line>and crows go cawing from the pasture <line> <line>in a harsh throng of crepitating wings; <line> <line>the jeering jay gives out his yell for rain <line> <line>and takes a walk by himself on the dry sand. <line> <line>stormwise, the various sea-fowl, and such birds <line> <line>as grub the sweet swan river in asia, <line> <line>may be observed dousing themselves and diving <line> <line>or riding on the water, as if they wished— <line> <line>what odd exhilaration—to bathe themselves. <line> <line>vii. after a storm, clear weather and continuing <line> <line>sunny days may likewise be foretold: <line> <line>by the sharp twinkle of the stars, the moon <line> <line>rising to face her brother’s rays by day; <line> <line>no tenuous fleeces blowing in the sky, <line> <line>no halcyons, sea favorites, on the shore <line> <line>stretching out their wings in tepid sunlight; <line> <line>but mists go lower and lie on the fields, <line> <line>the owl, observing sundown from his perch, <line> <line>modulates his meaningless melancholy. <line> <line>aloft in crystal air the sparrow hawk <line> <line>chases his prey; and as she flits aside <line> <line>the fierce hawk follows screaming on the wind, <line> <line>and as he swoops, she flits aside again. <line> <line>with funereal contractions of the windpipe <line> <line>the crows produce their caws, three at a time, <line> <line>and in their high nests, pleased at i know not what, <line> <line>noise it among themselves: no doubt rejoicing <line> <line>to see their little brood after the storm, <line> <line>but not, i think, by reason of divine <line> <line>insight or superior grasp of things. <line> <line>viii. but if you carefully watch the rapid sun <line> <line>and the moon following, a fair night’s snare <line> <line>never deceives you as to next day’s weather. <line> <line>when the new moon collects a rim of light, <line> <line>if that bow be obscured with a dark vapor, <line> <line>then a great tempest is in preparation; <line> <line>if it be blushing like a virgin’s cheek, <line> <line>there will be wind; wind makes diana blush; <line> <line>if on the fourth night (most significant) <line> <line>she goes pure and unclouded through the sky, <line> <line>all that day and the following days will be, <line> <line>for one full month, exempt from rain and wind. <line> <line>the sun, too, rising and setting in the waves, <line> <line>will give you weather signs, trustworthy ones <line> <line>whether at morning or when stars come out. <line> <line>a mackerel sky over the east at sunrise <line> <line>means look out for squalls, a gale is coming, <line> <line>unfavorable to trees and plants and flocks. <line> <line>or when through denser strata the sun’s rays <line> <line>break out dimly, or aurora rises <line> <line>pale from tithonus’ crocus-colored chamber, <line> <line>alas, the vine-leaf will not shield the cluster <line> <line>in the hubbub of roof-pattering bitter hail. <line> <line>it will be well to notice sunset, too, <line> <line>for the sun’s visage then has various colors; <line> <line>bluish and dark means rain; if it be fiery <line> <line>that means an east wind; if it be dappled <line> <line>and mixed with red gold light, then you will see <line> <line>wind and rain in commotion everywhere. <line> <line>nobody can advise me, on that night, <line> <line>to cast off hawsers and put out to sea. <line> <line>but if the next day passes and the sunset <line> <line>then be clear, you need not fear the weather: <line> <line>a bright norther will sway the forest trees. <line> <line>ix. last, what the late dusk brings, and whence the fair <line> <line>clouds are blown, and secrets of the southwind <line> <line>you may learn from the sun, whose prophecies <line> <line>no man denies, seeing black insurrections, <line> <line>treacheries, and wars are told by him. <line> <line>when caesar died, the great sun pitied rome, <line> <line>so veiling his bright head, the godless time <line> <line>trembled in fear of everlasting night; <line> <line>and then were portents given of earth and ocean, <line> <line>vile dogs upon the roads, and hideous <line> <line>strange birds, and aetna quaking, and her fires <line> <line>bursting to overflow the cyclops’ fields <line> <line>with flames whirled in the air and melted stones. <line> <line>thunder of war was heard in germany <line> <line>from south to north, shaking the granite alps; <line> <line>and a voice also through the silent groves <line> <line>piercing; and apparitions wondrous pale <line> <line>were seen in dead of night. then cattle spoke <line> <line>(o horror!), streams stood still, the earth cracked open <line> <line>and tears sprang even from the temple bronze. <line> <line>the po, monarch of rivers, on his back <line> <line>spuming whole forests, raced through the lowland plains <line> <line>and bore off pens and herds; and then continually <line> <line>the viscera of beasts were thick with evil, <line> <line>blood trickled from the springs; tall towns at night <line> <line>re-echoed to the wolf-pack’s shivering howl; <line> <line>and never from pure heaven have there fallen <line> <line>so many fires, nor baleful comets burned. <line> <line>it seemed that once again the roman lines, <line> <line>alike in arms, would fight at philippi; <line> <line>and heaven permitted those thessalian fields <line> <line>to be enriched again with blood of ours. <line> <line>some future day, perhaps, in that country, <line> <line>a farmer with his plow will turn the ground, <line> <line>and find the javelins eaten thin with rust, <line> <line>or knock the empty helmets with his mattock <line> <line>and wonder, digging up those ancient bones. <line> <line>paternal gods! ancestors! mother vesta! <line> <line>you that guard tiber and the palatine! <line> <line>now that long century is overthrown, <line> <line>let not this young man fail to give us peace! <line> <line>long enough beneath your rule, o caesar, <line> <line>heaven has hated us and all those triumphs <line> <line>where justice was thrown down—so many wars, <line> <line>so many kinds of wickedness! no honor <line> <line>rendered the plow, but the fields gone to ruin, <line> <line>the country-folk made homeless, and their scythes <line> <line>beaten to straight swords on the blowing forge! <line> <line>war from the euphrates to germany; <line> <line>ruptured engagements, violence of nations, <line> <line>and impious mars raging the whole world over— <line> <line>as when a four horsed chariot rears away <line> <line>plunging from the barrier, and runs wild, <line> <line>heedless of the reins or the charioteer. <line> <line>terrorizers of themselves, laughers in <line> <line>language and priests of any mystery— <line> <line>not by authority. <line> <line> what of the revered <line> <line>historian, the painstaking public man? <line> <line>his dusty briefcase worn to a splitting bulge, <line> <line>the scholar descending from the library <line> <line>smiles at the doves, and at the glowing grass. <line> <line>letters gone frail and yellow in their strings <line> <line>spill fuzz and dust from the stuck folds: <line> <line>it might be inferred from what the ambassador <line> <line>wrote to his daughter in virginia <line> <line>that others were privy to the situation. <line> <line>these judges are gentle and well-cultivated <line> <line>honorable stylists, penetrating men, <line> <line>mirrors of duplicity and bewilderment, <line> <line>mirrors of magnificent deep-rooted structural <line> <line>policy and implacable miscarriage. <line> <line>the documents are all photostated, the files <line> <line>arranged. let humane logic <line> <line>guide them in the wilderness of the state. <line> <line>the pallid husbandman grunts at his fields, <line> <line>sells his new lambs in the damp of march, <line> <line>thumbs the slick catalogue of the mail order <line> <line>house for ginghams for the girls of summer; <line> <line>chews with the county agent at the gate. <line> <line>he will be ruddy as the sun goes over, <line> <line>the clouds go over, the tractor shudders on <line> <line>through the high fields. the piling west will grow <line> <line>fractious with lightning, the wild branches bend, <line> <line>curtains blow out like goodbye handkerchiefs <line> <line>hilarious in the gloomy wind. autumn <line> <line>comes with marriages to the aging house, <line> <line>winter comes with comforts and old death. <line> <line>still the farmer’s dull hand holds the seed;

that it’s imperative that i accept death when it arrives, after <line> <line>affirming life as fully as i can. it’s too easy, and stupid, to be simplistically <line> <line> <line> <line>oppositional. and to not know that people can ruin anything, but <line> <line>that the substantial things have value of themselves, is foolish. i don’t want to stop <line> <line> <line> <line>at my own ignorance and lack of forbearance. i don’t believe in the west <line> <line>on its own. as michael says, the only thing that makes sense here <line> <line> <line> <line>is love. i have everything i could possibly ever want or need for now. more books <line> <line>will come, more music too. and love is immeasurable <line> <line> <line> <line>when it’s real. i am so grateful to have more waking time <line> <line>on the weekends. i plan on making breakfast for brenda <line> <line> <line> <line>every saturday and sunday that i can <line> <line>from now on. early. i see gardens in the future of our household. <line> <line> <line> <line>and i wonder about a great spirit. what does the name matter? i see the stones that live <line> <line>without water. i see the smoke that cleanses my vision, and a network of consciousness, <line> <line> <line> <line>with each node another, on and on that way to the depths. my thinking will never <line> <line>grasp it all <line> <line> <line> <line>because of that recursively created network of interior life. my thinking stops <line> <line>then, barely able to contain the spherical and vast darkness <line> <line> <line> <line>from which all light arises. that’s why what i see is dark. it is brilliant <line> <line>in its darkness. like onyx and flint. i can only talk around what i’ve seen <line> <line> <line> <line>the past couple of weeks. it reframes, completely, the rest of my creative <line> <line>life and the rest of my days. all i aim to do now is to focus my attention, <line> <line> <line> <line>so that i can see it all again in retrospect. so that i can read <line> <line>and gather more tools for understanding it. so that i understand myself, <line> <line> <line> <line>and something of the world, and love, and so that i help others. geodon <line> <line>will not erase it. i’ve seen it already, many times. it is my natural state. <line> <line> <line> <line>i no longer see it as only hallucination. it is a way of being. a way that i can flesh <line> <line>out, here. slowly. carefully. and as i do, its destructive powers, <line> <line> <line> <line>which are massive and righteous, will subside. as it will know that it is being <line> <line>given to the world. because it belongs to all. and all will be there soon. <line> <line> <line> <line>there are signs already. because to see it is to break, unless one knows something <line> <line>of love. it makes lsd <line> <line> <line> <line>small. it is god and the universe as one. <line> <line>i am not the first to see it. but i am a person <line> <line> <line> <line>given a chance <line> <line>to write it, letter by letter, slowly, in terms of the light of my ignorance <line> <line> <line> <line>to see more fully <line> <line>what i do not know. i do not offer anything <line> <line> <line> <line>but poems. but it breaks through <line> <line>my mouth to arrive at the hearts of the world, at the hearts of the horses <line> <line> <line> <line>of the world, to allow us all to speak in silence. it is not god or the universe. <line> <line>it is one as all in you. because i cannot see through myself <line> <line> <line> <line>without it. i see clearly <line> <line>that the sun will not arrive <line> <line> <line> <line>in this new weather. but that the moon <line> <line>will take its place. i see clearly that the sun is there <line> <line> <line> <line>to bring meaning to the sky, and that the earth is more full <line> <line>with the light of the world <line> <line> <line> <line>extinguished for a brilliant view of wilderness. this is a view <line> <line>that extends through opposites <line> <line> <line> <line>and arrives at a single body <line> <line>to witness this song. and this song is not the answer <line> <line> <line> <line>that you believe in, because one day <line> <line>i will speak to you again <line> <line> <line> <line>in the rain <line> <line>and show you <line> <line> <line> <line>that i do not know. because knowledge <line> <line>belongs to the earth. and the earth makes everything <line> <line> <line> <line>i know. and now that there is less and less freedom <line> <line>from coercion in a moneyed world, and now that claire, <line> <line> <line> <line>a friend, is moving on to be christ in her own way, now <line> <line>that guénon continues to call me to understand <line> <line> <line> <line>my ignorance, to depart again <line> <line>from the friends at kuna yala, where i helped with the water, <line> <line> <line> <line>with brenda watching over me <line> <line>from a hammock between palms, now that panamá <line> <line> <line> <line>calls again to give me a union <line> <line>of the world, in more than two ways, <line> <line> <line> <line>and to distinguish from the surface of these times, i <line> <line>receive <line> <line> <line> <line>a call to awaken in the snow. i receive a call to acknowledge <line> <line>that geodon has planted itself <line> <line> <line> <line>with capital <line> <line>in my consciousness, but that the world <line> <line> <line> <line>is stronger than to balance itself <line> <line>from the ozone and people alone. we are not erased, and we <line> <line> <line> <line>do not control the earth. geodon <line> <line>is an act of kindness, an agreement <line> <line> <line> <line>to live this life <line> <line>in a way that arrives <line> <line> <line> <line>with the weather. it may continue <line> <line>for the rest of my life, or it may not. i will not be afraid again <line> <line> <line> <line>to see things as i do, and i will not <line> <line>seek out the truth, intentionally, without some kind of agreement <line> <line> <line> <line>with this custom. because that is a way, for now, <line> <line>that i speak. and it is useful, though better left <line> <line> <line> <line>invisible. and the name, geodon, brings trouble, i can see <line> <line>through it enough, with enough love in my life, to believe <line> <line> <line> <line>in the end of the reign of the anti-christ (not obama). i need to learn again <line> <line>to be and to write. but to deliver <line> <line> <line> <line>what i saw <line> <line>i must return <line> <line> <line> <line>to the explosion of my inner life. to start with, otherwise and generally, i see <line> <line>only outlines. creation manifests <line> <line> <line> <line>from every direction, in an infinity <line> <line>of dimensions. most of us <line> <line> <line> <line>spend most of our energy <line> <line>conscious of a very few of these dimensions. imagine <line> <line> <line> <line>more than the greatest works of art <line> <line>manifesting endlessly <line> <line> <line> <line>from more directions than one can possibly count <line> <line>every micro second, timelessly. it’s glorious. <line> <line> <line> <line>and the only way to see it with any balance <line> <line>is impeccably, ethically, compassionately, and with at least an aim <line> <line> <line> <line>toward the divine. it is the divine. god and the universe <line> <line>spoke to me. it is all, always, speaking to us. and what it says <line> <line> <line> <line>is endless <line> <line>it brings wholeness <line> <line> <line> <line>to the precious moment. it goes away <line> <line>when one tries to pin it down, as i do. i say less and less <line> <line> <line> <line>as i try to describe it. it is endlessly <line> <line>generative. it is good <line> <line> <line> <line>but pitiless and merciful. it demands of us <line> <line>that we arrive. and now that the thinking manifests <line> <line> <line> <line>in a way that allows <line> <line>for union and a bridge, in a way that avoids <line> <line> <line> <line>easy condemnation, a thinking that reveals <line> <line>the links toward light <line> <line> <line> <line>in motion, a primordial <line> <line>form of being <line> <line> <line> <line>in a new world that needs no one <line> <line>to believe in it, a vast chasm <line> <line> <line> <line>in what a bureaucracy of thought <line> <line>tries to pin us down with, the hole in time <line> <line> <line> <line>that allows us to be free <line> <line>is here, we know it. all of us <line> <line> <line> <line>can see through delusion. there is no road <line> <line>in the aftermath of earthquakes, no need for the time <line> <line> <line> <line>to extinguish the elements, no person <line> <line>locked to your heart <line> <line> <line> <line>in the morning, no water to drink <line> <line>without thirst, no air is necessary to breathe <line> <line> <line> <line>under the water of seeing, no <line> <line>need for the earth to do anything <line> <line> <line> <line>other than revolve, in this <line> <line>new light. space <line> <line> <line> <line>undoes our links <line> <line>to the immovable. we deliver <line> <line> <line> <line>the undone to the plains <line> <line>and see what the harvest <line> <line> <line> <line>will fill with seed. the whole <line> <line>does not exist <line> <line> <line> <line>within outlines. all we can do <line> <line>is move to it. the music <line> <line> <line> <line>is unheard of <line> <line>in this world. it exists <line> <line> <line> <line>without origin. it is otherworldly, <line> <line>primordial, and gentle. it vibrates, <line> <line> <line> <line>equally, in the lamb, in <line> <line>the lotus, in <line> <line> <line> <line>the stones—there is no place <line> <line>unknown to it. it is <line> <line> <line> <line>music, and nothing more, <line> <line>and nothing less. it is that <line> <line> <line> <line>everywhere possible. it is harmonious <line> <line>infinitely, and allows for any sound. to some <line> <line> <line> <line>it might seem like noise, but that <line> <line>is only the part. to achieve it <line> <line> <line> <line>one need only listen. i cannot always <line> <line>hear it, but i have <line> <line> <line> <line>heard it. and now <line> <line>in my new mind, i listen for it <line> <line> <line> <line>undaunted and silent. i feel it filling <line> <line>my body with love. sometimes <line> <line> <line> <line>i have horrific thoughts. but i am learning <line> <line>that these are but strong notes <line> <line> <line> <line>in the fullness <line> <line>of the music <line> <line> <line> <line>of my new mind. i can’t always hear the song, <line> <line>but i feel it now. it makes all context <line> <line> <line> <line>vast. i will receive it <line> <line>as long as it is here. i will not push <line> <line> <line> <line>one way or the other with it. it is a fullness <line> <line>and does not want to be made <line> <line> <line> <line>into a force. it is a force <line> <line>without me, and only to the degree <line> <line> <line> <line>to which this is true. no longer being able <line> <line>to receive it <line> <line> <line> <line>will imply a failure <line> <line>of my imagination, of my ethics, <line> <line> <line> <line>and my spirit. there is no way <line> <line>to hold on to it. it serves <line> <line> <line> <line>no one. and it includes us all. to continue to receive it <line> <line>more fully <line> <line> <line> <line>i grow. this implies <line> <line>the world. it implies clarity. it implies <line> <line> <line> <line>motion. but it rests motionlessly. if i have a softness in my voice <line> <line>it is caused by this music. when i don’t <line> <line> <line> <line>i feel less. my voice can be loud <line> <line>to receive it, but this loudness <line> <line> <line> <line>cannot be yoked <line> <line>in outlines. there is nothing i can do. <line> <line> <line> <line>there is nothing to expect. i can only <line> <line>let it go. and i can only be afraid <line> <line> <line> <line>of the horror of my thoughts <line> <line>without this music. but now that i know <line> <line> <line> <line>a taste of it, i have <line> <line>hope. good people <line> <line> <line> <line>feed it. i haven’t always known <line> <line>what to do with it and others. but now <line> <line> <line> <line>i am a little less confused <line> <line>about this. this is due <line> <line> <line> <line>to buddhism, the little that i know <line> <line>of its practice. and to love. but it does not stop <line> <line> <line> <line>at my experience. i am ignorant <line> <line>and cannot offer knowledge. except this <line> <line> <line> <line>music <line> <line>does not require knowledge. i’m not sure <line> <line> <line> <line>what it requires. it requires <line> <line>to be received, but does not need us. is there a pact <line> <line> <line> <line>between humanity <line> <line>and god? i don’t know. is there a god? <line> <line> <line> <line>i don’t know. i’m not sure the question <line> <line>is enough on its own. or maybe it is, if god <line> <line> <line> <line>is not limited by concept. and concept <line> <line>seems to be only a note in this song. problems <line> <line> <line> <line>feed it. “love <line> <line>is the absence of fear.” and “love <line> <line> <line> <line>believes all things, <line> <line>yet is never deceived.” i aim <line> <line> <line> <line>to see through my delusions. i aim <line> <line>to be one of many, a small voice <line> <line> <line> <line>in the song of the world. i rest <line> <line>in silence <line> <line> <line> <line>as i always have. “to have a view <line> <line>as vast as the sky <line> <line> <line> <line>and as fine <line> <line>as a grain of sand.” all beings <line> <line> <line> <line>want to be loved <line> <line>and to be free <line> <line> <line> <line>from suffering. we strive <line> <line>diligently <line> <line> <line> <line>to learn the vast expanse <line> <line>and the laser pointed focus <line> <line> <line> <line>of this gift. remember that light <line> <line>makes us. and that in this <line> <line> <line> <line>new world, more and more <line> <line>is made of light. and if that is the case, <line> <line> <line> <line>we move to move <line> <line>the light of the world. someday, <line> <line> <line> <line>perhaps, we will move <line> <line>the light <line> <line> <line> <line>of the computer world. only the compassionate <line> <line>and true <line> <line> <line> <line>will be able to do so. because only they <line> <line>can be selfless enough <line> <line> <line> <line>to let it move through them. i am not there <line> <line>to move it <line> <line> <line> <line>but i saw this. long ago. briefly. i was offered <line> <line>a glimpse. it is utterly simple and beyond <line> <line> <line> <line>thought. there is hope. intention <line> <line>is a thought. so one <line> <line> <line> <line>sees. i cannot tangle <line> <line>myself <line> <line> <line> <line>in the line. but only to bridge. that is part of why <line> <line>it will all move. but i cannot wait <line> <line> <line> <line>until that is possible <line> <line>to become. i can wait <line> <line> <line> <line>eternally and actively in the world <line> <line>to remain <line> <line> <line> <line>still. with the calm and expansive <line> <line>link <line> <line> <line> <line>that allows us to live, so preciously <line> <line>together, i see through <line> <line> <line> <line>the trouble that startles me, every moment <line> <line>and allow the seeing <line> <line> <line> <line>of my inner eye <line> <line>to burn through it. i do not remember <line> <line> <line> <line>what zyprexa was like any longer. except that it seems <line> <line>i have more to work with now, with my mind. and these <line> <line> <line> <line>words are plain, so as to be careful in this new place. i see <line> <line>that they do not break open my heart, as i read. and for that <line> <line> <line> <line>i relinquish this poem, and allow it to be only <line> <line>a mark on the road to further inquiry. i allow it to see <line> <line> <line> <line>as i have made a vow to bridge, that my life <line> <line>aims to be whole, even in the face of potential <line> <line> <line> <line>catastrophes, i grow more and more <line> <line>to accept death as it arrives, to allow it to soften me, <line> <line> <line> <line>and to transform me as i have been transformed through geodon, only <line> <line>to know that there is an isthmus, and that it is eternal. only that there is one <line> <line> <line> <line>heart to allow myself to speak <line> <line>in the storms of tribulation, as one speaks <line> <line> <line> <line>to allow the teamwork of the fabric of need <line> <line>of the bird malingerer to see this <line> <line> <line> <line>in the aftermath of one who has died. like a bicycle never once <line> <line>together enough to ride, i see this word here, again, to the removal <line> <line> <line> <line>of a people, to the homeland of union and pace, to the isthmus <line> <line>of a double link, one ocean to another, one continent <line> <line> <line> <line>to another, to the only union (even as it may be erased in my history), the place <line> <line>of one heart to allow the song to continue through conflict <line> <line> <line> <line>as she saw it then, one time, far away, when i hadn’t known yet, that this <line> <line>would be timeless. and there is one to it there to see it there, to allow <line> <line> <line> <line>it there to become and to see there as one is there to see <line> <line>and to allow one to arrive with it there and to see, and to be one with it <line> <line> <line> <line>there as one is there to be with it. and to see there as one is there to believe <line> <line>as it is one to believe it there <line> <line> <line> <line>and to see it there as one with the soil and the air and the light and rain <line> <line>and to be there with one to be there one with it there once again, and to see it there <line> <line> <line> <line>and to believe as there is one there to believe it there again and to see. and to see <line> <line>there as one is there to believe as it is there again <line> <line> <line> <line>and to see there as one is there to arrive and to be with it <line> <line>there and to see it there once again and to see it there again <line> <line> <line> <line>and to
