""saturn, look up!—though wherefore, poor old king? i have no comfort for thee, no not one: i cannot say, ""o wherefore sleepest thou?"" for heaven is parted from thee, and the earth knows thee not, thus afflicted, for a god; and ocean too, with all its solemn noise, has from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the air is emptied of thine hoary majesty. thy thunder, conscious of the new command, rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house; and thy sharp lightning in unpractis'd hands scorches and burns our once serene domain. o aching time! o moments big as years! all as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth, and press it so upon our weary griefs that unbelief has not a space to breathe. saturn, sleep on:—o thoughtless, why did i thus violate thy slumbrous solitude? why should i ope thy melancholy eyes? saturn, sleep on! while at thy feet i weep."" as when, upon a tranced summer-night, those green-rob'd senators of mighty woods, tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars, dream, and so dream all night without a stir, save from one gradual solitary gust which comes upon the silence, and dies off, as if the ebbing air had but one wave; so came these words and went; the while in tears she touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground, just where her falling hair might be outspread a soft and silken mat for saturn's feet. one moon, with alteration slow, had shed her silver seasons four upon the night, and still these two were postured motionless, like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern; the frozen god still couchant on the earth, and the sad goddess weeping at his feet: until at length old saturn lifted up his faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone, and all the gloom and sorrow of the place, and that fair kneeling goddess; and then spake, as with a palsied tongue, and while his beard shook horrid with such aspen-malady: ""o tender spouse of gold hyperion, thea, i feel thee ere i see thy face; look up, and let me see our doom in it; look up, and tell me if this feeble shape is saturn's; tell me, if thou hear'st the voice of saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow, naked and bare of its great diadem, peers like the front of saturn. who had power to make me desolate? whence came the strength? how was it nurtur'd to such bursting forth, while fate seem'd strangled in my nervous grasp? but it is so, and i am smother'd up, and buried from all godlike exercise of influence benign on planets pale, of admonitions to the winds and seas, of peaceful sway above man's harvesting, and all those acts which deity supreme doth ease its heart of love in.—i am gone away from my own bosom: i have left my strong identity, my real self, somewhere between the throne, and where i sit here on this spot of earth. search, thea, search! open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round upon all space: space starr'd, and lorn of light; space region'd with life-air; and barren void; spaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell.— search, thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest a certain shape or shadow, making way with wings or chariot fierce to repossess a heaven he lost erewhile: it must—it must be of ripe progress—saturn must be king. yes, there must be a golden victory; there must be gods thrown down, and trumpets blown of triumph calm, and hymns of festival upon the gold clouds metropolitan, voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir of strings in hollow shells; and there shall be beautiful things made new, for the surprise of the sky-children; i will give command: thea! thea! thea! where is saturn?"" this passion lifted him upon his feet, and made his hands to struggle in the air, his druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat, his eyes to fever out, his voice to cease. he stood, and heard not thea's sobbing deep; a little time, and then again he snatch'd utterance thus.—""but cannot i create? cannot i form? cannot i fashion forth another world, another universe, to overbear and crumble this to nought? where is another chaos? where?""—that word found way unto olympus, and made quake the rebel three.—thea was startled up, and in her bearing was a sort of hope, as thus she quick-voic'd spake, yet full of awe. ""this cheers our fallen house: come to our friends, o saturn! come away, and give them heart; i know the covert, from thence came i hither."" thus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went with backward footing through the shade a space: he follow'd, and she turn'd to lead the way through aged boughs, that yielded like the mist which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest. meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed, more sorrow like to this, and such like woe, too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe: the titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound, groan'd for the old allegiance once more, and listen'd in sharp pain for saturn's voice. but one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept his sov'reignty, and rule, and majesty;— blazing hyperion on his orbed fire still sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up from man to the sun's god; yet unsecure: for as among us mortals omens drear fright and perplex, so also shuddered he— not at dog's howl, or gloom-bird's hated screech, or the familiar visiting of one upon the first toll of his passing bell, or prophesyings of the midnight lamp; but horrors, portion'd to a giant nerve, oft made hyperion ache. his palace bright bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold, and touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks, glar'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts, arches, and domes, and fiery galleries; and all its curtains of aurorian clouds flush'd angerly: while sometimes eagle's wings, unseen before by gods or wondering men, darken'd the place; and neighing steeds were heard, not heard before by gods or wondering men. also, when he would taste the spicy wreaths of incense, breath'd aloft from sacred hills, instead of sweets, his ample palate took savour of poisonous brass and metal sick: and so, when harbour'd in the sleepy west, after the full completion of fair day,— for rest divine upon exalted couch and slumber in the arms of melody, he pac'd away the pleasant hours of ease with stride colossal, on from hall to hall; while far within each aisle and deep recess, his winged minions in close clusters stood, amaz'd and full of fear; like anxious men who on wide plains gather in panting troops, when earthquakes jar their battlements and towers. even now, while saturn, rous'd from icy trance, went step for step with thea through the woods, hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear, came slope upon the threshold of the west; then, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope in smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes, blown by the serious zephyrs, gave of sweet and wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies; and like a rose in vermeil tint and shape, in fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye, that inlet to severe magnificence stood full blown, for the god to enter in. he enter'd, but he enter'd full of wrath; his flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels, and gave a roar, as if of earthly fire, that scar'd away the meek ethereal hours and made their dove-wings tremble. on he flared, from stately nave to nave, from vault to vault, through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light, and diamond-paved lustrous long arcades, until he reach'd the great main cupola; there standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot, and from the basements deep to the high towers jarr'd his own golden region; and before the quavering thunder thereupon had ceas'd, his voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb, to this result: ""o dreams of day and night! o monstrous forms! o effigies of pain! o spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom! o lank-ear'd phantoms of black-weeded pools! why do i know ye? why have i seen ye? why is my eternal essence thus distraught to see and to behold these horrors new? saturn is fallen, am i too to fall? am i to leave this haven of my rest, this cradle of my glory, this soft clime, this calm luxuriance of blissful light, these crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes, of all my lucent empire? it is left deserted, void, nor any haunt of mine. the blaze, the splendour, and the symmetry, i cannot see—but darkness, death and darkness. even here, into my centre of repose, the shady visions come to domineer, insult, and blind, and stifle up my pomp.— fall!—no, by tellus and her briny robes! over the fiery frontier of my realms i will advance a terrible right arm shall scare that infant thunderer, rebel jove, and bid old saturn take his throne again.""— he spake, and ceas'd, the while a heavier threat held struggle with his throat but came not forth; for as in the theatres of crowded men hubbub increases more they call out ""hush!"" so at hyperion's words the phantoms pale bestirr'd themselves, thrice horrible and cold; and from the mirror'd level where he stood a mist arose, as from a scummy marsh. at this, through all his bulk an agony crept gradual, from the feet unto the crown, like a lithe serpent vast and muscular making slow way, with head and neck convuls'd from over-strained might. releas'd, he fled to the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours before the dawn in season due should blush, he breath'd fierce breath against the sleepy portals, clear'd them of heavy vapours, burst them wide suddenly on the ocean's chilly streams. the planet orb of fire, whereon he rode each day from east to west the heavens through, spun round in sable curtaining of clouds; nor therefore veiled quite, blindfold, and hid, but ever and anon the glancing spheres, circles, and arcs, and broad-belting colure, glow'd through, and wrought upon the muffling dark sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep up to the zenith,—hieroglyphics old which sages and keen-ey'd astrologers then living on the earth, with labouring thought won from the gaze of many centuries: now lost, save what we find on remnants huge of stone, or marble swart; their import gone, their wisdom long since fled.—two wings this orb possess'd for glory, two fair argent wings, ever exalted at the god's approach: and now, from forth the gloom their plumes immense rose, one by one, till all outspreaded were; while still the dazzling globe maintain'd eclipse, awaiting for hyperion's command. fain would he have commanded, fain took throne and bid the day begin, if but for change. he might not:—no, though a primeval god: the sacred seasons might not be disturb'd. therefore the operations of the dawn stay'd in their birth, even as here 'tis told. those silver wings expanded sisterly, eager to sail their orb; the porches wide open'd upon the dusk demesnes of night; and the bright titan, phrenzied with new woes, unus'd to bend, by hard compulsion bent his spirit to the sorrow of the time; and all along a dismal rack of clouds, upon the boundaries of day and night, he stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint. there as he lay, the heaven with its stars look'd down on him with pity, and the voice of coelus, from the universal space, thus whisper'd low and solemn in his ear. ""o brightest of my children dear, earth-born and sky-engendered, son of mysteries all unrevealed even to the powers which met at thy creating; at whose joys and palpitations sweet, and pleasures soft, i, c{oe}lus, wonder, how they came and whence; and at the fruits thereof what shapes they be, distinct, and visible; symbols divine, manifestations of that beauteous life diffus'd unseen throughout eternal space: of these new-form'd art thou, oh brightest child! of these, thy brethren and the goddesses! there is sad feud among ye, and rebellion of son against his sire. i saw him fall, i saw my first-born tumbled from his throne! to me his arms were spread, to me his voice found way from forth the thunders round his head! pale wox i, and in vapours hid my face art thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is: for i have seen my sons most unlike gods. divine ye were created, and divine in sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb'd, unruffled, like high gods, ye liv'd and ruled: now i behold in you fear, hope, and wrath; actions of rage and passion; even as i see them, on the mortal world beneath, in men who die.—this is the grief, o son! sad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall! yet do thou strive; as thou art capable, as thou canst move about, an evident god; and canst oppose to each malignant hour ethereal presence:—i am but a voice; my life is but the life of winds and tides, no more than winds and tides can i avail:— but thou canst.—be thou therefore in the van of circumstance; yea, seize the arrow's barb before the tense string murmur.—to the earth! for there thou wilt find saturn and his woes. meanwhile i will keep watch on thy bright sun, and of thy seasons be a careful nurse.""— ere half this region-whisper had come down, hyperion arose, and on the stars lifted his curved lids, and kept them wide until it ceas'd; and still he kept them wide: and still they were the same bright, patient stars. then with a slow incline of his broad breast, like to a diver in the pearly seas, forward he stoop'd over the airy shore, and plung'd all noiseless into the deep night. <line>","living,disappointment & failure,nature,stars, planets, heavens,social commentaries,war & conflict,mythology & folklore,greek & roman mythology,heroes & patriotism"

country. <line> <line>i had some good ideas in those days. <line> <line>well, what we did was this. we had boxes <line> <line>precisely built to every size of canvas. <line> <line>we put the boxes in the basement and waited. <line> <line>when word came that the germans were coming in, <line> <line>we got each painting put in the proper box <line> <line>and out of leningrad in less than a week. <line> <line>they were stored somewhere in southern russia. <line> <line>but what we did, you see, besides the boxes <line> <line>waiting in the basement, which was fine, <line> <line>a grand idea, you’ll agree, and it saved the art— <line> <line>but what we did was leave the frames hanging, <line> <line>so after the war it would be a simple thing <line> <line>to put the paintings back where they belonged. <line> <line>nothing will seem surprised or sad again <line> <line>compared to those imperious, vacant frames. <line> <line>well, the staff stayed on to clean the rubble <line> <line>after the daily bombardments. we didn’t dream— <line> <line>you know it lasted nine hundred days. <line> <line>much of the roof was lost and snow would lie <line> <line>sometimes a foot deep on this very floor, <line> <line>but the walls stood firm and hardly a frame fell. <line> <line>here is the story, now, that i want to tell you. <line> <line>early one day, a dark december morning, <line> <line>we came on three young soldiers waiting outside, <line> <line>pacing and swinging their arms against the cold. <line> <line>they told us this: in three homes far from here <line> <line>all dreamed of one day coming to leningrad <line> <line>to see the hermitage, as they supposed <line> <line>every soviet citizen dreamed of doing. <line> <line>now they had been sent to defend the city, <line> <line>a turn of fortune the three could hardly believe. <line> <line>i had to tell them there was nothing to see <line> <line>but hundreds and hundreds of frames where the paintings had hung. <line> <line>“please, sir,” one of them said, “let us see them.” <line> <line>and so we did. it didn’t seem any stranger <line> <line>than all of us being here in the first place, <line> <line>inside such a building, strolling in snow. <line> <line>we led them around most of the major rooms, <line> <line>what they could take the time for, wall by wall. <line> <line>now and then we stopped and tried to tell them <line> <line>part of what they would see if they saw the paintings. <line> <line>i told them how those colors would come together, <line> <line>described a brushstroke here, a dollop there, <line> <line>mentioned a model and why she seemed to pout <line> <line>and why this painter got the roses wrong. <line> <line>the next day a dozen waited for us, <line> <line>then thirty or more, gathered in twos and threes. <line> <line>each of us took a group in a different direction: <line> <line>castagno, caravaggio, brueghel, cézanne, matisse, <line> <line>orozco, manet, da vinci, goya, vermeer, <line> <line>picasso, uccello, your whistler, wood, and gropper. <line> <line>we pointed to more details about the paintings, <line> <line>i venture to say, than if we had had them there, <line> <line>some unexpected use of line or light, <line> <line>balance or movement, facing the cluster of faces <line> <line>the same way we’d done it every morning <line> <line>before the war, but then we didn’t pay <line> <line>so much attention to what we talked about. <line> <line>people could see for themselves. as a matter of fact <line> <line>we’d sometimes said our lines as if they were learned <line> <line>out of a book, with hardly a look at the paintings. <line> <line>but now the guide and the listeners paid attention <line> <line>to everything—the simple differences <line> <line>between the first and post-impressionists, <line> <line>romantic and heroic, shade and shadow. <line> <line>maybe this was a way to forget the war <line> <line>a little while. maybe more than that. <line> <line>whatever it was, the people continued to come. <line> <line>it came to be called the unseen collection. <line> <line>here. here is the story i

cock of the head. my god, they paid attention. <line> <line>after the siege was lifted and the germans left <line> <line>and the roof was fixed and the paintings were in their places, <line> <line>the blind never came again. not like before. <line> <line>this seems strange, but what i think it was, <line> <line>they couldn’t see the paintings anymore. <line> <line>they could still have listened,

11033,2290,"<line> <line>the first sentence is a sentence about writing. the second sentence tells you it's alright to lose interest. you might be one of those people who sits back in his or her chair without interest, and this would have been the third sentence you would have read. the fourth sentence, what does that say, that says something about how i genuinely feel, even if it no longer matters how i genuinely feel, that has not even become the topic of another book. the fifth sentence says that that was left by the wayside because it was such a variable thing. that's what the sixth sentence said, and says, that it sits there still, varying, changing its colors, etc., the army of ancient rome marches by, they think it is some sort of tomb and display their eagle insignia. the seventh sentence ill conceals its surprise that i should have tried to make it all look so far away. the eight sentence is therefore a meditation on something close at hand. the ninth sentence is a means of approach. in the tenth sentence i discover i am staring at a list of things i have done written in blue pencil on brown paper. in the eleventh sentence i draw a one-eyed duck on the paper beside the list. in the twelfth sentence i circle one of the numbers on the list and i start to feel nervous. in the thirteenth sentence i realize i have chosen something. in the fourteenth sentence i decide i will read my choice aloud. in the fifteenth sentence i stall by saying the words ""i don't have a choice."" in the sixteenth sentence i stall again by thinking about the obelisk on the upper east side in central park and how it is called ""cleopatra's needle,"" and how around the base of the ""needle"" there are metal supports in the shape of crustaceans, i think they are crabs in fact but sometimes that word is slightly obscene so i consider not writing it. in the seventeenth sentence i think some more about the kinds of joke that employ that word and whether it is worth thinking about such jokes, as it does alter the genre of what you are writing if such things are allowed to be thought as a part of it. the lawns of the park were very green in summer, and it is early summer right now, right as i think to think this, and this is the first time i have lived in new york city for a full year in ten years, this is what i tell as the nineteenth sentence. in the twentieth sentence i recall the list and resolve again to look at it. in the twentifirst sentence i misspell twenty-first with two ""i""s. in the twenty-second sentence i look down at the list, i have circled no. 18759351 on the list. in the twentisecond sentence i misspell twenty-second using an ""i"" again. in the twenty-third sentence i read what is written next to no. 18759351, it says, ""he was sitting on a bench...,"" but at this moment a breeze enters in through the open window, lifting the page and you begin reading another line, the words, ""and you hand in the application and it takes three months and...."" in the twenty-fourth sentence you can see me set the page down as another person walks through the door. i turn off the electronic typewriter and scroll out the page and place it facedown on the desk and i cover it with a notebook you weren't aware was also there on the desk. now you can see it, it is almost the exact same color as the surface of the desk and now you can see it. these were the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth sentences, respectively, it is the lot of the twenty-seventh sentence to have to announce that. in the twenty-eighth sentence a cloud passes over the apartment on its way into space. in the twenty-ninth sentence, i think, next year this will be the number of my age. the thirtieth sentence is all about the speed at which time is passing. in the thirty-first sentence i won't care anymore, i'll see that reality only accrues to itself and does not have to mean something. in the thirty-second sentence i want you to agree with me. things happen by chance, and what montaigne pleads with us to believe, in an essay, is that fortune makes herself known in the act of reading, there is much that i could not have intended which is yet here, i forget exactly how this goes, this being the thirty-third sentence. i sit down beside myself in the thirty-fourth sentence and say to myself, smiling, even small numbers are big. this is the working of time, the thirty-fifth sentence joins in saying this, too, once one has crossed the years their number does not matter. but what i was trying to get across was, i think in sentence thirty-six, that maybe you could not have done things earlier, maybe it just was not possible in those days for whichever reasons. you spend the thirty-seventh sentence attempting to spell those reasons out. you fall asleep, and in the thirty-eighth sentence you dream about a room. the room is a classroom in which you are alone, says sentence number thirty-nine, the windows have been left open and a sentence can be read on the blackboard. in the fortieth sentence you have to force yourself to go on. descartes's dream, you remember, in sentence forty-one, provided a quote supposedly from ausonius. this is the forty-second sentence, est et non. then i think it is safe to say that something begins to happen, sentence forty-three tells us. sentence forty-four says that you should forgive. sentence forty-five says that you remember this number as having been particularly beautiful when worn by your mother. sentence forty-six says the figures move away. sentence forty-seven is a sentence about what loneliness names itself in the paradoxical presence of others. sentence forty-eight says it has a name. sentence forty-nine says that i cannot remember this name. sentence fifty says that i go back and try and live there in that moment when i was saying the name. i say, ""happiness."" this was sentence fifty-one. that was sentence fifty-two. sentence fifty-four is a sentence about how there is too much of so many things, there is too much of all the words, but the world runs on underneath them and i keep on imagining how you could have heard me, how you could not have heard me. sentence fifty-five is a sentence about picking up the phone. sentence fifty-six is a sentence about picking up a small cellular phone but not using it and willing the phone to ring on its own. the gray cotton of the sweatshirt i wear is a warm cotton in sentence fifty-seven. in sentence fifty-eight i decide to keep on saying the numbers. in sentence fifty-nine i hold the page up to the light and see the type on the other side show through, in sentence sixty you start to believe me. in sentence sixty-one i start to go back to the beginning. i wonder if i should worry. the world is full of pauses, the world is full with continuations, says sentence sixty-three. i let sentence sixty-four go. in sentence sixty-five it occurs to me that i concern myself here with something that ought not to be touched. sentence sixty-six is a guess that this is the mystery of counting, that it goes on and means itself without having a meaning. i count the people in the distance i can see from my window in sentence sixty-seven. in sentence sixty-eight the breeze has a sweet smell. in sentence sixty-nine, it turns the last week of may in the year 2008. sentence seventy concerns the lack of what i wanted, in my own mind, to be saying. in sentence seventy-one i'm going so far as to ask you if you can see this, how much of what i thought lay before me remained in the distance. in sentence seventy-two there is a hill there. in sentence seventy-three we see flowers open their faces and then black snakes slide down the face of the hill. in sentence seventy-four there is still nothing. in sentence seventy-five the moon changes place with the sun. in sentence seventy-six this takes place again, only now it is day. in sentence seventy-seven it is still day. in sentence seventy-eight it is still day. why do you think about tragedy, sentence seventy-nine wants to know, since it is the least likely thing to happen. sentence eighty will eventually come to me and want to know what i am doing with myself. sentence eighty-one reminds me to expect this question. in sentence eighty-two something changes. i stay up two nights running and in the morning the sidewalk seems to rise up and meet my feet underneath my feet. sentence eighty-four contains the question, didn't you already know that this would start to happen. sentence eighty-five agrees. when i start to read sentence eighty-six i discover it contains the words, it is also true that what you said could be. for this reason, sentence eighty-seven is a sentence about why there are certainly points of correspondence between what we expect to be the case and what is. sentence eighty-eight proclaims it feels the excitement and not the work. sentence eighty-nine takes action without saying anything first. in sentence ninety i cover my eyes. in sentence ninety-one i uncover my eyes so that i can look again. in sentence ninety-two i cover them again. now i am speaking to you. now i am speaking to you. say the words after me just as i say them. what it means to live is the subject of sentence ninety-six. you are moving out of earshot now. we are not going to miss each other. you have an excellent memory. please never forget i

i am sick of singing; the bays burn deep and chafe: i am fain to rest a little from praise and grievous pleasure and pain. for the gods we know not of, who give us our daily breath, we know they are cruel as love or life, and lovely as death. o gods dethroned and deceased, cast forth, wiped out in a day! from your wrath is the world released, redeemed from your chains, men say. new gods are crowned in the city; their flowers have broken your rods; they are merciful, clothed with pity, the young compassionate gods. but for me their new device is barren, the days are bare; things long past over suffice, and men forgotten that were. time and the gods are at strife; ye dwell in the midst thereof, draining a little life from the barren breasts of love. i say to you, cease, take rest; yea, i say to you all, be at peace, till the bitter milk of her breast and the barren bosom shall cease. wilt thou yet take all, galilean? but these thou shalt not take, the laurel, the palms and the pæan, the breasts of the nymphs in the brake; breasts more soft than a dove's, that tremble with tenderer breath; and all the wings of the loves, and all the joy before death; all the feet of the hours that sound as a single lyre, dropped and deep in the flowers, with strings that flicker like fire. more than these wilt thou give, things fairer than all these things? nay, for a little we live, and life hath mutable wings. a little while and we die; shall life not thrive as it may? for no man under the sky lives twice, outliving his day. and grief is a grievous thing, and a man hath enough of his tears: why should he labour, and bring fresh grief to blacken his years? thou hast conquered, o pale galilean; the world has grown grey from thy breath; we have drunken of things lethean, and fed on the fullness of death. laurel is green for a season, and love is sweet for a day; but love grows bitter with treason, and laurel outlives not may. sleep, shall we sleep after all? for the world is not sweet in the end; for the old faiths loosen and fall, the new years ruin and rend. fate is a sea without shore, and the soul is a rock that abides; but her ears are vexed with the roar and her face with the foam of the tides. o lips that the live blood faints in, the leavings of racks and rods! o ghastly glories of saints, dead limbs of gibbeted gods! though all men abase them before you in spirit, and all knees bend, i kneel not neither adore you, but standing, look to the end. all delicate days and pleasant, all spirits and sorrows are cast far out with the foam of the present that sweeps to the surf of the past: where beyond the extreme sea-wall, and between the remote sea-gates, waste water washes, and tall ships founder, and deep death waits: where, mighty with deepening sides, clad about with the seas as with wings, and impelled of invisible tides, and fulfilled of unspeakable things, white-eyed and poisonous-finned, shark-toothed and serpentine-curled, rolls, under the whitening wind of the future, the wave of the world. the depths stand naked in sunder behind it, the storms flee away; in the hollow before it the thunder is taken and snared as a prey; in its sides is the north-wind bound; and its salt is of all men's tears; with light of ruin, and sound of changes, and pulse of years: with travail of day after day, and with trouble of hour upon hour; and bitter as blood is the spray; and the crests are as fangs that devour: and its vapour and storm of its steam as the sighing of spirits to be; and its noise as the noise in a dream; and its depth as the roots of the sea: and the height of its heads as the height of the utmost stars of the air: and the ends of the earth at the might thereof tremble, and time is made bare. will ye bridle the deep sea with reins, will ye chasten the high sea with rods? will ye take her to chain her with chains, who is older than all ye gods? all ye as a wind shall go by, as a fire shall ye pass and be past; ye are gods, and behold, ye shall die, and the waves be upon you at last. in the darkness of time, in the deeps of the years, in the changes of things, ye shall sleep as a slain man sleeps, and the world shall forget you for kings. though the feet of thine high priests tread where thy lords and our forefathers trod, though these that were gods are dead, and thou being dead art a god, though before thee the throned cytherean be fallen, and hidden her head, yet thy kingdom shall pass, galilean, thy dead shall go down to thee dead. of the maiden thy mother men sing as a goddess with grace clad around; thou art throned where another was king; where another was queen she is crowned. yea, once we had sight of another: but now she is queen, say these. not as thine, not as thine was our mother, a blossom of flowering seas, clothed round with the world's desire as with raiment, and fair as the foam, and fleeter than kindled fire, and a goddess, and mother of rome. for thine came pale and a maiden, and sister to sorrow; but ours, her deep hair heavily laden with odour and colour of flowers, white rose of the rose-white water, a silver splendour, a flame, bent down unto us that besought her, and earth grew sweet with her name. for thine came weeping, a slave among slaves, and rejected; but she came flushed from the full-flushed wave, and imperial, her foot on the sea. and the wonderful waters knew her, the winds and the viewless ways, and the roses grew rosier, and bluer the sea-blue stream of the bays. ye are fallen, our lords, by what token? we wise that ye should not fall. ye were all so fair that are broken; and one more fair than ye all. but i turn to her still, having seen she shall surely abide in the end; goddess and maiden and queen, be near me now and befriend. o daughter of earth, of my mother, her crown and blossom of birth, i am also, i also, thy brother; i go as i came unto earth. in the night where thine eyes are as moons are in heaven, the night where thou art, where the silence is more than all tunes, where sleep overflows from the heart, where the poppies are sweet as the rose in our world, and the red rose is white, and the wind falls faint as it blows with the fume of the flowers of the night, and the murmur of spirits that sleep in the shadow of gods from afar grows dim in thine ears and deep as the deep dim soul of a star, in the sweet low light of thy face, under heavens untrod by the sun, let my soul with their souls find place, and forget what is done and undone. thou art more than the gods who number the days of our temporal breath; let these give labour and slumber; but thou, proserpina, death. therefore now at thy feet i abide for a season in silence. i know i shall die as my fathers died, and sleep as they sleep; even so. for the glass of the years is brittle wherein we gaze for a span; a little soul for a little bears up this corpse which is man. so long i endure, no longer; and laugh not again, neither weep. for there is no god found stronger than death; and death is a sleep. <line>","religion,christianity,mythology & folklore,greek & roman mythology"

he’s worth, <line> <line>which isn’t much, finally, <line> <line>little wizened thing <line> <line>plopping out to an earth <line> <line>where cries of agony <line> <line>dwindle to equivocal joy(it’s, it’s…is it a boy?) <line> <line>and some clear world lies <line> <line>just beyond the eyes <line> <line>you can’t quite open; <line> <line> <line> <line>and everything is wet, <line> <line>and loud, and broken; <line> <line>and all of life is one huge tit <line> <line>you’re meant to somehow suck. <line> <line> <line> <line>serious staggers to his feet, <line> <line>slaps himself harder than the doctor did <line> <line>and says, i’m fucked. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>3. <line> <line>serious is learning silence <line> <line>in the way most children learn to speak.poshlust! <line> <line>he gasps after his first feeding,götterdämmerung in his first dusk, <line> <line>his whole body writhing with a kind of violence <line> <line>as if the world had wounded him, <line> <line>words his bleeding. <line> <line> anomie, deus absconditus <line> <line>drift into the air above his crib;accursed progenitor, quintessence of dust <line> <line>dribble with the pap onto his bib; <line> <line>as day by day, and week by week, <line> <line>serious wrestles with this difficult gift, <line> <line>forgetting, which, it seems, he is on this earth to do. <line> <line> boob, ass, oaf, <line> <line>riving out of him like greatness going off;ninny, crackpate, clunkhead, gorm, <line> <line>leaving him gasping and bent;fragments, sheep, rabble, <line> <line>all falling, falling from him <line> <line>backwards into babble... <line> <line> <line> <line>finally serious lies there, spent, <line> <line>language like some immense ghostly mobile <line> <line>bobbing just above his bed, <line> <line>all power of movement gone as well: <line> <line> <line> <line>useless little buglike arms, buglike little fingers, <line> <line>this heavy, heavy head. <line> <line> <line> <line>and now if there’s something serious can’t quite taste, <line> <line>or if he feels too acutely his own waste, <line> <line>or knows too acutely what he can’t tell, <line> <line>he screams and screams <line> <line>until the world knows what serious means. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>4. <line> <line>serious goes to school.just try it, his mum says <line> <line>as she lets go his hand <line> <line>and wipes a last glaze <line> <line>of doughnut from his nose, <line> <line>and serious, insofar as serious can, <line> <line>does give it a good try, <line> <line>though it’s hard to understand <line> <line>why they keep taking a break <line> <line>from taking breaks, or why <line> <line>they can’t simply walk <line> <line>in line down the hall, <line> <line>or what, finally, is at stake <line> <line>in a game of kickball. <line> <line> <line> <line>it’s time to draw a tree. <line> <line>what a relief to work alone, <line> <line>serious thinks, as he picks a scab <line> <line>for just the right tinge of sky, <line> <line>breaks his sugar cookie <line> <line>to make a place of stone, <line> <line>and fashions out of bread <line> <line>a man with a huge head <line> <line>and huge, ruined wings, <line> <line>gasping at all the ruined things <line> <line>to which he’s tumbled. <line> <line>and calls it: cookie, crumbled. <line> <line> oh my, the teacher says <line> <line>when she walks by,those are interesting trees. <line> <line>serious closes his eyes and sees <line> <line>as in a vision of doom <line> <line>himself drowning in schools, <line> <line>a whole ocean of fools <line> <line>nipping, nipping at him <line> <line>with their tiny, tiny teeth. <line> <line>and serious sighs <line> <line>with a prophet’s wisdom <line> <line>as he climbs up into his seat, <line> <line>stares out across the room <line> <line>and like a prophet cries:you’re all going to die! <line> <line> <line> <line>the class is a tomb. <line> <line>serious, rigid, waits. <line> <line>a girl in pigtails giggles, <line> <line>then another near the back. <line> <line>and as if along a fuse <line> <line>the giggling goes <line> <line>up and down the rows <line> <line>till someone makes a crack <line> <line>about his coat and tie <line> <line>and the laughter detonates. <line> <line> <line> <line>serious climbs slowly down <line> <line>into that inferno of sound <line> <line>which the teacher’s shouts <line> <line>are only driving higher, <line> <line>packs up his lunchbox, his dignity, <line> <line>and his copy of sartre, <line> <line> <line> <line>and strides with a prophet’s gaze <line> <line>through all that derisive fire. <line> <line>only once does he turn, <line> <line>briefly, to look back through the blaze <line> <line>at the iron fact of his art, <line> <line>smaller from here, but unburned. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>5. <line> <line>serious loves his mum. <line> <line>and then he doesn’t, quite. <line> <line>it’s that way with everything— <line> <line>baths and plums, <line> <line>the blessèd silence of night. <line> <line> would you like to help with this? <line> <line>his mother asks <line> <line>as she rolls out biscuit dough <line> <line>and cuts it with a glass <line> <line>or folds the clothes <line> <line>still warm from the sun. <line> <line>but serious knows <line> <line>he was born with a task, <line> <line>and though he touches the clothes <line> <line>and tastes the dough, <line> <line>serious says, no. <line> <line> <line> <line>serious stays in the bath <line> <line>until his skin is shriveled and cold, <line> <line>eats himself sick on plums, <line> <line>feels in the dark <line> <line>the dark he becomes, <line> <line>and cries out in the night for his mum. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>6. <line> <line>serious is older now. <line> <line>he just is.thank god, serious says, <line> <line>for whom childhood, that stupid carousel that never stops, <line> <line>always had an element of disingenuousness: <line> <line>the tristesse of lollipops, <line> <line>the sham of naps; <line> <line>fools dandling you on their laps <line> <line>so you can play horsey, which damn sure isn’t serious; <line> <line>and all that endless business <line> <line>of pretending to be curious <line> <line>about the most obvious things: <line> <line>what’s night? where’s mama-cat? <line> <line>what’s wrong with pop? can god die? <line> <line>why, why, why? <line> <line> <line> <line>to hell with that, <line> <line>serious thinks, as he sits incinerating memories <line> <line>one by one, <line> <line>saying their names as he feeds them <line> <line>like photographs to a fire: <line> <line>here he is in a baseball uniform <line> <line>squinting back the sun; <line> <line>here in a blue tuxedo with a ruffled front; <line> <line>and here, lord, with pimples. <line> <line>he pauses a moment. <line> <line>do memories have names? <line> <line>and what, exactly, are these flames? <line> <line>to hell with that! <line> <line>done. <line> <line> <line> <line>serious owns a car, pays taxes, <line> <line>contemplates a pension, <line> <line>has a crease of gray along his temples, <line> <line>but he is young, young. <line> <line>he develops headaches, begins sleeping badly, and relaxes, <line> <line>you might say, into the constant tension <line> <line>that he really always was, <line> <line>with far, far too much to do <line> <line>to look anywhere but onward, <line> <line>or to answer the questions of a child <line> <line>with anything true. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>7. <line> <line>serious isn’t stupid, <line> <line>though they go to the same gym. <line> <line>serious sees him dropping weights <line> <line>or picking his butt and thinks, <line> <line>at least i’m not him. <line> <line>nor is he mean or vain, <line> <line>those chiseled twins <line> <line>with matching boots and belts, <line> <line>nor smug who notes their sins, <line> <line>nor shallow noting something else; <line> <line>he isn’t useless timid <line> <line>who no matter what won’t complain, <line> <line>nor fat-assed nice sweating honey <line> <line>on all the machines, <line> <line>nor self-loathing who smudges mirrors, <line> <line>nor whacked who licks them clean. <line> <line>serious isn’t funny. <line> <line> <line> <line>serious spreads his towel on the bench, <line> <line>sits down in front of his own image, <line> <line>and serious strains at a serious weight. <line> <line>and never, not once, when he’s seen <line> <line>in myriad mirrors around the room <line> <line>that everyone else is straining too, <line> <line>has he caught himself too late <line> <line>and finished with a roar <line> <line>and more strength <line> <line>than he’s ever had before:i am not you! <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>8. <line> <line>serious has a date with doom. <line> <line>it’s not the first, and seems unlikely to be the last, <line> <line>for they get on quite well, doom and he, <line> <line>share similar pasts <line> <line>and similar ideas about what life should be. <line> <line>it seems, in fact, that this might just bloom. <line> <line> <line> <line>and what a relief. <line> <line>after morose and mad and neurotic; <line> <line>after almost falling for grief, <line> <line>who was so exotic <line> <line>she made all the others seem tame. <line> <line>then to discover she even lied about her name. <line> <line>and to sleep with another serious! that was odd, <line> <line>like wrestling with an angel, <line> <line>though it was hard to tell from that rough unsated tangle <line> <line>which one was serious, and which one god. <line> <line> <line> <line>but how easy it is to be himself with doom, <line> <line>serious thinks, as he puts the wine in to chill <line> <line>and sets two glasses on a tray, <line> <line>who always wants whatever serious wants <line> <line>and always agrees with what he has to say; <line> <line>who doesn’t need to hear that whole spiel <line> <line>about “going too fast” or “needing more room”; <line> <line>and who doesn’t probe and pry that long needle into his brain <line> <line>—what do you feel? what do you feel?— <line> <line>until it’s all serious can do not to stand up and scream: pain! <line> <line> <line> <line>lucky to be alive. <line> <line>and if he still has no clear idea where she lives, <line> <line>and never knows quite when she’ll arrive, <line> <line>still, something about doom feels right <line> <line>to serious, and he looks forward to their dates. <line> <line>he checks himself in the mirror, dims the light, <line> <line>and waits. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>9. <line> <line>serious is a traveler. <line> <line>“traveling broadens the mind,” <line> <line>the man beside him says, <line> <line>his tray table down and seat reclined <line> <line>even as they're taking off, <line> <line>and serious, who has his eyes closed <line> <line>so he can do what serious does, <line> <line>begins to cough. <line> <line> <line> <line> what do they say, what do they fear, <line> <line> is this song joy or grief? <line> <line> this is a man, this is a god. <line> <line> who are you and why are you here? <line> <line> to leave, to leave. <line> <line> <line> <line>the meal is over, <line> <line>which serious declined. <line> <line>in the shell-roar of the cabin <line> <line>he eases somewhat, is surprised to find <line> <line>he could almost drift away. <line> <line>“what line of work are you in?” <line> <line>he hears the man beside him say, <line> <line>and serious begins coughing wildly again. <line> <line> <line> <line> what is that smell, what was that sound, <line> <line> isn’t that ice on the wings? <line> <line> this is the air, there is the water, <line> <line> but what do you do on the way down? <line> <line> you scream, you scream. <line> <line> <line> <line>how far they must have gone by now, <line> <line>that old familiar world miles behind, <line> <line>the man eats an orange, <line> <line>and now he eats the rind. <line> <line>he eats his plate, his plastic fork, chews <line> <line>with animal relish his styrofoam cup, <line> <line>leans over to eat bittersweet serious too, <line> <line>who startles and wakes up. <line> <line> <line> <line> look at the desert, look at the green, <line> <line> is there an end to that ice? <line> <line> here is a place, and here is a place, <line> <line> but what is the space between? <line> <line> it’s life, it’s life. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>10. <line> <line>serious is married. <line> <line>what a weird wind this is, <line> <line>he thinks, so still at times, <line> <line>then stinging the eyes to tears. <line> <line>and how he seems both more and less <line> <line>himself, and how it seems at once all of loneliness <line> <line>and something he can hold. <line> <line>or is it he who's being carried? <line> <line>he shivers, and reaches out for her again. <line> <line>or is it she who reaches, she who's cold? <line> <line>what is this wind? <line> <line>where are these years? <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>11. <line> <line>serious experiences loss. <line> <line>just like that. <line> <line>flat. <line> <line>serious experiences loss, <line> <line> <line> <line>as if he’d come to some sheer cliff <line> <line>there was no way around, <line> <line>no way to cross, <line> <line>and found, <line> <line>on the other side <line> <line>of a deep canyon, himself, <line> <line>experiencing loss. <line> <line> <line> <line>serious, when the man is gone, <line> <line>tells himself that he tried, <line> <line>tells himself that he cried and cried <line> <line>for all he was worth <line> <line>to the man sitting on the other side <line> <line>experiencing loss, <line> <line>who one day simply vanished, or moved on, <line> <line>or slipped off the edge of the earth <line> <line>and died. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>12. <line> <line>serious doesn’t speak french. <line> <line>this embarrasses serious, <line> <line>because insofar as he lives anywhere, <line> <line>serious lives in paris. <line> <line> <line> <line>he feels the city stare, <line> <line>feels himself sweat, and shake, as he tries to wrench <line> <line>the little that he’s gleaned <line> <line>into the lot that he desires; <line> <line>feels shopkeepers look at him as if he were a liar, <line> <line>waiters as if he were unclean; <line> <line> <line> <line>and feels, in truth, not at all serious, <line> <line>as if he had a huge balloon for a head <line> <line>and helium squeaks for a voice, <line> <line>as if gravity could be merely a choice <line> <line>he were making, and he might instead <line> <line>simply stop, let go, and drift away. <line> <line> <line> <line>finally serious, opposed to epiphanies, <line> <line>has one he can’t resist. <line> <line>he is serious, and to be serious <line> <line>is to know something utterly or not at all, <line> <line>and to know, moreover, <line> <line>that as you let your half-knowledge fall <line> <line>from you, it does not exist. <line> <line> <line> <line>just like that serious is himself again, <line> <line>saying weighty things <line> <line>about the flowers in the stalls, <line> <line>pondering a splendid mirage <line> <line>called the seine. <line> <line> <line> <line>and if he wakes saying fromage, <line> <line>or in some shop feels <line> <line>right on the verge of translating please, <line> <line>serious knows it’s a dream, <line> <line>and knows from childhood what to do. <line> <line>point and scream <line> <line>until the damn fools give you cheese. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>13. <line> <line>serious has some culture. <line> <line>he knows some things. <line> <line>and if, as he begins to speak, <line> <line>he should feel the immense wings <line> <line>of ignorance shadowing him, that dirty vulture <line> <line>that squawks in drawl and drips tobacco juice, <line> <line>serious knows what shelter to seek. <line> <line> <line> <line>pick a name and bach is better. <line> <line>modernism was powerful but diffuse. <line> <line>life’s drained out of pictures since the renaissance. <line> <line>technique! technique! technique! <line> <line>and about all that spastic flatulence <line> <line>called contemporary art, <line> <line>well, serious hardly knows where to start. <line> <line> <line> <line>serious sits through opera without a yawn, <line> <line>chews up books on which weaker teeth would shatter; <line> <line>he can tell you where one brushstroke lies, <line> <line>list the reasons courtly love is gone, <line> <line>pluck the speck of subject matter <line> <line>from henry james. <line> <line>serious knows some things. <line> <line> <line> <line>he thinks and thinks and thinks <line> <line>until his ignorance shrinks <line> <line>to the tiniest of flies <line> <line>alighting somewhere in the louvre. <line> <line>carefully, carefully, serious creeps <line> <line>with his massive swatter, <line> <line>saying, don’t move. don’t move. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>14. <line> <line>serious believes in nothing. <line> <line>it’s a nice day, what should we do? <line> <line>what are you thinking? <line> <line>what’s been bothering you? <line> <line>what’s that you’re drinking? <line> <line> <line> <line>serious spreads the paper on his lap <line> <line>to confirm what’s new under the sun, <line> <line>hears a tap, tap, tap <line> <line>against the windowpane. <line> <line> nothing ventured, nothing gained, <line> <line>floats up from childhood like a bit of ash, <line> <line>and serious, pausing, can almost see <line> <line>his old preacher, that atom bomb of idiocy <line> <line>who every sunday would explode. <line> <line>still, serious thinks, there’s a truth to set you free. <line> <line>but who could survive the blast? <line> <line> tap, tap, tap. <line> <line> <line> <line>serious skims the sports pages, <line> <line>reads about a storm that rages <line> <line>far out at sea. <line> <line>some talking dog is taking office, <line> <line>some country wiping out monuments, expunging its past. <line> <line> tap, tap, tap. <line> <line> goddammit, serious says, midway through a war, <line> <line>and thinks again of that old bore <line> <line>who talked and talked and talked <line> <line>until you felt your head loll and sway <line> <line>like some huge flower on a tiny stalk <line> <line>that one good breeze would break; <line> <line> <line> <line>and how you’d see him afterwards eating chicken fried steak, <line> <line>chicken fried man, <line> <line>with a tiny transistor radio in his hand <line> <line>so he could listen to the football game; <line> <line>and how his face seethed and writhed with what seemed pain <line> <line>if he saw you coming to his booth, <line> <line>and he stared off as if some great truth <line> <line>were finally, finally coming clear in that chicken fried brain <line> <line>and like a prophet he was going to stand up and shout— <line> <line>until what plopped innocuously out <line> <line>was your own name. <line> <line> tap, tap, tap. <line> <line> <line> <line>serious puts aside the news of the day <line> <line>and walks to the only window there is. <line> <line>but there’s no wind, not even the grass stirs. <line> <line>and anyway, there’s no tree. <line> <line>serious shrugs and turns away. <line> <line>must just be me. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>13. <line> <line>serious sees a child <line> <line>in the playground across the street, <line> <line>sees his huge stupid head and huge stupid feet <line> <line>as he tries to keep up with the games, <line> <line>and hears his sonar screams <line> <line>of delight amid the other children's screams, <line> <line>and hears his timid weeping when they call him names. <line> <line> <line> <line>serious sees the child standing apart sometimes <line> <line>driveling to himself in silly rhymes, <line> <line>and sees him pretend to look intently at the sky <line> <line>if serious walks by, <line> <line>or sees him simply stop and stare. <line> <line> <line> <line>gradually serious starts seeing the child everywhere, <line> <line>in a store standing in an aisle, <line> <line>in the subway while <line> <line>serious is trying to work on the way home, <line> <line>or laughing with his family in a restaurant <line> <line>where serious eats alone. <line> <line> <line> <line>serious knows the truth. <line> <line>this child wants something, his whole nature is want. <line> <line>and it begins to be annoying, <line> <line>this novice cringing, all the imbecilic and cloying <line> <line>tactics of being cute, <line> <line>the whole hangdog way he has of panhandling pity <line> <line>with his freckles and his missing tooth, <line> <line>sitting all fidgety in his sunday suit <line> <line>or babbling happily as he’s leaking snot; <line> <line> <line> <line>and then the air he suddenly puts on of being serious <line> <line>when it’s so obvious he’s not. <line> <line> <line> <line>serious sees the child in the playground <line> <line>standing to the side, <line> <line>sees his face whiten and his eyes go wide <line> <line>as serious crosses the street and strides <line> <line>until his shadow swallows the child <line> <line>and leans down close enough for them to kiss.i don’t have time for this, <line> <line>serious says,i’ve got too much to do. <line> <line> <line> <line>and the child says, who are you? <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>16. <line> <line>serious kills himself.no, no, <line> <line>shivering out of a dream, <line> <line>starlight and the hard glitter <line> <line>under the bridge’s beam, <line> <line>serious, serious, <line> <line>don’t go. <line> <line> <line> <line>serious crawls out of bed, <line> <line>feels the cold in the floor <line> <line>and thinks, suddenly, of lovely mad <line> <line>(where can she be?) <line> <line>who’d bolt out of sleep and screamfarmers get up at four! <line> <line>it’s three. <line> <line> <line> <line>serious makes himself a cup of coffee, <line> <line>which he doesn’t drink; <line> <line>tries and fails to read, <line> <line>tries and fails to think. <line> <line>serious sits, and holds himself still, <line> <line>minute by minute; <line> <line>until the dawn finally comes <line> <line>and he is in it. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>17. <line> <line>serious lives alone. <line> <line>it’s better this way, he tells himself, <line> <line>as he takes a pan from the pan shelf, <line> <line>a spatula from the spatula drawer, <line> <line>and fries two eggs the way he likes them: <line> <line>yolks of stone. <line> <line> <line> <line>no more gnats of chatter over breakfast. <line> <line>no more breakfast. it’s noon. <line> <line>no one prancing by with only panties on <line> <line>when he’s almost, almost broken through, <line> <line>or singsonging outside his doorserious, o serious, where are you? <line> <line>no more! <line> <line> <line> <line>but what, finally, does serious do? <line> <line>he sits, ignores the ringing phone, <line> <line>looks at a wall <line> <line>on one of the last warm days of the year, <line> <line>and settles back into the lifelong call <line> <line>of being serious, <line> <line>which is to see, within that whiteness, <line> <line>leaves being gently blown, <line> <line>and to feel their colors as they fall. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>18. <line> <line>serious gives a speech. <line> <line>he sets his papers on the podium, <line> <line>his glass within easy reach,tap, tap, taps the microphone. <line> <line>how vast this venue is. <line> <line>how absolute this darkness. <line> <line> to be serious is to be alone! <line> <line>serious cries out with a triumphant look on his face, <line> <line>waiting for the echoes to end <line> <line>out there in all that space, <line> <line>which the words at once define and extend. <line> <line>it takes a while, but they do die. <line> <line>the spotlight lasers in. <line> <line>he blinks hard, starts again. <line> <line> to know in every hand another’s touch, to hear a silence words only intensify, to feel not too little but too much this attenuated world— <line> <line> <line> <line>serious begins to sweat, <line> <line>feels the back of his shirt grow wet; <line> <line>looks down to see his papers swirled <line> <line>and scattered, the glass on the floor, broken. <line> <line>what’s with this fucking light, he thinks, <line> <line>or was it spoken? <line> <line>he glares out at the dark, impassive crowd <line> <line>and as if by force he could make them wake <line> <line>hears his voice growing loud: <line> <line> whatever you most treasure you will break, whatever you hold closest you will let go, there is no place that you will not leave! but to be serious— <line> <line> serious says, <line> <line>quietly now, because he has them, they are his— <line> <line> to be serious, to be truly serious, is to know that what you call your losses you cannot grieve, for it was never quite these things that you wanted—this treasure, this touch, this one place—but by such life to be haunted. <line> <line> <line> <line>brilliant! <line> <line>no notes, no flaws. <line> <line>serious stands back and waits for applause. <line> <line>the hall is silent,

introduced; <line> <line>and even given his credentials, <line> <line>this suddenly seems a most unlikely topic. <line> <line> <line> <line>serious tries to get out of the light, <line> <line>but the light goes where serious goes. <line> <line>he blunders to the edge of the stage, <line> <line>a cliff <line> <line>breaking off into a dark <line> <line>in which there's no movement, no voices, not one sigh. <line> <line> <line> <line>serious feels the rage <line> <line>draining out of him, and feels a chill, and whispers,where am i? <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>19. <line> <line>serious nears an end. <line> <line>it’s cold and getting colder, <line> <line>and serious, older, <line> <line>sits outside thinking of his good friend, <line> <line>who like so much of serious is gone, <line> <line>and thinking of that godforsaken dawn <line> <line>after the one night of his life he spent outdoors. <line> <line> tell me, <line> <line>his good friend said <line> <line>when serious staggered out to the fire,which form would you say is higher,tragedy or comedy? <line> <line> <line> <line>and serious, who had stumbled full-bladdered <line> <line>in the night from a dream of bears, <line> <line>then dreamed himself the object <line> <line>of a dozen hungry stares, <line> <line>who had swiveled, pissed into the tent, <line> <line>and sworn such things it would take a life to repent, <line> <line>serious, exhausted serious, <line> <line>was silent. <line> <line> because it’s been troubling me,serious, that the answer can only be tragedy.to be conscious is to be conscious oflosing whatever it is that you most love,and thus an art that's truly greatwill always have one deepest truth to tell,which is, my friend, this life is hell. <line> <line> <line> <line>serious looks at the sky. it’s late. <line> <line>a small wind blows <line> <line>the trees, and serious, shivering, knows <line> <line>he should head inside, <line> <line>that he is not well. <line> <line>but sitting here, letting his eyes close, <line> <line>serious can almost see that lake <line> <line>aflame with the early sun, and smell <line> <line>the sweet burn of that wood, <line> <line>and feel the way it seemed his heart would surely break <line> <line>were it not for the strange lightness in his head <line> <line>as his friend smiled and said,but maybe earth is the heaven of the good. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>20. <line> <line>serious talks to god. <line> <line>there’s no one else left. <line> <line>his mind is mash, <line> <line>his world is ash, <line> <line>and serious occasionally forgets himself, <line> <line>though he is not, not bereft, <line> <line>that sniveling idiot two doors down <line> <line>who sits up late <line> <line>with only ashes in the grate <line> <line>and talks to god. <line> <line> see? serious says. see?nothing. <line> <line>serious spreads his arms magnanimously <line> <line>as if to give god the floor. <line> <line>god declines.thou know’st the first time that we smell the airwe wawl and cry, <line> <line>serious says, louder than before.and then we wawl and cry some more,and then we die,and then we rot! <line> <line>again he waits in case <line> <line>there’s disagreement. there’s not. <line> <line> <line> <line>serious scoffs, goes to brush his teeth, <line> <line>forgets briefly to avert his eye <line> <line>from the mirror’s glare <line> <line>and finds his father there, <line> <line> <line> <line>that gentle baffled man <line> <line>who, when there was no hope, <line> <line>when he couldn’t even stand, <line> <line>carved from a piece of soap <line> <line>a silly yellow duck <line> <line>and set it in a little yellow dish. <line> <line>serious feels a tingling in his hair <line> <line>and mutters something close to a prayer,i wish, i wish... <line> <line> <line> <line>the lights go out.goddammit, serious shouts <line> <line>as he trips and falls <line> <line>to his knees on the floor, <line> <line>banging his head on the door <line> <line>as he tries to rise.goddammit! serious cries. <line> <line> <line> <line>the lights come on. <line> <line>his father’s gone, <line> <line>but there, at the edge of the sink, <line> <line>balances the little duck in the little dish <line> <line>no serious person would ever keep. <line> <line>serious tries to think, <line> <line>steadies himself as if at some brink, <line> <line>decides he needs sleep, <line> <line>that’s what he needs, <line> <line>crawling fully clothed into his bed <line> <line>and pulling the covers to his chin <line> <line>because, it seems, there’s some strange wind <line> <line> <line> <line>that’s somehow gotten inside. <line> <line>so unlike serious, <line> <line>to leave a door unclosed. <line> <line> <line> <line>yet here it is, gathering strength <line> <line>as it blows his books <line> <line>on the floor and it blows <line> <line>right through his body and it blows <line> <line>behind and below and above <line> <line>and out of the whirlwind a voice cries <line> <line> <line> <line> love <line> <line> what? serious says, as he tries <line> <line>to sit upright and looks <line> <line>wildly around him, <line> <line>raising his fist in the air.the things...i have lost— <line> <line> <line> <line>immediately he is tossed <line> <line>back against the wall <line> <line>by the force of a storm <line> <line>that has no source, no form, <line> <line>and hears again the call <line> <line>out of nowhere: <line> <line> <line> <line> love <line> <line> my god! serious screams, <line> <line>unable to help himself,what maundering politician,what decerebrated pop star, what stupid puling poet couldn’t tell me that? <line> <line>struggling to get out of bed <line> <line>he starts to cough, then choke, <line> <line>a riot in his heart, <line> <line>a riot in his head <line> <line>as he falls off the edge to the floor.who do you think you are, <line> <line>he gasps. is this... is this some sort of joke? <line> <line> <line> <line>suddenly the strange wind is quiet, <line> <line>but no less strange the calm that comes after. <line> <line> i’m serious, the voice says. <line>

knows his name, or anything he did. <line> <line>still, a few stories survive <line> <line>after all this while <line> <line>of a weird-looking man <line> <line>with a weird-looking smile <line> <line>that had, it’s said, <line> <line>almost a kind of life to it, <line> <line>though the man was seriously dead. <line> <line> <line> <line>and some remember how all the flies <line> <line>vanished for miles; <line> <line>and some say no, no, but the buzzards had weird smiles <line> <line>as if they knew something. <line> <line>and some tell of an old woman <line> <line>who would come and whisper in the dead man’s ear, <line> <line>and smooth the dead man’s hair, <line> <line>and if the door opened, disappear. <line> <line>there are even stories of that grim mortician <line> <line>who thought the smile undignified <line> <line>and tugged and tugged so hard <line> <line>he slipped and fell inside <line> <line>right on top of the dead man, <line> <line>whose lips, he swore, seemed to soften, <line> <line>seemed to somehow kiss. <line> <line>and some remember this: <line> <line>before the lid was sealed on that coffin <line> <line>and the nails driven, <line> <line>there were on that face real tears. <line> <line>and some say he smiled like a man forgiven. <line> <line> <line> <line>the dead man never hears. <line> <line>the dead man spins and spins <line> <line>with his dumb dolphin grin <line> <line>through all the places where he is <line> <line>when people talk of him again: <line> <line>in classrooms or in planes, <line> <line>in boredom or in pain; <line> <line>in front of screens <line> <line>or in the spotlight’s glare; <line> <line>in days too mild to bear <line> <line>and in the long nights where <line> <line>the dark grows steep, <line> <line>the

what greetings come there from the voiceless dead? what salutation, welcome, or reply? what pressure from the hands that lifeless lie? they are no longer here; they all are gone into the land of shadows,—all save one. honor and reverence, and the good repute that follows faithful service as its fruit, be unto him, whom living we salute. the great italian poet, when he made his dreadful journey to the realms of shade, met there the old instructor of his youth, and cried in tones of pity and of ruth: ""oh, never from the memory of my heart your dear, paternal image shall depart, who while on earth, ere yet by death surprised, taught me how mortals are immortalized; how grateful am i for that patient care all my life long my language shall declare."" to-day we make the poet's words our own, and utter them in plaintive undertone; nor to the living only be they said, but to the other living called the dead, whose dear, paternal images appear not wrapped in gloom, but robed in sunshine here; whose simple lives, complete and without flaw, were part and parcel of great nature's law; who said not to their lord, as if afraid, ""here is thy talent in a napkin laid,"" but labored in their sphere, as men who live in the delight that work alone can give. peace be to them; eternal peace and rest, and the fulfilment of the great behest: ""ye have been faithful over a few things, over ten cities shall ye reign as kings."" and ye who fill the places we once filled, and follow in the furrows that we tilled, young men, whose generous hearts are beating high, we who are old, and are about to die, salute you; hail you; take your hands in ours, and crown you with our welcome as with flowers! how beautiful is youth! how bright it gleams with its illusions, aspirations, dreams! book of beginnings, story without end, each maid a heroine, and each man a friend! aladdin's lamp, and fortunatus' purse, that holds the treasures of the universe! all possibilities are in its hands, no danger daunts it, and no foe withstands; in its sublime audacity of faith, ""be thou removed!"" it to the mountain saith, and with ambitious feet, secure and proud, ascends the ladder leaning on the cloud! as ancient priam at the scæan gate sat on the walls of troy in regal state with the old men, too old and weak to fight, chirping like grasshoppers in their delight to see the embattled hosts, with spear and shield, of trojans and achaians in the field; so from the snowy summits of our years we see you in the plain, as each appears, and question of you; asking, ""who is he that towers above the others? which may be atreides, menelaus, odysseus, ajax the great, or bold idomeneus?"" let him not boast who puts his armor on as he who puts it off, the battle done. study yourselves; and most of all note well wherein kind nature meant you to excel. not every blossom ripens into fruit; minerva, the inventress of the flute, flung it aside, when she her face surveyed distorted in a fountain as she played; the unlucky marsyas found it, and his fate was one to make the bravest hesitate. write on your doors the saying wise and old, ""be bold! be bold!"" and everywhere, ""be bold; be not too bold!"" yet better the excess than the defect; better the more than less; better like hector in the field to die, than like a perfumed paris turn and fly. and now, my classmates; ye remaining few that number not the half of those we knew, ye, against whose familiar names not yet the fatal asterisk of death is set, ye i salute! the horologe of time strikes the half-century with a solemn chime, and summons us together once again, the joy of meeting not unmixed with pain. where are the others? voices from the deep caverns of darkness answer me: ""they sleep!"" i name no names; instinctively i feel each at some well-remembered grave will kneel, and from the inscription wipe the weeds and moss, for every heart best knoweth its own loss. i see their scattered gravestones gleaming white through the pale dusk of the impending night; o'er all alike the impartial sunset throws its golden lilies mingled with the rose; we give to each a tender thought, and pass out of the graveyards with their tangled grass, unto these scenes frequented by our feet when we were young, and life was fresh and sweet. what shall i say to you? what can i say better than silence is? when i survey this throng of faces turned to meet my own, friendly and fair, and yet to me unknown, transformed the very landscape seems to be; it is the same, yet not the same to me. so many memories crowd upon my brain, so many ghosts are in the wooded plain, i fain would steal away, with noiseless tread, as from a house where some one lieth dead. i cannot go;—i pause;—i hesitate; my feet reluctant linger at the gate; as one who struggles in a troubled dream to speak and cannot, to myself i seem. vanish the dream! vanish the idle fears! vanish the rolling mists of fifty years! whatever time or space may intervene, i will not be a stranger in this scene. here every doubt, all indecision, ends; hail, my companions, comrades, classmates, friends! ah me! the fifty years since last we met seem to me fifty folios bound and set by time, the great transcriber, on his shelves, wherein are written the histories of ourselves. what tragedies, what comedies, are there; what joy and grief, what rapture and despair! what chronicles of triumph and defeat, of struggle, and temptation, and retreat! what records of regrets, and doubts, and fears! what pages blotted, blistered by our tears! what lovely landscapes on the margin shine, what sweet, angelic faces, what divine and holy images of love and trust, undimmed by age, unsoiled by damp or dust! whose hand shall dare to open and explore these volumes, closed and clasped forevermore? not mine. with reverential feet i pass; i hear a voice that cries, ""alas! alas! whatever hath been written shall remain, nor be erased nor written o'er again; the unwritten only still belongs to thee: take heed, and ponder well what that shall be."" as children frightened by a thunder-cloud are reassured if some one reads aloud a tale of wonder, with enchantment fraught, or wild adventure, that diverts their thought, let me endeavor with a tale to chase the gathering shadows of the time and place, and banish what we all too deeply feel wholly to say, or wholly to conceal. in mediæval rome, i know not where, there stood an image with its arm in air, and on its lifted finger, shining clear, a golden ring with the device, ""strike here!"" greatly the people wondered, though none guessed the meaning that these words but half expressed, until a learned clerk, who at noonday with downcast eyes was passing on his way, paused, and observed the spot, and marked it well, whereon the shadow of the finger fell; and, coming back at midnight, delved, and found a secret stairway leading underground. down this he passed into a spacious hall, lit by a flaming jewel on the wall; and opposite, in threatening attitude, with bow and shaft a brazen statue stood. upon its forehead, like a coronet, were these mysterious words of menace set: ""that which i am, i am; my fatal aim none can escape, not even yon luminous flame!"" midway the hall was a fair table placed, with cloth of gold, and golden cups enchased with rubies, and the plates and knives were gold, and gold the bread and viands manifold. around it, silent, motionless, and sad, were seated gallant knights in armor clad, and ladies beautiful with plume and zone, but they were stone, their hearts within were stone; and the vast hall was filled in every part with silent crowds, stony in face and heart. long at the scene, bewildered and amazed the trembling clerk in speechless wonder gazed; then from the table, by his greed made bold, he seized a goblet and a knife of gold, and suddenly from their seats the guests upsprang, the vaulted ceiling with loud clamors rang, the archer sped his arrow, at their call, shattering the lambent jewel on the wall, and all was dark around and overhead;— stark on the floor the luckless clerk lay dead! the writer of this legend then records its ghostly application in these words: the image is the adversary old, whose beckoning finger points to realms of gold; our lusts and passions are the downward stair that leads the soul from a diviner air; the archer, death; the flaming jewel, life; terrestrial goods, the goblet and the knife; the knights and ladies, all whose flesh and bone by avarice have been hardened into stone; the clerk, the scholar whom the love of pelf tempts from his books and from his nobler self. the scholar and the world! the endless strife, the discord in the harmonies of life! the love of learning, the sequestered nooks, and all the sweet serenity of books; the market-place, the eager love of gain, whose aim is vanity, and whose end is pain! but why, you ask me, should this tale be told to men grown old, or who are growing old? it is too late! ah, nothing is too late till the tired heart shall cease to palpitate. cato learned greek at eighty; sophocles wrote his grand oedipus, and simonides bore off the prize of verse from his compeers, when each had numbered more than fourscore years, and theophrastus, at fourscore and ten, had but begun his ""characters of men."" chaucer, at woodstock with the nightingales, at sixty wrote the canterbury tales; goethe at weimar, toiling to the last, completed faust when eighty years were past. these are indeed exceptions; but they show how far the gulf-stream of our youth may flow into the arctic regions of our lives, where little else than life itself survives. as the barometer foretells the storm while still the skies are clear, the weather warm so something in us, as old age draws near, betrays the pressure of the atmosphere. the nimble mercury, ere we are aware, descends the elastic ladder of the air; the telltale blood in artery and vein sinks from its higher levels in the brain; whatever poet, orator, or sage may say of it, old age is still old age. it is the waning, not the crescent moon; the dusk of evening, not the blaze of noon; it is not strength, but weakness; not desire, but its surcease; not the fierce heat of fire, the burning and consuming element, but that of ashes and of embers spent, in which some living sparks we still discern, enough to warm, but not enough to burn. what then? shall we sit idly down and say the night hath come; it is no longer day? the night hath not yet come; we are not quite cut off from labor by the failing light; something remains for us to do or dare; even the oldest tree some fruit may bear; not oedipus coloneus, or greek ode, or tales of pilgrims that one morning rode out of the gateway of the tabard inn, but other something, would we but begin; for age is opportunity no less than youth itself, though in another dress, and as the evening twilight fades away the sky is filled with stars, invisible by day. <line>","living,growing old,activities,school & learning,graduation"

extent that one can be said to have existed at all, they occupy different millennia, different continents. <line> <line> <line>but, to the extent that one can be said to have existed at all, both figures are considered asian—one from colchis, one from korea. <line> <line> <line>to mention the asianness of the figures creates a “racial marker” in the poem. <line> <line> <line>this means that the poem can no longer pass as a white poem, that different people can be expected to read the poem, that they can be expected to read the poem in different ways. <line> <line> <line>to mention the asianness of the figures is also to mention, by implication, the asianness of the poet. <line> <line> <line>revealing a racial marker in a poem is like revealing a gun in a story or like revealing a nipple in a dance. <line> <line> <line>after such a revelation, the poem is about race, the story is about the gun, the dance is about the body of the dancer—it is no longer considered a dance at all and is subject to regulation. <line> <line> <line>topics that have this gravitational quality of aboutness are known as “hot button” topics, such as race, violence, or sex. <line> <line> <line>“hot button” is a marketing term, coined by walter kiechel iii, in a september 1978 issue of fortune magazine. <line> <line> <line>the term evokes laboratory animals and refers to consumer desires that need to be slaked. <line> <line> <line>the term “hot button” suggests not only the slaking of such desires but also a shock or punishment for having acted on those desires, a deterrent to further actions pursuing such desires, and by extension, a deterrent to desire itself. <line> <line> <line>violence and sex are examples of desires and can be satisfied, punished, and deterred. <line> <line> <line>race is not usually considered an example of desire. <line> <line> <line>both the female and the male figures are able to articulate their desires with an unusual degree of candor and specificity. <line> <line> <line>both are responsible for many sexual deaths. <line> <line> <line>the male figure says, “when anger grips me, i cannot contain myself. only after i kill something—a person, perhaps an animal, even a chicken—can i calm down.... i am sad that your majesty does not love me and terrified when you criticize me. all this turns to anger.” “your majesty,” here, refers to the king, his father. <line> <line> <line>the female figure is never directly quoted, but pseudo-apollodorus writes that she casts a spell upon the king her husband so that when he has sex with another woman, he ejaculates wild creatures into the woman’s vagina, thereby killing her. although the punishment is enacted on the body of the woman, this punishment is meant to deter the king from slaking his desires. <line> <line> <line>both figures, royal themselves, are angry at the king, but neither attempts to kill the king—which would be political. instead they displace this anger onto other unnamed deaths, which are considered sexual but not political. <line> <line> <line>both figures have spouses known for strategy, for self-preservation in politically tumultuous times, times of many unnamed deaths. <line> <line> <line>both figures are counterfoils to their strategizing spouses, figures of excessive desire, requiring containment. <line> <line> <line>both containers are wooden. <line> <line> <line>both containers are camouflaged with a soft, yielding substance—one with grass, one with fur. <line> <line> <line>both containers are ingenious solutions to seemingly intractable problems. <line> <line> <line>one problem is political. one problem is sexual. <line> <line> <line>they are both the same problem. <line> <line> <line>they have the same solution. <line> <line> <line>the male figure waits in the container for death to come. he waits for eight days. his son will live. this ensures the succession, the frictionless transfer of power. <line> <line> <line>the female figure waits in the container for the generation of a life. we do not know how long she waits. her son will die, after waiting in his own wooden container. this ensures the succession, the frictionless transfer of power. <line> <line> <line>there are many artistic representations of both containers. <line> <line> <line>the male figure’s container is blockish, unadorned, a household object of standard size and quotidian function. tourists climb into it and pose for photos, post them online. the cramped position of their bodies generates a combination of horror and glee. this, in turn, creates discomfort, the recognition that horror and glee should not be combined, that such a combination is taboo. <line> <line> <line>the female figure’s container is customized, lushly contoured. its contours are excessively articulated to the same degree that her desire is excessively articulated. artists depict the container in cutaway view, revealing the female figure within, awaiting the wild creature. the abject position of the female figure—on all fours, pressing her genitalia back against the hollow cow’s genitalia—generates a combination of lust and revenge. this, in turn, creates discomfort—the recognition that lust and revenge should not be combined, that wild creatures and female figures should not be combined, that these combinations are taboo. <line> <line> <line>hot button topics are taboo because they generate discomfort. <line> <line> <line>the male figure slakes his violent desires and is punished. the male figure also functions as a hot button, a means whereby the violent desires of tourists are slaked, while generating discomfort in these tourists. <line> <line> <line>the female figure slakes her sexual desires and is punished. the female figure also functions as a hot button, a means whereby the sexual desires of artists are slaked, while generating discomfort in these artists. <line> <line> <line>the tourist can climb into the rice chest. the tourist can pose for a photo in the rice chest. then the tourist can climb out of the rice chest and walk away. <line> <line> <line>the artist can look into the hollow cow. the artist can render the contours of the hollow cow, the contours of the female figure. then the artist can walk away. <line> <line> <line>both containers allow the tourist and artist to touch the hot button, the taboo. <line> <line> <line>the desire and the discomfort remain contained. <line> <line> <line>both containers allow the tourist and the artist to walk away. <line> <line> <line>the male and female figures remain contained. <line> <line> <line>neither container—the rice chest, the hollow cow—appears to have any necessary connection to race. <line> <line> <line>to mention race where it is not necessary to mention race is taboo. <line> <line> <line>i have not mentioned the race of the tourist or the artist. <line> <line> <line>the tourist and the artist are allowed to pass for white. <line> <line> <line>the tourist and the artist are not contained. <line> <line> <line>i have already mentioned the race of the poet. <line> <line> <line>but to the extent that the poet is not contained, the poet is allowed to pass for white. <line> <line> <line>i have already mentioned the race of the male and female figures. <line> <line> <line>the male and female figures are contained. <line> <line> <line>the rice chest and the hollow cow are containers. <line> <line> <line>the rice chest and the hollow cow are not the only containers in this poem. <line> <line> <line>colchis and korea are containers in this poem. <line> <line> <line>asianness is a container in this poem. <line> <line> <line>race is a container in this poem. <line> <line> <line>each of these containers contains desire and its satisfaction. <line> <line> <line>each of these containers contains discomfort and deterrence. <line> <line> <line>each of these containers contains a hot button, a taboo. <line> <line> <line>the tourist and the artist can enter each of these containers. <line> <line> <line>the tourist and the artist can touch the hot button and walk away. <line> <line> <line>each of

11400,7366,"<line> <line>deep st. mary’s bell had sounded, and the twelve notes gently rounded endless chimneys that surrounded my abode in trinity. (letter g, old court, south attics), i shut up my mathematics, that confounded hydrostatics— sink it in the deepest sea! in the grate the flickering embers served to show how dull november’s fogs had stamped my torpid members, like a plucked and skinny goose. and as i prepared for bed, i asked myself with voice unsteady, if of all the stuff i read, i ever made the slightest use. late to bed and early rising, ever luxury despising, ever training, never “sizing,” i have suffered with the rest. yellow cheek and forehead ruddy, memory confused and muddy, these are the effects of study of a subject so unblest. look beyond, and see the wrangler, now become a college dangler, court some spiritual angler, nibbling at his golden bait. hear him silence restive reason, her advice is out of season, while her lord is plotting treason gainst himself, and church or state. see him next with place and pension, and the very best intention of upholding that convention under which his fortunes rose. every scruple is rejected, with his cherished schemes connected, “higher powers may be neglected— his result no further goes.” much he lauds the education which has raised to lofty station, men, whose powers of calculation calculation’s self defied. how the learned fool would wonder were he now to see his blunder, when he put his reason under the control of worldly pride. thus i muttered, very seedy, husky was my throat, and reedy; and no wonder, for indeed i now had caught a dreadful cold. thickest fog had settled slowly round the candle, burning lowly, round the fire, where melancholy traced retreating hills of gold. still those papers lay before me— problems made express to bore me, when a silent change came o’er me, in my hard uneasy chair. fire and fog, and candle faded, spectral forms the room invaded, little creatures, that paraded on the problems lying there. fathers there, of every college, led the glorious ranks of knowledge, men, whose virtues all acknowledge levied the proctorial fines; there the modest moderators, set apart as arbitrators ’twixt contending calculators, scrutinised the trembling lines. all the costly apparatus, that is meant to elevate us to the intellectual status necessary for degrees— college tutors—private coaches— line the senate-house approaches. if our alma mater dote, she’s taken care of well by these. much i doubted if the vision were the simple repetition of the statements of commission, strangely jumbled, oddly placed. when an awful form ascended, and with cruel words defended those abuses that offended my unsanctioned private taste. angular in form and feature, unlike any earthly creature, she had properties to meet your eye whatever you might view. hair of pens and skin of paper; breath, not breath but chemic vapour; dress,—such dress as college draper fashions with precision due. eyes of glass, with optic axes twisting rays of light as flax is twisted, while the parallax is made to show the real size. primary and secondary focal lines in planes contrary, sum up all that’s known to vary in those dull, unmeaning eyes. such the eyes, through which all nature seems reduced to meaner stature. if you had them you would hate your symbolising sense of sight. seeing planets in their courses thick beset with arrowy “forces,” while the common eye no more sees than their mild and quiet light. “son,” she said (what could be queerer than thus tête-a -tête to hear her talk, in tones approaching nearer to a saw’s than aught beside? for the voice the spectre spoke in might be known by many a token to proceed from metal, broken when acoustic tricks were tried. little pleased to hear the siren “own” me thus with voice of iron, i had thoughts of just retiring from a mother such a fright). “no,” she said, “the time is pressing, so before i give my blessing, i’ll excuse you from confessing what you thought of me to-night. “powers!” she cried, with hoarse devotion, “give my son the clearest notion how to compass sure promotion, and take care of number one. let his college course be pleasant, let him ever, as at present, seem to have read what he hasn’t, and to do what can’t be done. of the philosophic spirit richly may my son inherit; as for poetry, inter it with the myths of other days. cut the thing entirely, lest yon college don should put the question, why not stick to what you’re best on? mathematics always pays.” as the hag was thus proceeding to prescribe my course of reading, and as i was faintly pleading, hardly knowing what to say, suddenly, my head inclining i beheld a light form shining; and the withered beldam, whining, saw the same and slunk away. then the vision, growing brighter, seemed to make my garret lighter; as when noisome fogs of night are scattered by the rising sun. nearer still it grew and nearer, till my straining eyes caught clearer glimpses of a being dearer, dearer still than number one. in that well-remembered vision i was led to the decision still to hold in calm derision pedantry, however draped; since that artificial spectre proved a paltry sub-collector, and had nothing to connect her with the being whom she aped. i could never finish telling you of her that has her dwelling where those springs of truth are welling, whence all streams of beauty run. she has taught me that creation bears the test of calculation, but that man forgets his station if he stops when that is done. is our algebra the measure of that unexhausted treasure that affords the purest pleasure, ever found when it is sought? let us rather, realising the conclusions thence arising nature more than symbols prizing, learn to worship as we ought. worship? yes, what worship better than when free’d from every fetter that the uninforming letter rivets on the tortured mind, man, with silent admiration sees the glories of creation, and, in holy contemplation, leaves the learned crowd behind! <line>","activities,school & learning,nature,arts & sciences,philosophy,sciences"

field <line> <line>who cut the ripened barley, who gather it in sheaves, <line> <line> <line> <line>who beat grain from the sheaves with wooden flails, <line> <line>who shake it loose from the scaly husk around it, <line> <line>who throw the now threshed grain up into the gently <line> <line> <line> <line>palm-fanned air whose steady current carries off <line> <line>the chaff as the grain falls to the floor, who collect <line> <line>the grain from the floor painstakingly to grind it <line> <line> <line> <line>into flour, who bake the flour into loaves the priest will offer <line> <line>in

desire <line> <line> <line> <line>have been desired ardently for thousands of years <line> <line>and observe—they are no closer to realization today <line> <line>than in ramses’ time. nor is there cause to believe <line> <line> <line> <line>they will lose their coyness on some near tomorrow. <line> <line>attempts to speed them on have been undertaken <line> <line>from the beginning; plans to force them overnight <line> <line> <line> <line>are in copious, antagonistic operation today, and yet <line> <line>they have thoroughly eluded us, and chances are <line> <line>they will continue to elude us until the clouds part <line> <line> <line> <line>in a flash of autonomous, ardent, local brainwork— <line> <line>but when the clouds start to knit back together again, <line> <line>we’ll

without turning the light <line> <line>from their wings, their eyes; they preen themselves <line> <line> <line> <line>on the fire escape, the windowsill, their pink feet <line> <line>vulnerable—a mistake to think of them that way. <line> <line>if i turn around, the room might not be full of wings <line> <line> <line> <line>capable of acting, in many respects, as a single being, <line> <line>which is to say that i myself may be the source of <line> <line>what i sense, but am no less powerless to change it. <line> <line> <line> <line>always around me, on my body, in my mouth, i fear

fattened so far past that point <line> <line>i am engrossed, and if i picture myself outside of it <line> <line>it isn’t me anymore, but a parasite cast out, inviable. <line> <line> <line> <line>

westbound field <line> <line> <line> <line>of low air pressure developing over water over time <line> <line>and warm, saturated air on the sea surface rising <line> <line>steadily replaced by cold air from above, the cycle <line> <line> <line> <line>repeating, the warm moving upward into massive <line> <line>thunderclouds, the cold descending into the eye <line> <line>around which bands of thunderclouds spiral, counter- <line> <line> <line> <line>clockwise, often in the hundreds, the atmospheric <line> <line>pressure dropping even further, making winds <line> <line>accelerate, the

""nine years!"" cries he, who high in drury-lane lull'd by soft zephyrs through the broken pane, rhymes ere he wakes, and prints before term ends, oblig'd by hunger, and request of friends: ""the piece, you think, is incorrect: why, take it, i'm all submission, what you'd have it, make it."" three things another's modest wishes bound, my friendship, and a prologue, and ten pound. pitholeon sends to me: ""you know his grace, i want a patron; ask him for a place."" pitholeon libell'd me—""but here's a letter informs you, sir, 'twas when he knew no better. dare you refuse him? curll invites to dine, he'll write a journal, or he'll turn divine."" bless me! a packet—""'tis a stranger sues, a virgin tragedy, an orphan muse."" if i dislike it, ""furies, death and rage!"" if i approve, ""commend it to the stage."" there (thank my stars) my whole commission ends, the play'rs and i are, luckily, no friends. fir'd that the house reject him, ""'sdeath i'll print it, and shame the fools—your int'rest, sir, with lintot!"" ""lintot, dull rogue! will think your price too much."" ""not, sir, if you revise it, and retouch."" all my demurs but double his attacks; at last he whispers, ""do; and we go snacks."" glad of a quarrel, straight i clap the door, ""sir, let me see your works and you no more."" 'tis sung, when midas' ears began to spring, (midas, a sacred person and a king) his very minister who spied them first, (some say his queen) was forc'd to speak, or burst. and is not mine, my friend, a sorer case, when ev'ry coxcomb perks them in my face? ""good friend, forbear! you deal in dang'rous things. i'd never name queens, ministers, or kings; keep close to ears, and those let asses prick; 'tis nothing""—nothing? if they bite and kick? out with it, dunciad! let the secret pass, that secret to each fool, that he's an ass: the truth once told (and wherefore should we lie?) the queen of midas slept, and so may i. you think this cruel? take it for a rule, no creature smarts so little as a fool. let peals of laughter, codrus! round thee break, thou unconcern'd canst hear the mighty crack: pit, box, and gall'ry in convulsions hurl'd, thou stand'st unshook amidst a bursting world. who shames a scribbler? break one cobweb through, he spins the slight, self-pleasing thread anew; destroy his fib or sophistry, in vain, the creature's at his dirty work again; thron'd in the centre of his thin designs; proud of a vast extent of flimsy lines! whom have i hurt? has poet yet, or peer, lost the arch'd eye-brow, or parnassian sneer? and has not colley still his lord, and whore? his butchers henley, his free-masons moore? does not one table bavius still admit? still to one bishop philips seem a wit? still sappho— ""hold! for god-sake—you'll offend: no names!—be calm!—learn prudence of a friend! i too could write, and i am twice as tall; but foes like these!"" one flatt'rer's worse than all. of all mad creatures, if the learn'd are right, it is the slaver kills, and not the bite. a fool quite angry is quite innocent; alas! 'tis ten times worse when they repent. one dedicates in high heroic prose, and ridicules beyond a hundred foes; one from all grub street will my fame defend, and, more abusive, calls himself my friend. this prints my letters, that expects a bribe, and others roar aloud, ""subscribe, subscribe."" there are, who to my person pay their court: i cough like horace, and, though lean, am short, ammon's great son one shoulder had too high, such ovid's nose, and ""sir! you have an eye""— go on, obliging creatures, make me see all that disgrac'd my betters, met in me: say for my comfort, languishing in bed, ""just so immortal maro held his head:"" and when i die, be sure you let me know great homer died three thousand years ago. why did i write? what sin to me unknown dipp'd me in ink, my parents', or my own? as yet a child, nor yet a fool to fame, i lisp'd in numbers, for the numbers came. i left no calling for this idle trade, no duty broke, no father disobey'd. the muse but serv'd to ease some friend, not wife, to help me through this long disease, my life, to second, arbuthnot! thy art and care, and teach the being you preserv'd, to bear. but why then publish? granville the polite, and knowing walsh, would tell me i could write; well-natur'd garth inflamed with early praise, and congreve lov'd, and swift endur'd my lays; the courtly talbot, somers, sheffield read, ev'n mitred rochester would nod the head, and st. john's self (great dryden's friends before) with open arms receiv'd one poet more. happy my studies, when by these approv'd! happier their author, when by these belov'd! from these the world will judge of men and books, not from the burnets, oldmixons, and cookes. soft were my numbers; who could take offence, while pure description held the place of sense? like gentle fanny's was my flow'ry theme, a painted mistress, or a purling stream. yet then did gildon draw his venal quill; i wish'd the man a dinner, and sat still. yet then did dennis rave in furious fret; i never answer'd, i was not in debt. if want provok'd, or madness made them print, i wag'd no war with bedlam or the mint. did some more sober critic come abroad? if wrong, i smil'd; if right, i kiss'd the rod. pains, reading, study, are their just pretence, and all they want is spirit, taste, and sense. commas and points they set exactly right, and 'twere a sin to rob them of their mite. yet ne'er one sprig of laurel grac'd these ribalds, from slashing bentley down to pidling tibbalds. each wight who reads not, and but scans and spells, each word-catcher that lives on syllables, ev'n such small critics some regard may claim, preserv'd in milton's or in shakespeare's name. pretty! in amber to observe the forms of hairs, or straws, or dirt, or grubs, or worms; the things, we know, are neither rich nor rare, but wonder how the devil they got there? were others angry? i excus'd them too; well might they rage; i gave them but their due. a man's true merit 'tis not hard to find, but each man's secret standard in his mind, that casting weight pride adds to emptiness, this, who can gratify? for who can guess? the bard whom pilfer'd pastorals renown, who turns a persian tale for half a crown, just writes to make his barrenness appear, and strains, from hard-bound brains, eight lines a year: he, who still wanting, though he lives on theft, steals much, spends little, yet has nothing left: and he, who now to sense, now nonsense leaning, means not, but blunders round about a meaning: and he, whose fustian's so sublimely bad, it is not poetry, but prose run mad: all these, my modest satire bade translate, and own'd, that nine such poets made a tate. how did they fume, and stamp, and roar, and chafe? and swear, not addison himself was safe. peace to all such! but were there one whose fires true genius kindles, and fair fame inspires, blest with each talent and each art to please, and born to write, converse, and live with ease: should such a man, too fond to rule alone, bear, like the turk, no brother near the throne, view him with scornful, yet with jealous eyes, and hate for arts that caus'd himself to rise; damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer, and without sneering, teach the rest to sneer; willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike, just hint a fault, and hesitate dislike; alike reserv'd to blame, or to commend, a tim'rous foe, and a suspicious friend; dreading ev'n fools, by flatterers besieg'd, and so obliging, that he ne'er oblig'd; like cato, give his little senate laws, and sit attentive to his own applause; while wits and templars ev'ry sentence raise, and wonder with a foolish face of praise. who but must laugh, if such a man there be? who would not weep, if atticus were he? what though my name stood rubric on the walls, or plaister'd posts, with claps, in capitals? or smoking forth, a hundred hawkers' load, on wings of winds came flying all abroad? i sought no homage from the race that write; i kept, like asian monarchs, from their sight: poems i heeded (now berhym'd so long) no more than thou, great george! a birthday song. i ne'er with wits or witlings pass'd my days, to spread about the itch of verse and praise; nor like a puppy, daggled through the town, to fetch and carry sing-song up and down; nor at rehearsals sweat, and mouth'd, and cried, with handkerchief and orange at my side; but sick of fops, and poetry, and prate, to bufo left the whole castalian state. proud as apollo on his forked hill, sat full-blown bufo, puff'd by every quill; fed with soft dedication all day long, horace and he went hand in hand in song. his library (where busts of poets dead and a true pindar stood without a head,) receiv'd of wits an undistinguish'd race, who first his judgment ask'd, and then a place: much they extoll'd his pictures, much his seat, and flatter'd ev'ry day, and some days eat: till grown more frugal in his riper days, he paid some bards with port, and some with praise, to some a dry rehearsal was assign'd, and others (harder still) he paid in kind. dryden alone (what wonder?) came not nigh, dryden alone escap'd this judging eye: but still the great have kindness in reserve, he help'd to bury whom he help'd to starve. may some choice patron bless each grey goose quill! may ev'ry bavius have his bufo still! so, when a statesman wants a day's defence, or envy holds a whole week's war with sense, or simple pride for flatt'ry makes demands, may dunce by dunce be whistled off my hands! blest be the great! for those they take away, and those they left me—for they left me gay; left me to see neglected genius bloom, neglected die! and tell it on his tomb; of all thy blameless life the sole return my verse, and queensb'ry weeping o'er thy urn! oh let me live my own! and die so too! (""to live and die is all i have to do:"") maintain a poet's dignity and ease, and see what friends, and read what books i please. above a patron, though i condescend sometimes to call a minister my friend: i was not born for courts or great affairs; i pay my debts, believe, and say my pray'rs; can sleep without a poem in my head, nor know, if dennis be alive or dead. why am i ask'd what next shall see the light? heav'ns! was i born for nothing but to write? has life no joys for me? or (to be grave) have i no friend to serve, no soul to save? ""i found him close with swift""—""indeed? no doubt"", (cries prating balbus) ""something will come out"". 'tis all in vain, deny it as i will. ""no, such a genius never can lie still,"" and then for mine obligingly mistakes the first lampoon sir will. or bubo makes. poor guiltless i! and can i choose but smile, when ev'ry coxcomb knows me by my style? curs'd be the verse, how well soe'er it flow, that tends to make one worthy man my foe, give virtue scandal, innocence a fear, or from the soft-ey'd virgin steal a tear! but he, who hurts a harmless neighbour's peace, insults fall'n worth, or beauty in distress, who loves a lie, lame slander helps about, who writes a libel, or who copies out: that fop, whose pride affects a patron's name, yet absent, wounds an author's honest fame; who can your merit selfishly approve, and show the sense of it without the love; who has the vanity to call you friend, yet wants the honour, injur'd, to defend; who tells what'er you think, whate'er you say, and, if he lie not, must at least betray: who to the dean, and silver bell can swear, and sees at cannons what was never there; who reads, but with a lust to misapply, make satire a lampoon, and fiction, lie. a lash like mine no honest man shall dread, but all such babbling blockheads in his stead. let sporus tremble—""what? that thing of silk, sporus, that mere white curd of ass's milk? satire or sense, alas! can sporus feel? who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?"" yet let me flap this bug with gilded wings, this painted child of dirt that stinks and stings; whose buzz the witty and the fair annoys, yet wit ne'er tastes, and beauty ne'r enjoys, so well-bred spaniels civilly delight in mumbling of the game they dare not bite. eternal smiles his emptiness betray, as shallow streams run dimpling all the way. whether in florid impotence he speaks, and, as the prompter breathes, the puppet squeaks; or at the ear of eve, familiar toad, half froth, half venom, spits himself abroad, in puns, or politics, or tales, or lies, or spite, or smut, or rhymes, or blasphemies. his wit all see-saw, between that and this , now high, now low, now master up, now miss, and he himself one vile antithesis. amphibious thing! that acting either part, the trifling head, or the corrupted heart, fop at the toilet, flatt'rer at the board, now trips a lady, and now struts a lord. eve's tempter thus the rabbins have express'd, a cherub's face, a reptile all the rest; beauty that shocks you, parts that none will trust, wit that can creep, and pride that licks the dust. not fortune's worshipper, nor fashion's fool, not lucre's madman, nor ambition's tool, not proud, nor servile, be one poet's praise, that, if he pleas'd, he pleas'd by manly ways; that flatt'ry, even to kings, he held a shame, and thought a lie in verse or prose the same: that not in fancy's maze he wander'd long, but stoop'd to truth, and moraliz'd his song: that not for fame, but virtue's better end, he stood the furious foe, the timid friend, the damning critic, half-approving wit, the coxcomb hit, or fearing to be hit; laugh'd at the loss of friends he never had, the dull, the proud, the wicked, and the mad; the distant threats of vengeance on his head, the blow unfelt, the tear he never shed; the tale reviv'd, the lie so oft o'erthrown; th' imputed trash, and dulness not his own; the morals blacken'd when the writings 'scape; the libell'd person, and the pictur'd shape; abuse, on all he lov'd, or lov'd him, spread, a friend in exile, or a father, dead; the whisper, that to greatness still too near, perhaps, yet vibrates on his sovereign's ear:— welcome for thee, fair virtue! all the past: for thee, fair virtue! welcome ev'n the last! ""but why insult the poor? affront the great?"" a knave's a knave, to me, in ev'ry state: alike my scorn, if he succeed or fail, sporus at court, or japhet in a jail, a hireling scribbler, or a hireling peer, knight of the post corrupt, or of the shire; if on a pillory, or near a throne, he gain his prince's ear, or lose his own. yet soft by nature, more a dupe than wit, sappho can tell you how this man was bit: this dreaded sat'rist dennis will confess foe to his pride, but friend to his distress: so humble, he has knock'd at tibbald's door, has drunk with cibber, nay, has rhym'd for moore. full ten years slander'd, did he once reply? three thousand suns went down on welsted's lie. to please a mistress one aspers'd his life; he lash'd him not, but let her be his wife. let budgell charge low grub street on his quill, and write whate'er he pleas'd, except his will; let the two curlls of town and court, abuse his father, mother, body, soul, and muse. yet why? that father held it for a rule, it was a sin to call our neighbour fool: that harmless mother thought no wife a whore,— hear this! and spare his family, james moore! unspotted names! and memorable long, if there be force in virtue, or in song. of gentle blood (part shed in honour's cause, while yet in britain honour had applause) each parent sprung—""what fortune, pray?""—their own, and better got, than bestia's from the throne. born to no pride, inheriting no strife, nor marrying discord in a noble wife, stranger to civil and religious rage, the good man walk'd innoxious through his age. no courts he saw, no suits would ever try, nor dar'd an oath, nor hazarded a lie: un-learn'd, he knew no schoolman's subtle art, no language, but the language of the heart. by nature honest, by experience wise, healthy by temp'rance and by exercise; his life, though long, to sickness past unknown; his death was instant, and without a groan. o grant me, thus to live, and thus to die! who sprung from kings shall know less joy than i. o friend! may each domestic bliss be thine! be no unpleasing melancholy mine: me, let the tender office long engage to rock the cradle of reposing age, with lenient arts extend a mother's breath, make langour smile, and smooth the bed of death, explore the thought, explain the asking eye, and keep a while one parent from the sky! on cares like these if length of days attend, may heav'n, to bless those days, preserve my friend, preserve him social, cheerful, and serene, and just as rich as when he serv'd a queen. whether that blessing be denied or giv'n, thus far was right, the rest belongs to heav'n. <line>","relationships,friends & enemies,arts & sciences,humor & satire,poetry & poets,social commentaries"

curry—amazingly good. i’d thought <line> <line>to send joel, and peter, and michael an email <line> <line> <line> <line>letting them know of my transition, but did not. the consequences <line> <line>of this transition could be catastrophic. i feel more loving toward brenda <line> <line> <line> <line>than ever. i could die, or worse. as i meditated today <line> <line>my books to the left of me seemed packed and dense <line> <line> <line> <line>against the wall. soon, chuck will be here <line> <line>to play chess upstairs. i told the doctor this morning <line> <line> <line> <line>that the philosophy and religion of the cyborg <line> <line>have not yet been written. my <line> <line> <line> <line>poetry <line> <line>has just begun. i am <line> <line> <line> <line>a fourth form, <line> <line>though not as dodie saw it. together, <line> <line> <line> <line>we can belong in this world. artaud <line> <line>arrived at the double <line> <line> <line> <line>as i have. we share more in common <line> <line>than i’d known before last night. i need less sleep <line> <line> <line> <line>than before, and i sleep better <line> <line>and am more rested. i feel sad and cheated <line> <line> <line> <line>that i need to rely on drugs <line> <line>so completely. i wonder about paul bowles’ stories. <line> <line> <line> <line>i need to reach out <line> <line>to others <line> <line> <line> <line>through this. the doctor, this morning, said <line> <line>that i was enlightened, but not <line> <line> <line> <line>quite there—somehow—i can’t remember <line> <line>how. i doubt he knows <line> <line> <line> <line>what he means by “enlightenment.” i felt far away <line> <line>from my sister yesterday, when she called. michael <line> <line> <line> <line>talked to me of christ’s <line> <line>tenderness. i feel tender in this moment. over <line> <line> <line> <line>and over i feel that words <line> <line>do not represent me. i am not <line> <line> <line> <line>sure what that implies of my intentions <line> <line>in using them. yesterday, brenda and i saw <line> <line> <line> <line>the warhol show of the last ten years <line> <line>of his life. there seemed to have been hope <line> <line> <line> <line>to live meaningfully in capitalism then. ~~~~~~~ the waves <line> <line>of this beginning, the new life of my mind <line> <line> <line> <line>is settling. it’s been a while since i’ve written. i’ve decided <line> <line>to mark my continuing with the seven tildes above. and i added <line> <line> <line> <line>a title tonight, muerto vecino, after zizek’s dubious interpretation <line> <line>of kierkegaard’s neighbor, and because of the funeral home <line> <line> <line> <line>across the street. my thinking has changed, my being has changed, <line> <line>i am more alert and more engaged in thinking through the world. <line> <line> <line> <line>and i am able to speak better. i don’t know what this means <line> <line>about who i am. i try not to feel let down that for so much of my life <line> <line> <line> <line>i’ve been restrained by psychotropic drugs. before zyprexa it was even <line> <line>worse, with up to 6 meds, as i’ve said over and over to friends. i feel <line> <line> <line> <line>the need to make clear what my obstacles have been. not for pity, <line> <line>a little for pride, but also for hope. if i can do that, then maybe i can help <line> <line> <line> <line>someone not suffer so much, like brenda. i replaced the kitchen faucet <line> <line>this past weekend. it makes me very happy that i was able to do it <line> <line> <line> <line>successfully, without ever having been handy before in my life, and after <line> <line>spending most of my life disdainful of being practical in that way. what a joy <line> <line> <line> <line>to make brenda so happy. i don’t know how much longer i will live, <line> <line>and have often thought, recently, that it would be tragic if i died anytime <line> <line> <line> <line>soon, but that it’s imperative that i accept death when it arrives, after <line> <line>affirming life as fully as i can. it’s too easy, and stupid, to be simplistically <line> <line> <line> <line>oppositional. and to not know that people can ruin anything, but <line> <line>that the substantial things have value of themselves, is foolish. i don’t want to stop <line> <line> <line> <line>at my own ignorance and lack of forbearance. i don’t believe in the west <line> <line>on its own. as michael says, the only thing that makes sense here <line> <line> <line> <line>is love. i have everything i could possibly ever want or need for now. more books <line> <line>will come, more music too. and love is immeasurable <line> <line> <line> <line>when it’s real. i am so grateful to have more waking time <line> <line>on the weekends. i plan on making breakfast for brenda <line> <line> <line> <line>every saturday and sunday that i can <line> <line>from now on. early. i see gardens in the future of our household. <line> <line> <line> <line>and i wonder about a great spirit. what does the name matter? i see the stones that live <line> <line>without water. i see the smoke that cleanses my vision, and a network of consciousness, <line> <line> <line> <line>with each node another, on and on that way to the depths. my thinking will never <line> <line>grasp it all <line> <line> <line> <line>because of that recursively created network of interior life. my thinking stops <line> <line>then, barely able to contain the spherical and vast darkness <line> <line> <line> <line>from which all light arises. that’s why what i see is dark. it is brilliant <line> <line>in its darkness. like onyx and flint. i can only talk around what i’ve seen <line> <line> <line> <line>the past couple of weeks. it reframes, completely, the rest of my creative <line> <line>life and the rest of my days. all i aim to do now is to focus my attention, <line> <line> <line> <line>so that i can see it all again in retrospect. so that i can read <line> <line>and gather more tools for understanding it. so that i understand myself, <line> <line> <line> <line>and something of the world, and love, and so that i help others. geodon <line> <line>will not erase it. i’ve seen it already, many times. it is my natural state. <line> <line> <line> <line>i no longer see it as only hallucination. it is a way of being. a way that i can flesh <line> <line>out, here. slowly. carefully. and as i do, its destructive powers, <line> <line> <line> <line>which are massive and righteous, will subside. as it will know that it is being <line> <line>given to the world. because it belongs to all. and all will be there soon. <line> <line> <line> <line>there are signs already. because to see it is to break, unless one knows something <line> <line>of love. it makes lsd <line> <line> <line> <line>small. it is god and the universe as one. <line> <line>i am not the first to see it. but i am a person <line> <line> <line> <line>given a chance <line> <line>to write it, letter by letter, slowly, in terms of the light of my ignorance <line> <line> <line> <line>to see more fully <line> <line>what i do not know. i do not offer anything <line> <line> <line> <line>but poems. but it breaks through <line> <line>my mouth to arrive at the hearts of the world, at the hearts of the horses <line> <line> <line> <line>of the world, to allow us all to speak in silence. it is not god or the universe. <line> <line>it is one as all in you. because i cannot see through myself <line> <line> <line> <line>without it. i see clearly <line> <line>that the sun will not arrive <line> <line> <line> <line>in this new weather. but that the moon <line> <line>will take its place. i see clearly that the sun is there <line> <line> <line> <line>to bring meaning to the sky, and that the earth is more full <line> <line>with the light of the world <line> <line> <line> <line>extinguished for a brilliant view of wilderness. this is a view <line> <line>that extends through opposites <line> <line> <line> <line>and arrives at a single body <line> <line>to witness this song. and this song is not the answer <line> <line> <line> <line>that you believe in, because one day <line> <line>i will speak to you again <line> <line> <line> <line>in the rain <line> <line>and show you <line> <line> <line> <line>that i do not know. because knowledge <line> <line>belongs to the earth. and the earth makes everything <line> <line> <line> <line>i know. and now that there is less and less freedom <line> <line>from coercion in a moneyed world, and now that claire, <line> <line> <line> <line>a friend, is moving on to be christ in her own way, now <line> <line>that guénon continues to call me to understand <line> <line> <line> <line>my ignorance, to depart again <line> <line>from the friends at kuna yala, where i helped with the water, <line> <line> <line> <line>with brenda watching over me <line> <line>from a hammock between palms, now that panamá <line> <line> <line> <line>calls again to give me a union <line> <line>of the world, in more than two ways, <line> <line> <line> <line>and to distinguish from the surface of these times, i <line> <line>receive <line> <line> <line> <line>a call to awaken in the snow. i receive a call to acknowledge <line> <line>that geodon has planted itself <line> <line> <line> <line>with capital <line> <line>in my consciousness, but that the world <line> <line> <line> <line>is stronger than to balance itself <line> <line>from the ozone and people alone. we are not erased, and we <line> <line> <line> <line>do not control the earth. geodon <line> <line>is an act of kindness, an agreement <line> <line> <line> <line>to live this life <line> <line>in a way that arrives <line> <line> <line> <line>with the weather. it may continue <line> <line>for the rest of my life, or it may not. i will not be afraid again <line> <line> <line> <line>to see things as i do, and i will not <line> <line>seek out the truth, intentionally, without some kind of agreement <line> <line> <line> <line>with this custom. because that is a way, for now, <line> <line>that i speak. and it is useful, though better left <line> <line> <line> <line>invisible. and the name, geodon, brings trouble, i can see <line> <line>through it enough, with enough love in my life, to believe <line> <line> <line> <line>in the end of the reign of the anti-christ (not obama). i need to learn again <line> <line>to be and to write. but to deliver <line> <line> <line> <line>what i saw <line> <line>i must return <line> <line> <line> <line>to the explosion of my inner life. to start with, otherwise and generally, i see <line> <line>only outlines. creation manifests <line> <line> <line> <line>from every direction, in an infinity <line> <line>of dimensions. most of us <line> <line> <line> <line>spend most of our energy <line> <line>conscious of a very few of these dimensions. imagine <line> <line> <line> <line>more than the greatest works of art <line> <line>manifesting endlessly <line> <line> <line> <line>from more directions than one can possibly count <line> <line>every micro second, timelessly. it’s glorious. <line> <line> <line> <line>and the only way to see it with any balance <line> <line>is impeccably, ethically, compassionately, and with at least an aim <line> <line> <line> <line>toward the divine. it is the divine. god and the universe <line> <line>spoke to me. it is all, always, speaking to us. and what it says <line> <line> <line> <line>is endless <line> <line>it brings wholeness <line> <line> <line> <line>to the precious moment. it goes away <line> <line>when one tries to pin it down, as i do. i say less and less <line> <line> <line> <line>as i try to describe it. it is endlessly <line> <line>generative. it is good <line> <line> <line> <line>but pitiless and merciful. it demands of us <line> <line>that we arrive. and now that the thinking manifests <line> <line> <line> <line>in a way that allows <line> <line>for union and a bridge, in a way that avoids <line> <line> <line> <line>easy condemnation, a thinking that reveals <line> <line>the links toward light <line> <line> <line> <line>in motion, a primordial <line> <line>form of being <line> <line> <line> <line>in a new world that needs no one <line> <line>to believe in it, a vast chasm <line> <line> <line> <line>in what a bureaucracy of thought <line> <line>tries to pin us down with, the hole in time <line> <line> <line> <line>that allows us to be free <line> <line>is here, we know it. all of us <line> <line> <line> <line>can see through delusion. there is no road <line> <line>in the aftermath of earthquakes, no need for the time <line> <line> <line> <line>to extinguish the elements, no person <line> <line>locked to your heart <line> <line> <line> <line>in the morning, no water to drink <line> <line>without thirst, no air is necessary to breathe <line> <line> <line> <line>under the water of seeing, no <line> <line>need for the earth to do anything <line> <line> <line> <line>other than revolve, in this <line> <line>new light. space <line> <line> <line> <line>undoes our links <line> <line>to the immovable. we deliver <line> <line> <line> <line>the undone to the plains <line> <line>and see what the harvest <line> <line> <line> <line>will fill with seed. the whole <line> <line>does not exist <line> <line> <line> <line>within outlines. all we can do <line> <line>is move to it. the music <line> <line> <line> <line>is unheard of <line> <line>in this world. it exists <line> <line> <line> <line>without origin. it is otherworldly, <line> <line>primordial, and gentle. it vibrates, <line> <line> <line> <line>equally, in the lamb, in <line> <line>the lotus, in <line> <line> <line> <line>the stones—there is no place <line> <line>unknown to it. it is <line> <line> <line> <line>music, and nothing more, <line> <line>and nothing less. it is that <line> <line> <line> <line>everywhere possible. it is harmonious <line> <line>infinitely, and allows for any sound. to some <line> <line> <line> <line>it might seem like noise, but that <line> <line>is only the part. to achieve it <line> <line> <line> <line>one need only listen. i cannot always <line> <line>hear it, but i have <line> <line> <line> <line>heard it. and now <line> <line>in my new mind, i listen for it <line> <line> <line> <line>undaunted and silent. i feel it filling <line> <line>my body with love. sometimes <line> <line> <line> <line>i have horrific thoughts. but i am learning <line> <line>that these are but strong notes <line> <line> <line> <line>in the fullness <line> <line>of the music <line> <line> <line> <line>of my new mind. i can’t always hear the song, <line> <line>but i feel it now. it makes all context <line> <line> <line> <line>vast. i will receive it <line> <line>as long as it is here. i will not push <line> <line> <line> <line>one way or the other with it. it is a fullness <line> <line>and does not want to be made <line> <line> <line> <line>into a force. it is a force <line> <line>without me, and only to the degree <line> <line> <line> <line>to which this is true. no longer being able <line> <line>to receive it <line> <line> <line> <line>will imply a failure <line> <line>of my imagination, of my ethics, <line> <line> <line> <line>and my spirit. there is no way <line> <line>to hold on to it. it serves <line> <line> <line> <line>no one. and it includes us all. to continue to receive it <line> <line>more fully <line> <line> <line> <line>i grow. this implies <line> <line>the world. it implies clarity. it implies <line> <line> <line> <line>motion. but it rests motionlessly. if i have a softness in my voice <line> <line>it is caused by this music. when i don’t <line> <line> <line> <line>i feel less. my voice can be loud <line> <line>to receive it, but this loudness <line> <line> <line> <line>cannot be yoked <line> <line>in outlines. there is nothing i can do. <line> <line> <line> <line>there is nothing to expect. i can only <line> <line>let it go. and i can only be afraid <line> <line> <line> <line>of the horror of my thoughts <line> <line>without this music. but now that i know <line> <line> <line> <line>a taste of it, i have <line> <line>hope. good people <line> <line> <line> <line>feed it. i haven’t always known <line> <line>what to do with it and others. but now <line> <line> <line> <line>i am a little less confused <line> <line>about this. this is due <line> <line> <line> <line>to buddhism, the little that i know <line> <line>of its practice. and to love. but it does not stop <line> <line> <line> <line>at my experience. i am ignorant <line> <line>and cannot offer knowledge. except this <line> <line> <line> <line>music <line> <line>does not require knowledge. i’m not sure <line> <line> <line> <line>what it requires. it requires <line> <line>to be received, but does not need us. is there a pact <line> <line> <line> <line>between humanity <line> <line>and god? i don’t know. is there a god? <line> <line> <line> <line>i don’t know. i’m not sure the question <line> <line>is enough on its own. or maybe it is, if god <line> <line> <line> <line>is not limited by concept. and concept <line> <line>seems to be only a note in this song. problems <line> <line> <line> <line>feed it. “love <line> <line>is the absence of fear.” and “love <line> <line> <line> <line>believes all things, <line> <line>yet is never deceived.” i aim <line> <line> <line> <line>to see through my delusions. i aim <line> <line>to be one of many, a small voice <line> <line> <line> <line>in the song of the world. i rest <line> <line>in silence <line> <line> <line> <line>as i always have. “to have a view <line> <line>as vast as the sky <line> <line> <line> <line>and as fine <line> <line>as a grain of sand.” all beings <line> <line> <line> <line>want to be loved <line> <line>and to be free <line> <line> <line> <line>from suffering. we strive <line> <line>diligently <line> <line> <line> <line>to learn the vast expanse <line> <line>and the laser pointed focus <line> <line> <line> <line>of this gift. remember that light <line> <line>makes us. and that in this <line> <line> <line> <line>new world, more and more <line> <line>is made of light. and if that is the case, <line> <line> <line> <line>we move to move <line> <line>the light of the world. someday, <line> <line> <line> <line>perhaps, we will move <line> <line>the light <line> <line> <line> <line>of the computer world. only the compassionate <line> <line>and true <line> <line> <line> <line>will be able to do so. because only they <line> <line>can be selfless enough <line> <line> <line> <line>to let it move through them. i am not there <line> <line>to move it <line> <line> <line> <line>but i saw this. long ago. briefly. i was offered <line> <line>a glimpse. it is utterly simple and beyond <line> <line> <line> <line>thought. there is hope. intention <line> <line>is a thought. so one <line> <line> <line> <line>sees. i cannot tangle <line> <line>myself <line> <line> <line> <line>in the line. but only to bridge. that is part of why <line> <line>it will all move. but i cannot wait <line> <line> <line> <line>until that is possible <line> <line>to become. i can wait <line> <line> <line> <line>eternally and actively in the world <line> <line>to remain <line> <line> <line> <line>still. with the calm and expansive <line> <line>link <line> <line> <line> <line>that allows us to live, so preciously <line> <line>together, i see through <line> <line> <line> <line>the trouble that startles me, every moment <line> <line>and allow the seeing <line> <line> <line> <line>of my inner eye <line> <line>to burn through it. i do not remember <line> <line> <line> <line>what zyprexa was like any longer. except that it seems <line> <line>i have more to work with now, with my mind. and these <line> <line> <line> <line>words are plain, so as to be careful in this new place. i see <line> <line>that they do not break open my heart, as i read. and for that <line> <line> <line> <line>i relinquish this poem, and allow it to be only <line> <line>a mark on the road to further inquiry. i allow it to see <line> <line> <line> <line>as i have made a vow to bridge, that my life <line> <line>aims to be whole, even in the face of potential <line> <line> <line> <line>catastrophes, i grow more and more <line> <line>to accept death as it arrives, to allow it to soften me, <line> <line> <line> <line>and to transform me as i have been transformed through geodon, only <line> <line>to know that there is an isthmus, and that it is eternal. only that there is one <line> <line> <line> <line>heart to allow myself to speak <line> <line>in the storms of tribulation, as one speaks <line> <line> <line> <line>to allow the teamwork of the fabric of need <line> <line>of the bird malingerer to see this <line> <line> <line> <line>in the aftermath of one who has died. like a bicycle never once <line> <line>together enough to ride, i see this word here, again, to the removal <line> <line> <line> <line>of a people, to the homeland of union and pace, to the isthmus <line> <line>of a double link, one ocean to another, one continent <line> <line> <line> <line>to another, to the only union (even as it may be erased in my history), the place <line> <line>of one heart to allow the song to continue through conflict <line> <line> <line> <line>as she saw it then, one time, far away, when i hadn’t known yet, that this <line> <line>would be timeless. and there is one to it there to see it there, to allow <line> <line> <line> <line>it there to become and to see there as one is there to see <line> <line>and to allow one to arrive with it there and to see, and to be one with it <line> <line> <line> <line>there as one is there to be with it. and to see there as one is there to believe <line> <line>as it is one to believe it there <line> <line> <line> <line>and to see it there as one with the soil and the air and the light and rain <line> <line>and to be there with one to be there one with it there once again, and to see it there <line> <line> <line> <line>and to believe as there is one there to believe it there again and to see. and to see <line> <line>there as one is there to believe as it is there again <line> <line> <line> <line>and to see there as one is there to arrive and to be with it <line> <line>there and to see it there once again and to see it there again <line> <line> <line> <line>and to believe as there is one to it again and to see and to hold <line> <line>and to see it there and to hold <line> <line> <line> <line>being that nothing holds <line> <line>dissolving <line> <line>

11512,4927,"<line> <line>the philosopher david lewis spun a fantasy of two omniscient gods who know about one world, which might as well be ours. each knows precisely all there is to know, the grand “totality of facts, not things.” each knows the pattern of the light on each neglected leaf millennia ago. each knows the number of the stars, their ages, all the distances between them, all the “things too tiny to be remembered in recorded history—the backfiring of a bus/in a paris street in 1932,” as well as all the things that history distorts or just can’t see, like the thought that must have flashed across patroklos’s mind (if he’d existed and had had a mind—the middle knowledge of the schoolmen) when hektor split his stomach with a spear (if he’d existed too). each one looks on, as though through ordinary eyes, as “mme swann’s enormous coachman, supervised by a groom no bigger than his fist and as infantile as st george in the picture, endeavored to curb the ardour of the quivering steel-tipped pinions with which they thundered over the ground,” and sees “the gray ‘toppers’ of old” the gentlemen strolling with her wore, the little “woolen cap from which stuck out two blade-like partridge feathers” that she wore (or would have worn if they and she’d been real). each monitors the photons through the slits, the slow decay of radium, and knows the ratio of vermouth to gin in someone’s first martini at larre’s. each knows what darragh, geoff and willy knew before the bullet or the pavement killed their worlds, and where the shots came from in dallas. each knows precisely what the other knows, in all the senses of those words, and if a question has a factual answer, each can answer it. yet there’s a question neither can resolve: which god am i?the question posits both a world and a unique perspective on that world, which neither has. and if gods one and two could reify themselves by wondering who or what they were, they’d have to know the answer—and, because they don’t, they can’t. could gods like those be real, in something like the sense that you and i are real? but then, what sense is that? gods one and two are you and i writ large: i wander out into the day and feel the sunlight on my face. i see the sunlight on the first spring leaves like green foam on the trees, and so do you. the world we have in common, that the gods can comprehend in its entirety, remains beyond my grasp, and yours. the world i know belongs entirely to me, as yours belongs entirely to you. i know my world completely, as the gods know ours, because it’s nothing but my take on things, and starts and ends with me. i’m both the author and the captive of my world, because my take on things is all there is to me. when mary, in frank jackson’s philosophical diversion, wanders from her room of black and white and shades of gray and finally sees a rose, and then goes on in sunlight, into the hofgarten, and drinks coffee, and talks for hours, it’s hard to see how all of this (as she might say) could be an artifact of her perspective. but it is.so what? philosophers tell stories, but they make them up, and what are they to me? sometimes i think i’m humoring myself (a good thing i suppose) with an extended exercise in nonsense. have breakfast, have a cup of strong black common sense, get over it, i tell myself, refuting berkeley with my foot. instead of this entanglement of self with self, why can’t i just relax into my place inside the natural order, be a thing within the solid scheme of things, a dane in denmark? how can fantasies, unreal by definition, show me what i am, and know? how can the poetry of possibilities dissolve the prose of facts? my little life sustains me while it can, and that’s enough. it may be all contingent, but it’s real, and when catastrophes occur, as they inevitably do, i’d rather they occur to me, instead of writing them away, or redefining happiness or sorrow or tranquility as alterations of some abstract point of view that points at nothing. inescapable illusions must be real, or might as well be real, no matter where reflection on them leads; and if accepting them means taking things on faith, that’s fine. who wants to be a posit, or a site of possibilities? who wants to walk out and evaporate into this green spring day? who wants to have sex with a wraith?no matter where reflection on them leads. it leads, of course, to me. a cri de coeur is not an argument, but where the real argument begins. hopkins: “searching nature i taste self at one tankard, that of my own being.” kant: “the feeling of an existence without the least concept,” meaning that despite the certainty i have, i’ve no idea what i really am, or where, and as for “searching nature,” i have no idea even where to start. these matters mean the world to me, and yet no matter how i try to come to grips with them, they slip away. i and here and now are ever present, yet they vanish in the act of apprehension, as a poem turns into language as you write it down. dimensionless, atemporal, imprisoned in the present—even as i say them to myself the words fall short of what i thought i started out to say, like the conclusion of an argument too close to me to share, or like an empty thought balloon that hangs above me in the air. it’s not the question of what makes me who i am through time—of how a figure in a photograph from 1985, a couple sitting in the garden of the small hôtel des marronniers just off the rue jacob, could be the person who remembers her and thinks of him today—but of what constitutes me now, and of what made me then. if giving it a name won’t help, then neither will pretending it’s divine. if i should be supplanted by a bright recording angel knowing everything about me in the way the gods know all about their world, i wouldn’t have survived. she takes the whole thing in—the house on maxim street, the bike rides down the hill on wabash street, my high school friends, their friends, the friends of friends of friends—with eyes that monitor my back, my face, the traces in my brain projected on a screen, the n degrees of separation linking me to nearly everyone who’s ever lived, a thing within a wilderness of things, with each one locked inside a universe with no outside, of which there’s nothing she can see. how could it be an afterlife? it’s just a different life, another life, complete or incomplete as anyone’s, consumed by questions that elude it, not because she can’t remember, but because the words that make them up are undefined: which one of them was i? which world was mine? <line>","living,the mind,arts & sciences,philosophy,mythology & folklore,greek & roman mythology"

11635,13669,"<line> <line>some days i catch a rhythm, almost a song in my own breath. i'm alone here in brooklyn heights, late morning, the sky above the st. george hotel clear, clear for new york, that is. the radio playing ""bird flight,"" parker in his california tragic voice fifty years ago, his faltering ""lover man"" just before he crashed into chaos. i would guess that outside the recording studio in burbank the sun was high above the jacarandas, it was late march, the worst of yesterday's rain had come and gone, the sky washed blue. bird could have seen for miles if he'd looked, but what he saw was so foreign he clenched his eyes, shook his head, and barked like a dog—just once— and then howard mcghee took his arm and assured him he'd be ok. i know this because howard told me years later that he thought bird could lie down in the hotel room they shared, sleep for an hour or more, and waken as himself. the perfect sunlight angles into my little room above willow street. i listen to my breath come and go and try to catch its curious taste, part milk, part iron, part blood, as it passes from me into the world. this is not me, this is automatic, this entering and exiting, my body's essential occupation without which i am a thing. the whole process has a name, a word i don't know, an elegant word not in english or yiddish or spanish, a word that means nothing to me. howard truly believed what he said that day when he steered parker into a cab and drove the silent miles beside him while the bright world unfurled around them: filling stations, stands of fruits and vegetables, a kiosk selling trinkets from mexico and the philippines. it was all so actual and western, it was a new creation coming into being, like the music of charlie parker someone later called ""glad,"" though that day i would have said silent, ""the silent music of charlie parker."" howard said nothing. he paid the driver and helped bird up two flights to their room, got his boots off, and went out to let him sleep as the afternoon entered the history of darkness. i'm not judging howard, he did better than i could have now or then. then i was 19, working on the loading docks at railway express, coming day by day into the damaged body of a man while i sang into the filthy air the yiddish drinking songs my zadie taught me before his breath failed. now howard is gone, eleven long years gone, the sweet voice silenced. ""the subtle bridge between eldridge and navarro,"" they later wrote, all that rising passion a footnote to others. i remember in '85 walking the halls of cass tech, the high school where he taught after his performing days, when suddenly he took my left hand in his two hands to tell me it all worked out for the best. maybe he'd gotten religion, maybe he knew how little time was left, maybe that day he was just worn down by my questions about parker. to him bird was truly charlie parker, a man, a silent note going out forever on the breath of genius which now i hear soaring above my own breath as this bright morning fades into afternoon. music, i'll call it music. it's what we need as the sun staggers behind the low gray clouds blowing relentlessly in from that nameless ocean, the calm and endless one i've still to cross. <line>","living,growing old,relationships,friends & enemies,arts & sciences,music"

light issues forth, and at the other dore obsequious darkness enters, till her houre to veile the heav'n, though darkness there might well seem twilight here; and now went forth the morn such as in highest heav'n, arrayd in gold empyreal, from before her vanisht night, shot through with orient beams: when all the plain coverd with thick embatteld squadrons bright, chariots and flaming armes, and fierie steeds reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view: warr he perceav'd, warr in procinct, and found already known what he for news had thought to have reported: gladly then he mixt among those friendly powers who him receav'd with joy and acclamations loud, that one that of so many myriads fall'n, yet one returnd not lost: on to the sacred hill they led him high applauded, and present before the seat supream; from whence a voice from midst a golden cloud thus milde was heard. servant of god, well done, well hast thou fought the better fight, who single hast maintaind against revolted multitudes the cause of truth, in word mightier then they in armes; and for the testimonie of truth hast born universal reproach, far worse to beare then violence: for this was all thy care to stand approv'd in sight of god, though worlds judg'd thee perverse: the easier conquest now remains thee, aided by this host of friends, back on thy foes more glorious to return then scornd thou didst depart, and to subdue by force, who reason for thir law refuse, right reason for thir law, and for thir king messiah, who by right of merit reigns. go michael of celestial armies prince, and thou in military prowess next gabriel, lead forth to battel these my sons invincible, lead forth my armed saints by thousands and by millions rang'd for fight; equal in number to that godless crew rebellious, them with fire and hostile arms fearless assault, and to the brow of heav'n pursuing drive them out from god and bliss, into thir place of punishment, the gulf of tartarus, which ready opens wide his fiery chaos to receave thir fall. so spake the sovran voice, and clouds began to darken all the hill, and smoak to rowl in duskie wreathes, reluctant flames, the signe of wrauth awak't: nor with less dread the loud ethereal trumpet from on high gan blow: at which command the powers militant, that stood for heav'n, in mighty quadrate joyn""d of union irresistible, mov'd on in silence thir bright legions, to the sound of instrumental harmonie that breath'd heroic ardor to advent'rous deeds under thir god-like leaders, in the cause of god and his messiah. on they move indissolubly firm; nor obvious hill, nor streit'ning vale, nor wood, nor stream divides thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground thir march was, and the passive air upbore thir nimble tread, as when the total kind of birds in orderly array on wing came summond over eden to receive thir names of thee; so over many a tract of heav'n they march'd, and many a province wide tenfold the length of this terrene: at last farr in th' horizon to the north appeer'd from skirt to skirt a fierie region, stretcht in battailous aspect, and neerer view bristl'd with upright beams innumerable of rigid spears, and helmets throng'd, and shields various, with boastful argument portraid, the banded powers of satan hasting on with furious expedition; for they weend that self same day by fight, or by surprize to win the mount of god, and on his throne to set the envier of his state, the proud aspirer, but thir thoughts prov'd fond and vain in the mid way: though strange to us it seemd at first, that angel should with angel warr, and in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet so oft in festivals of joy and love unanimous, as sons of one great sire hymning th' eternal father: but the shout of battel now began, and rushing sound of onset ended soon each milder thought. high in the midst exalted as a god th' apostat in his sun-bright chariot sate idol of majestie divine, enclos'd with flaming cherubim, and golden shields; then lighted from his gorgeous throne, for now 'twixt host and host but narrow space was left, a dreadful intervall, and front to front presented stood in terrible array of hideous length: before the cloudie van, on the rough edge of battel ere it joyn,d, satan with vast and haughtie strides advanc't, came towring, armd in adamant and gold; abdiel that sight endur'd not, where he stood among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds, and thus his own undaunted heart explores. o heav'n! that such resemblance of the highest should yet remain, where faith and realtie remain not; wherfore should not strength and might there fail where vertue fails, or weakest prove where boldest; though to sight unconquerable? his puissance, trusting in th' almightie's aide, i mean to try, whose reason i have tri'd unsound and false; nor is it aught but just, that he who in debate of truth hath won, should win in arms, in both disputes alike victor; though brutish that contest and foule, when reason hath to deal with force, yet so most reason is that reason overcome. so pondering, and from his armed peers forth stepping opposite, half way he met his daring foe, at this prevention more incens't, and thus securely him defi'd. proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht the highth of thy aspiring unoppos'd, the throne of god unguarded, and his side abandond at the terror of thy power or potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain against th' omnipotent to rise in arms; who out of smallest things could without end have rais'd incessant armies to defeat thy folly; or with solitarie hand reaching beyond all limit at one blow unaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd thy legions under darkness; but thou seest all are not of thy train; there be who faith prefer, and pietie to god, though then to thee not visible, when i alone seemd in thy world erroneous to dissent from all: my sect thou seest, now learn too late how few somtimes may know, when thousands err. whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance thus answerd. ill for thee, but in wisht houre of my revenge, first sought for thou returnst from flight, seditious angel, to receave thy merited reward, the first assay of this right hand provok't, since first that tongue inspir'd with contradiction durst oppose a third part of the gods, in synod met thir deities to assert, who while they feel vigour divine within them, can allow omnipotence to none. but well thou comst before thy fellows, ambitious to win from me som plume, that thy success may show destruction to the rest: this pause between (unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know; at first i thought that libertie and heav'n to heav'nly soules had bin all one; but now i see that most through sloth had rather serve, ministring spirits, traind up in feast and song; such hast thou arm'd, the ministrelsie of heav'n, servilitie with freedom to contend, as both thir deeds compar'd this day shall prove. to whom in brief thus abdiel stern repli'd. apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find of erring, from the path of truth remote: unjustly thou deprav'st it with the name of servitude to serve whom god ordains, or nature; god and nature bid the same, when he who rules is worthiest, and excells them whom he governs. this is servitude, to serve th' unwise, or him who hath rebelld against his worthier, as thine now serve thee, thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall'd; yet leudly dar'st our ministring upbraid. reign thou in hell thy kingdom, let mee serve in heav'n god ever blest, and his divine behests obey, worthiest to be obey'd, yet chains in hell, not realms expect: mean while from mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight, this greeting on thy impious crest receive. so saying, a noble stroke he lifted high, which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell on the proud crest of satan, that no sight, nor motion of swift thought, less could his shield such ruin intercept: ten paces huge he back recoild; the tenth on bended knee his massie spear upstaid; as if on earth winds under ground or waters forcing way sidelong, had push't a mountain from his seat half sunk with all his pines. amazement seis'd the rebel thrones, but greater rage to see thus foil'd thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout, presage of victorie and fierce desire of battel: whereat michael bid sound th' arch-angel trumpet; through the vast of heaven it sounded, and the faithful armies rung hosanna to the highest: nor stood at gaze the adverse legions, nor less hideous joyn'd the horrid shock: now storming furie rose, and clamour such as heard in heav'n till now was never, arms on armour clashing bray'd horrible discord, and the madding wheeles of brazen chariots rag'd; dire was the noise of conflict; over head the dismal hiss of fiery darts in flaming volies flew, and flying vaulted either host with fire. so under fierie cope together rush'd both battels maine, with ruinous assault and inextinguishable rage; all heav'n resounded, and had earth bin then, all earth had to her center shook. what wonder? when millions of fierce encountring angels fought on either side, the least of whom could weild these elements, and arm him with the force of all thir regions: how much more of power armie against armie numberless to raise dreadful combustion warring, and disturb, though not destroy, thir happie native seat; had not th' eternal king omnipotent from his strong hold of heav'n high over-rul'd and limited thir might; though numberd such as each divided legion might have seemd a numerous host, in strength each armed hand a legion; led in fight, yet leader seemd each warriour single as in chief, expert when to advance, or stand, or turn the sway of battel, open when, and when to close the ridges of grim warr; no thought of flight, none of retreat, no unbecoming deed that argu'd fear; each on himself reli'd, as onely in his arm the moment lay of victorie; deeds of eternal fame were don, but infinite: for wide was spred that warr and various; somtimes on firm ground a standing fight, then soaring on main wing tormented all the air; all air seemd then conflicting fire: long time in eeven scale the battel hung; till satan, who that day prodigious power had shewn, and met in armes no equal, raunging through the dire attack of fighting seraphim confus'd, at length saw where the sword of michael smote, and fell'd squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down wide wasting; such destruction to withstand he hasted, and oppos'd the rockie orb of tenfold adamant, his ample shield a vast circumference: at his approach the great arch-angel from his warlike toile surceas'd, and glad as hoping here to end intestine war in heav'n, the arch foe subdu'd or captive drag'd in chains, with hostile frown and visage all enflam'd first thus began. author of evil, unknown till thy revolt, unnam'd in heav'n, now plenteous, as thou seest these acts of hateful strife, hateful to all, though heaviest by just measure on thy self and thy adherents: how hast thou disturb d heav'ns blessed peace, and into nature brought miserie, uncreated till the crime of thy rebellion? how hast thou instill'd thy malice into thousands, once upright and faithful, now prov'd false. but think not here to trouble holy rest; heav'n casts thee out from all her confines. heav'n the seat of bliss brooks not the works of violence and warr. hence then, and evil go with thee along thy ofspring, to the place of evil, hell, thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles, ere this avenging sword begin thy doome, or som more sudden vengeance wing'd from god precipitate thee with augmented paine. so spake the prince of angels; to whom thus the adversarie. nor think thou with wind of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds thou canst not. hast thou turnd the least of these to flight, or if to fall, but that they rise unvanquisht, easier to transact with mee that thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats to chase me hence? erre not that so shall end the strife which thou call'st evil, but wee style the strife of glorie: which we mean to win, or turn this heav'n it self into the hell thou fablest, here however to dwell free, if not to reign: mean while thy utmost force, and join him nam'd almighty to thy aid, i flie not, but have sought thee farr and nigh. they ended parle, and both addrest for fight unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue of angels, can relate, or to what things liken on earth conspicuous, that may lift human imagination to such highth of godlike power: for likest gods they seemd, stood they or mov'd, in stature, motion, arms fit to decide the empire of great heav'n. now wav'd thir fierie swords, and in the aire made horrid circles; two broad suns thir shields blaz'd opposite, while expectation stood in horror; from each hand with speed retir'd where erst was thickest fight, th' angelic throng, and left large field, unsafe within the wind of such commotion, such as to set forth great things by small, if natures concord broke, among the constellations warr were sprung, two planets rushing from aspect maligne of fiercest opposition in mid skie, should combat, and thir jarring sphears confound. together both with next to almightie arme, uplifted imminent one stroke they aim'd that might determine, and not need repeate, as not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd in might or swift prevention; but the sword of michael from the armorie of god was giv'n him temperd so, that neither keen nor solid might resist that edge: it met the sword of satan with steep force to smite descending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid, but with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar'd all his right side; then satan first knew pain, and writh'd him to and fro convolv'd; so sore the griding sword with discontinuous wound pass'd through him, but th' ethereal substance clos'd not long divisible, and from the gash a stream of nectarous humor issuing flow'd sanguin, such as celestial spirits may bleed, and all his armour staind ere while so bright. forthwith on all sides to his aide was run by angels many and strong, who interpos'd defence, while others bore him on thir shields back to his chariot; where it stood retir'd from off the files of warr; there they him laid gnashing for anguish and despite and shame to find himself not matchless, and his pride humbl'd by such rebuke, so farr beneath his confidence to equal god in power. yet soon he heal'd; for spirits that live throughout vital in every part, not as frail man in entrailes, heart or head, liver or reines; cannot but by annihilating die; nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound receive, no more then can the fluid aire: all heart they live, all head, all eye, all eare, all intellect, all sense, and as they please, they limb themselves, and colour, shape or size assume, as likes them best, condense or rare. mean while in other parts like deeds deservd memorial, where the might of gabriel fought, and with fierce ensignes pierc'd the deep array of moloc furious king, who him defi'd, and at his chariot wheeles to drag him bound threatn'd, nor from the holie one of heav'n refrein'd his tongue blasphemous; but anon down clov'n to the waste, with shatterd armes and uncouth paine fled bellowing. on each wing uriel and raphael his vaunting foe, though huge, and in a rock of diamond armd, vanquish'd adramelec, and asmadai, two potent thrones, that to be less then gods disdain'd, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight, mangl'd with gastly wounds through plate and maile, nor stood unmindful abdiel to annoy the atheist crew, but with redoubl'd blow ariel and arioc, and the violence of ramiel scorcht and blasted overthrew. i might relate of thousands, and thir names eternize here on earth; but those elect angels contented with thir fame in heav'n seek not the praise of men: the other sort in might though wondrous and in acts of warr, nor of renown less eager, yet by doome canceld from heav'n and sacred memorie, nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell. for strength from truth divided and from just, illaudable, naught merits but dispraise and ignominie, yet to glorie aspires vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame: therfore eternal silence be thir doome. and now thir mightiest quelld, the battel swerv'd, with many an inrode gor'd; deformed rout enter'd, and foul disorder; all the ground with shiverd armour strow'n, and on a heap chariot and charioter lay overturnd and fierie foaming steeds; what stood, recoyld orewearied, through the faint satanic host defensive scarse, or with pale fear surpris'd, then first with fear surpris'd and sense of paine fled ignominious, to such evil brought by sin of disobedience, till that hour not liable to fear or flight or paine. far otherwise th' inviolable saints in cubic phalanx firm advanc't entire, invulnerable, impenitrably arm'd: such high advantages thir innocence gave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd, not to have disobei'd; in fight they stood unwearied, unobnoxious to be pain'd by wound, though from thir place by violence mov'd. now night her course began, and over heav'n inducing darkness, grateful truce impos'd, and silence on the odious dinn of warr: under her cloudie covert both retir'd, victor and vanquisht: on the foughten field michael and his angels prevalent encamping, plac'd in guard thir watches round, cherubic waving fires: on th' other part satan with his rebellious disappeerd, far in the dark dislodg'd, and void of rest, his potentates to councel call'd by night; and in the midst thus undismai'd began. o now in danger tri'd, now known in armes not to be overpowerd, companions deare, found worthy not of libertie alone, too mean pretense, but what we more affect, honour, dominion, glorie, and renowne, who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight (and if one day, why not eternal dayes?) what heavens lord had powerfullest to send against us from about his throne, and judg'd sufficient to subdue us to his will, but proves not so: then fallible, it seems, of future we may deem him, though till now omniscient thought. true is, less firmly arm'd, some disadvantage we endur'd and paine, till now not known, but known as soon contemnd, since now we find this our empyreal form incapable of mortal injurie imperishable, and though peirc'd with wound, soon closing, and by native vigour heal'd. of evil then so small as easie think the remedie; perhaps more valid armes, weapons more violent, when next we meet, may serve to better us, and worse our foes, or equal what between us made the odds, in nature none: if other hidden cause left them superiour, while we can preserve unhurt our mindes, and understanding sound, due search and consultation will disclose. he sat; and in th' assembly next upstood nisroc of principalities the prime; as one he stood escap't from cruel fight, sore toild, his riv'n armes to havoc hewn, and cioudie in aspect thus answering spake. deliverer from new lords, leader to free enjoyment of our right as gods; yet hard for gods, and too unequal work we find against unequal armes to fight in paine, against unpaind, impassive; from which evil ruin must needs ensue; for what availes valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands of mightiest. sense of pleasure we may well spare out of life perhaps, and not repine, but live content, which is the calmest life: but pain is perfet miserie, the worst of evils, and excessive, overturnes all patience. he who therefore can invent with what more forcible we may offend our yet unwounded enemies, or arme our selves with like defence, to me deserves no less then for deliverance what we owe. whereto with look compos'd satan repli'd. not uninvented that, which thou aright believst so main to our success, i bring; which of us who beholds the bright surface of this ethereous mould whereon we stand, this continent of spacious heav'n, adornd with plant, fruit, flour ambrosial, gemms & gold, whose eye so superficially surveyes these things, as not to mind from whence they grow deep under ground, materials dark and crude, of spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht with heav'ns ray, and temperd they shoot forth so beauteous, op'ning to the ambient light. these in thir dark nativitie the deep shall yield us pregnant with infernal flame, which into hallow engins long and round thick-rammd, at th' other bore with touch of fire dilated and infuriate shall send forth from far with thundring noise among our foes such implements of mischief as shall dash to pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd the thunderer of his only dreaded bolt. nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne, effect shall end our wish. mean while revive; abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind think nothing hard, much less to be despaird. he ended, and his words thir drooping chere enlightn'd, and thir languisht hope reviv'd. th' invention all admir'd, and each, how hee to be th' inventer miss'd, so easie it seemd once found, which yet unfound most would have thought impossible: yet haply of thy race in future dayes, if malice should aboun, some one intent on mischief, or inspir'd with dev'lish machination might devise like instrument to plague the sons of men for sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent. forthwith from councel to the work they flew, none arguing stood, innumerable hands were ready, in a moment up they turnd wide the celestial soile, and saw beneath th' originals of nature in thir crude conception; sulphurous and nitrous foame they found, they mingl'd, and with suttle art, concocted and adusted they reduc'd to blackest grain, and into store convey'd: part hidd'n veins diggd up (nor hath this earth entrails unlike) of mineral and stone, whereof to found thir engins and thir balls of missive ruin; part incentive reed provide, pernicious with one touch to fire. so all ere day-spring, under conscious night secret they finish'd, and in order set, with silent circumspection unespi'd. now when fair morn orient in heav'n appeerd up rose the victor angels, and to arms the matin trumpet sung: in arms they stood of golden panoplie, refulgent host, soon banded; others from the dawning hills lookd round, and scouts each coast light-armed scoure, each quarter, to descrie the distant foe, where lodg'd, or whither fled, or if for fight, in motion or in alt: him soon they met under spred ensignes moving nigh, in slow but firm battalion; back with speediest sail zophiel, of cherubim the swiftest wing, came flying, and in mid aire aloud thus cri'd. arme, warriours, arme for fight, the foe at hand, whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit this day, fear not his flight; so thick a cloud he comes, and settl'd in his face i see sad resolution and secure: let each his adamantine coat gird well, and each fit well his helme, gripe fast his orbed shield, born eevn or high, for this day will pour down, if i conjecture aught, no drizling showr, but ratling storm of arrows barbd with fire. so warnd he them aware themselves, and soon in order, quit of all impediment; instant without disturb they took allarm, and onward move embattelld; when behold not distant far with heavie pace the foe approaching gross and huge; in hollow cube training his devilish enginrie, impal'd on every side with shaddowing squadrons deep, to hide the fraud. at interview both stood a while, but suddenly at head appeerd satan: and thus was heard commanding loud. vanguard, to right and left the front unfould; that all may see who hate us, how we seek peace and composure, and with open brest stand readie to receive them, if they like our overture, and turn not back perverse; but that i doubt, however witness heaven, heav'n witness thou anon, while we discharge freely our part; yee who appointed stand do as you have in charge, and briefly touch what we propound, and loud that all may hear. so scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce had ended; when to right and left the front divided, and to either flank retir'd. which to our eyes discoverd new and strange, a triple mounted row of pillars laid on wheels (for like to pillars most they seem'd or hollow'd bodies made of oak or firr with branches lopt, in wood or mountain fell'd) brass, iron, stonie mould, had not thir mouthes with hideous orifice gap't on us wide, portending hollow truce; at each behind a seraph stood, and in his hand a reed stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense, collected stood within our thoughts amus'd, not long, for sudden all at once thir reeds put forth, and to a narrow vent appli'd with nicest touch. immediate in a flame, but soon obscur'd with smoak, all heav'n appeerd, from those deep throated engins belcht, whose roar emboweld with outragious noise the air, and all her entrails tore, disgorging foule thir devilish glut, chaind thunderbolts and hail of iron globes, which on the victor host level'd, with such impetuous furie smote, that whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand, though standing else as rocks, but down they fell by thousands, angel on arch-angel rowl'd; the sooner for thir arms, unarm'd they might have easily as spirits evaded swift by quick contraction or remove; but now foule dissipation follow'd and forc't rout; nor serv'd it to relax thir serried files. what should they do? if on they rusht, repulse repeated, and indecent overthrow doubl'd, would render them yet more despis'd, and to thir foes a laughter; for in view stood rankt of seraphim another row in posture to displode thir second tire of thunder: back defeated to return they worse abhorr'd. satan beheld thir plight, and to his mates thus in derision call'd. o friends, why come not on these victors proud? ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee, to entertain them fair with open front and brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms of composition, strait they chang'd thir minds, flew off, and into strange vagaries fell, as they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps for joy of offerd peace: but i suppose if our proposals once again were heard we should compel them to a quick result. to whom thus belial in like gamesom mood, leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight, of hard contents, and full of force urg'd home, such as we might perceive amus'd them all, and stumbl'd many, who receives them right, had need from head to foot well understand; not understood, this gift they have besides, they shew us when our foes walk not upright. so they among themselves in pleasant veine stood scoffing, highthn'd in thir thoughts beyond all doubt of victorie, eternal might to match with thir inventions they presum'd so easie, and of his thunder made a scorn, and all his host derided, while they stood a while in trouble; but they stood not long, rage prompted them at length, and found them arms against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. forthwith (behold the excellence, the power which god hath in his mighty angels plac'd) thir arms away they threw, and to the hills (for earth hath this variety from heav'n of pleasure situate in hill and dale) light as the lightning glimps they ran, they flew, from thir foundations loosning to and fro they pluckt the seated hills with all thir load, rocks, waters, woods, and by the shaggie tops up lifting bore them in thir hands: amaze, be sure, and terrour seis'd the rebel host, when coming towards them so dread they saw the bottom of the mountains upward turn'd, till on those cursed engins triple-row they saw them whelm'd, and all thir confidence under the weight of mountains buried deep, themselves invaded next, and on thir heads main promontories flung, which in the air came shadowing, and opprest whole legions arm'd, thir armor help'd thir harm, crush't in and bruis'd into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain implacable, and many a dolorous groan, long strugling underneath, ere they could wind out of such prison, though spirits of purest light, purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. the rest in imitation to like armes betook them, and the neighbouring hills uptore; so hills amid the air encounterd hills hurl'd to and fro with jaculation dire that under ground, they fought in dismal shade; infernal noise; warr seem'd a civil game to this uproar; horrid confusion heapt upon confusion rose: and now all heav'n had gon to wrack, with ruin overspred, had not th' almightie father where he sits shrin'd in his sanctuarie of heav'n secure, consulting on the sum of things, foreseen this tumult, and permitted all, advis'd: that his great purpose he might so fulfill, to honour his anointed son aveng'd upon his enemies, and to declare all power on him transferr'd: whence to his son th' assessor of his throne he thus began. effulgence of my glorie, son belov'd, son in whose face invisible is beheld visibly, what by deitie i am, and in whose hand what by decree i doe, second omnipotence, two dayes are past, two dayes, as we compute the dayes of heav'n, since michael and his powers went forth to tame these disobedient; sore hath been thir fight, as likeliest was, when two such foes met arm'd; for to themselves i left them, and thou knowst, equal in their creation they were form'd, save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought insensibly, for i suspend thir doom; whence in perpetual fight they needs must last endless, and no solution will be found: warr wearied hath perform'd what warr can do, and to disorder'd rage let loose the reines, with mountains as with weapons arm'd, which makes wild work in heav'n, and dangerous to the maine. two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine; for thee i have ordain'd it, and thus farr have sufferd, that the glorie may be thine of ending this great warr, since none but thou can end it. into thee such vertue and grace immense i have transfus'd, that all may know in heav'n and hell thy power above compare, and this perverse commotion governd thus, to manifest thee worthiest to be heir of all things, to be heir and to be king by sacred unction, thy deserved right. go then thou mightiest in thy fathers might, ascend my chariot, guide the rapid wheeles that shake heav'ns basis, bring forth all my warr, my bow and thunder, my almightie arms gird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh; pursue these sons of darkness, drive them out from all heav'ns bounds into the utter deep: there let them learn, as likes them, to despise god and messiah his anointed king. he said, and on his son with rayes direct shon full, he all his father full expresst ineffably into his face receiv'd, and thus the filial godhead answering spake. o father, o supream of heav'nly thrones, first, highest, holiest, best, thou alwayes seekst to glorifie thy son, i alwayes thee, as is most just; this i my glorie account, my exaltation, and my whole delight, that thou in me well pleas'd, declarst thy will fulfill'd, which to fulfil is all my bliss. scepter and power, thy giving, i assume, and gladlier shall resign, when in the end thou shalt be all in all, and i in thee for ever, and in mee all whom thou lov'st: but whom thou hat'st, i hate, and can put on thy terrors, as i put thy mildness on, image of thee in all things; and shall soon, armd with thy might, rid heav'n of these rebell'd, to thir prepar'd ill mansion driven down to chains of darkness, and th' undying worm, that from thy just obedience could revolt, whom to obey is happiness entire. then shall thy saints unmixt, and from th' impure farr separate, circling thy holy mount unfained halleluiahs to thee sing, hymns of high praise, and i among them chief. so said, he o're his scepter bowing, rose from the right hand of glorie where he sate, and the third sacred morn began to shine dawning through heav'n: forth rush'd with whirlwind sound the chariot of paternal deitie, flashing thick flames, wheele within wheele undrawn, it self instinct with spirit, but convoyd by four cherubic shapes, four faces each had wondrous, as with starrs thir bodies all and wings were set with eyes, with eyes the wheels of beril, and careering fires between; over thir heads a chrystal firmament, whereon a saphir throne, inlaid with pure amber, and colours of the showrie arch. hee in celestial panoplie all armd of radiant urim, work divinely wrought, ascended, at his right hand victorie sate eagle-wing'd, beside him hung his bow and quiver with three-bolted thunder stor'd, and from about him fierce effusion rowld of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire; attended with ten thousand thousand saints, he onward came, farr off his coming shon, and twentie thousand (i thir number heard) chariots of god, half on each hand were seen: hee on the wings of cherub rode sublime on the chrystallin skie, in saphir thron'd. illustrious farr and wide, but by his own first seen, them unexpected joy surpriz'd, when the great ensign of messiah blaz'd aloft by angels born, his sign in heav'n: under whose conduct michael soon reduc'd his armie, circumfus'd on either wing, under thir head imbodied all in one. before him power divine his way prepar'd; at his command the uprooted hills retir'd each to his place, they heard his voice and went obsequious, heav'n his wonted face renewd, and with fresh flourets hill and valley smil'd. this saw his hapless foes but stood obdur'd, and to rebellious fight rallied thir powers insensate, hope conceiving from despair. in heav'nly spirits could such perverseness dwell? but to convince the proud what signs availe, or wonders move th' obdurate to relent? they hard'nd more by what might most reclame, grieving to see his glorie, at the sight took envie, and aspiring to his highth, stood reimbattell'd fierce, by force or fraud weening to prosper, and at length prevaile against god and messiah, or to fall in universal ruin last, and now to final battel drew, disdaining flight, or faint retreat; when the great son of god to all his host on either hand thus spake. stand still in bright array ye saints, here stand ye angels arm'd, this day from battel rest; faithful hath been your warfare, and of god accepted, fearless in his righteous cause, and as ye have receivd, so have ye don invincibly; but of this cursed crew the punishment to other hand belongs, vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints; number to this dayes work is not ordain'd nor multitude, stand onely and behold gods indignation on these godless pourd by mee, not you but mee they have despis'd, yet envied; against mee is all thir rage, because the father, t' whom in heav'n supream kingdom and power and glorie appertains, hath honourd me according to his will. therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig'n'd; that they may have thir wish, to trie with mee in battel which the stronger proves, they all, or i alone against them, since by strength they measure all, of other excellence not emulous, nor care who them excells; nor other strife with them do i voutsafe. so spake the son, and into terrour chang'd his count'nance too severe to be beheld and full of wrauth bent on his enemies. at once the four spred out thir starrie wings with dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbes of his fierce chariot rowld, as with the sound of torrent floods, or of a numerous host. hee on his impious foes right onward drove, gloomie as night; under his burning wheeles the stedfast empyrean shook throughout, all but the throne it self of god. full soon among them he arriv'd; in his right hand grasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent before him, such as in thir soules infix'd plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost, all courage; down thir idle weapons drop'd; o're shields and helmes, and helmed heads he rode of thrones and mighty seraphim prostrate, that wisht the mountains now might be again thrown on them as a shelter from his ire. nor less on either side tempestuous fell his arrows, from the fourfold-visag'd foure, distinct with eyes, and from the living wheels distinct alike with multitude of eyes, one spirit in them rul'd, and every eye glar'd lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire among th' accurst, that witherd all thir strength, and of thir wonted vigour left them draind, exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall'n. yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd his thunder in mid volie, for he meant not to destroy, but root them out of heav'n: the overthrown he rais'd, and as a heard of goats or timerous flock together throngd drove them before him thunder-struck, pursu'd with terrors and with furies to the bounds and chrystal wall of heav'n, which op'ning wide, rowld inward, and a spacious gap disclos'd into the wastful deep;

but strict fate had cast too deep her dark foundations, and too fast had bound. nine dayes they fell; confounded chaos roard, and felt tenfold confusion in thir fall through his wilde anarchie, so huge a rout incumberd him with ruin: hell at last yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos'd, hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire unquenchable, the house of woe and paine. disburd'nd heav'n rejoic'd, and soon repaird her mural breach, returning whence it rowld. sole victor from th' expulsion of his foes messiah his triumphal chariot turnd: to meet him all his saints, who silent stood eye witnesses of his almightie acts, with jubilie advanc'd;

the discord which befel, and warr in heav'n among th' angelic powers, and the deep fall of those too high aspiring, who rebelld with satan, hee who envies now thy state, who now is plotting how he may seduce thee also from obedience, that with him bereavd of happiness thou maist partake his punishment, eternal miserie; which would be all his solace and revenge, as a despite don against the most high, thee once to gaine companion of his woe. but list'n not to his temptations, warne thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard by terrible example the reward of disobedience;

11702,12984,"<line> <line>i ere frost-flower and snow-blossom faded and fell, and the splendour of winter had passed out of sight, the ways of the woodlands were fairer and stranger than dreams that fulfil us in sleep with delight; the breath of the mouths of the winds had hardened on tree-tops and branches that glittered and swayed such wonders and glories of blossomlike snow or of frost that outlightens all flowers till it fade that the sea was not lovelier than here was the land, nor the night than the day, nor the day than the night, nor the winter sublimer with storm than the spring: such mirth had the madness and might in thee made, march, master of winds, bright minstrel and marshal of storms that enkindle the season they smite. ii and now that the rage of thy rapture is satiate with revel and ravin and spoil of the snow, and the branches it brightened are broken, and shattered the tree-tops that only thy wrath could lay low, how should not thy lovers rejoice in thee, leader and lord of the year that exults to be born so strong in thy strength and so glad of thy gladness whose laughter puts winter and sorrow to scorn? thou hast shaken the snows from thy wings, and the frost on thy forehead is molten: thy lips are aglow as a lover's that kindle with kissing, and earth, with her raiment and tresses yet wasted and torn, takes breath as she smiles in the grasp of thy passion to feel through her spirit the sense of thee flow. iii fain, fain would we see but again for an hour what the wind and the sun have dispelled and consumed, those full deep swan-soft feathers of snow with whose luminous burden the branches implumed hung heavily, curved as a half-bent bow, and fledged not as birds are, but petalled as flowers, each tree-top and branchlet a pinnacle jewelled and carved, or a fountain that shines as it showers, but fixed as a fountain is fixed not, and wrought not to last till by time or by tempest entombed, as a pinnacle carven and gilded of men: for the date of its doom is no more than an hour's, one hour of the sun's when the warm wind wakes him to wither the snow-flowers that froze as they bloomed. iv as the sunshine quenches the snowshine; as april subdues thee, and yields up his kingdom to may; so time overcomes the regret that is born of delight as it passes in passion away, and leaves but a dream for desire to rejoice in or mourn for with tears or thanksgivings; but thou, bright god that art gone from us, maddest and gladdest of months, to what goal hast thou gone from us now? for somewhere surely the storm of thy laughter that lightens, the beat of thy wings that play, must flame as a fire through the world, and the heavens that we know not rejoice in thee: surely thy brow hath lost not its radiance of empire, thy spirit the joy that impelled it on quest as for prey. v are thy feet on the ways of the limitless waters, thy wings on the winds of the waste north sea? are the fires of the false north dawn over heavens where summer is stormful and strong like thee now bright in the sight of thine eyes? are the bastions of icebergs assailed by the blast of thy breath? is it march with the wild north world when april is waning? the word that the changed year saith, is it echoed to northward with rapture of passion reiterate from spirits triumphant as we whose hearts were uplift at the blast of thy clarions as men's rearisen from a sleep that was death and kindled to life that was one with the world's and with thine? hast thou set not the whole world free? vi for the breath of thy lips is freedom, and freedom's the sense of thy spirit, the sound of thy song, glad god of the north-east wind, whose heart is as high as the hands of thy kingdom are strong, thy kingdom whose empire is terror and joy, twin-featured and fruitful of births divine, days lit with the flame of the lamps of the flowers, and nights that are drunken with dew for wine, and sleep not for joy of the stars that deepen and quicken, a denser and fierier throng, and the world that thy breath bade whiten and tremble rejoices at heart as they strengthen and shine, and earth gives thanks for the glory bequeathed her, and knows of thy reign that it wrought not wrong. vii thy spirit is quenched not, albeit we behold not thy face in the crown of the steep sky's arch, and the bold first buds of the whin wax golden, and witness arise of the thorn and the larch: wild april, enkindled to laughter and storm by the kiss of the wildest of winds that blow, calls loud on his brother for witness; his hands that were laden with blossom are sprinkled with snow, and his lips breathe winter, and laugh, and relent; and the live woods feel not the frost's flame parch; for the flame of the spring that consumes not but quickens is felt at the heart of the forest aglow, and the sparks that enkindled and fed it were strewn from the hands of the gods of the winds of march. <line>","nature,spring,weather"

alas, i am planting, not praying. <line> <line>we both rise at five-thirty, after dreaming of weeds. <line> <line>louis describes to me endless vivid deeps: <line> <line>dreams of nettle-stings, stabs from the citron’s thorns, <line> <line>the ants’ fiery bites, the resistance of mud and slime, <line> <line>the evasions of wormy roots, the dead weight of heat <line> <line>in the sudden puffs of air ... louis writes till nine, <line> <line>then if he’s well enough, he helps with the weeding. <line> <line>he writes colvin, keeper of prints at the british museum, <line> <line>“i know pleasure still ... with a thousand faces, <line> <line>none perfect, a thousand tongues, all broken, <line> <line>a thousand hands, all with scratching nails ... <line> <line>high among joys, i place this delight of weeding, <line> <line>out here alone by the garrulous water, under the silence <line> <line>of the high wind, broken by sounds of birds.” <line> <line>the shock of bird-calls, laughing and whistling!

11756,13087,"<line> <line>there was a roaring in the wind all night; the rain came heavily and fell in floods; but now the sun is rising calm and bright; the birds are singing in the distant woods; over his own sweet voice the stock-dove broods; the jay makes answer as the magpie chatters; and all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters. all things that love the sun are out of doors; the sky rejoices in the morning's birth; the grass is bright with rain-drops;—on the moors the hare is running races in her mirth; and with her feet she from the plashy earth raises a mist, that, glittering in the sun, runs with her all the way, wherever she doth run. i was a traveller then upon the moor; i saw the hare that raced about with joy; i heard the woods and distant waters roar; or heard them not, as happy as a boy: the pleasant season did my heart employ: my old remembrances went from me wholly; and all the ways of men, so vain and melancholy. but, as it sometimes chanceth, from the might of joys in minds that can no further go, as high as we have mounted in delight in our dejection do we sink as low; to me that morning did it happen so; and fears and fancies thick upon me came; dim sadness—and blind thoughts, i knew not, nor could name. i heard the sky-lark warbling in the sky; and i bethought me of the playful hare: even such a happy child of earth am i; even as these blissful creatures do i fare; far from the world i walk, and from all care; but there may come another day to me— solitude, pain of heart, distress, and poverty. my whole life i have lived in pleasant thought, as if life's business were a summer mood; as if all needful things would come unsought to genial faith, still rich in genial good; but how can he expect that others should build for him, sow for him, and at his call love him, who for himself will take no heed at all? i thought of chatterton, the marvellous boy, the sleepless soul that perished in his pride; of him who walked in glory and in joy following his plough, along the mountain-side: by our own spirits are we deified: we poets in our youth begin in gladness; but thereof come in the end despondency and madness. now, whether it were by peculiar grace, a leading from above, a something given, yet it befell that, in this lonely place, when i with these untoward thoughts had striven, beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven i saw a man before me unawares: the oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs. as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence; wonder to all who do the same espy, by what means it could thither come, and whence; so that it seems a thing endued with sense: like a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself; such seemed this man, not all alive nor dead, nor all asleep—in his extreme old age: his body was bent double, feet and head coming together in life's pilgrimage; as if some dire constraint of pain, or rage of sickness felt by him in times long past, a more than human weight upon his frame had cast. himself he propped, limbs, body, and pale face, upon a long grey staff of shaven wood: and, still as i drew near with gentle pace, upon the margin of that moorish flood motionless as a cloud the old man stood, that heareth not the loud winds when they call, and moveth all together, if it move at all. at length, himself unsettling, he the pond stirred with his staff, and fixedly did look upon the muddy water, which he conned, as if he had been reading in a book: and now a stranger's privilege i took; and, drawing to his side, to him did say, ""this morning gives us promise of a glorious day."" a gentle answer did the old man make, in courteous speech which forth he slowly drew: and him with further words i thus bespake, ""what occupation do you there pursue? this is a lonesome place for one like you."" ere he replied, a flash of mild surprise broke from the sable orbs of his yet-vivid eyes. his words came feebly, from a feeble chest, but each in solemn order followed each, with something of a lofty utterance drest— choice word and measured phrase, above the reach of ordinary men; a stately speech; such as grave livers do in scotland use, religious men, who give to god and man their dues. he told, that to these waters he had come to gather leeches, being old and poor: employment hazardous and wearisome! and he had many hardships to endure: from pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor; housing, with god's good help, by choice or chance; and in this way he gained an honest maintenance. the old man still stood talking by my side; but now his voice to me was like a stream scarce heard; nor word from word could i divide; and the whole body of the man did seem like one whom i had met with in a dream; or like a man from some far region sent, to give me human strength, by apt admonishment. my former thoughts returned: the fear that kills; and hope that is unwilling to be fed; cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills; and mighty poets in their misery dead. —perplexed, and longing to be comforted, my question eagerly did i renew, ""how is it that you live, and what is it you do?"" he with a smile did then his words repeat; and said that, gathering leeches, far and wide he travelled; stirring thus about his feet the waters of the pools where they abide. ""once i could meet with them on every side; but they have dwindled long by slow decay; yet still i persevere, and find them where i may."" while he was talking thus, the lonely place, the old man's shape, and speech—all troubled me: in my mind's eye i seemed to see him pace about the weary moors continually, wandering about alone and silently. while i these thoughts within myself pursued, he, having made a pause, the same discourse renewed. and soon with this he other matter blended, cheerfully uttered, with demeanour kind, but stately in the main; and, when he ended, i could have laughed myself to scorn to find in that decrepit man so firm a mind. ""god,"" said i, ""be my help and stay secure; i'll think of the leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!"" <line>","living,the mind,activities,jobs & working,travels & journeys,nature,landscapes & pastorals,arts & sciences,poetry & poets"

(in maximum, they are made of metal.) the definition of the face is a memory. <line> <line> <line>vivid to me is debbie saying that at the trial of her mother's murderer, she looked around and saw the people sitting on separate sides of the courtroom, the way they do at a wedding, the bride's people, the groom's people, and she tried to take in the damage radiating through the distinct lines—the perpetrator's side, the victim's side. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>vivid to me is leaving angola after the first visit and debbie asking what i thought, and i said (too fast) i thought those were the nicest people i had ever met, and the ironic laughter it provoked in us both, the car yawing. the obvious truth, people are people. equally, the damage is never limited to perpetrator and victim. also, that the crimes are not the sum of the criminal any more than anyone is entirely separable from their acts. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>i remember an afternoon at the iron pile at transylvania watching the men quietly plait each other's hair between sets at the weight bench. when i asked about a man whose face was severely scarred, a very specific face, with large, direct aquamarine eyes, a guard told me that the man's brother had thrown a tire over his head and set it on fire. this i did not know how to absorb. it was a steaming day; the men were lifting weights and plaiting their hair. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>i remember easter weekend at the women's prison. the day before, a long line formed outside the prison-run beauty shop. inside, the women having their hair fixed were talking back to a soap opera on the small snowy screen. by visiting day the inner courtyard had been transformed into a theme park for the children. a trampoline had been rented, a cotton-candy machine; someone dressed in a bunny suit was organizing an egg hunt. the girls wore starched, flouncy dresses, and the boys white jackets and black, clip-on bow ties. the women were dressed up, too, even the ones shackled at ankle and waist. deborah photographed all day, nonstop. identifiable pictures of children would have to be excluded from publication, but people wanted a keepsake. we left before visiting hours ended. it wasn't our place to be there. it wasn't really in us to be there. <line> <line> <line>remember sitting in the frigid holiday inn bar near st. gabriel, at the end of one visit to the women's prison, staring at the aquarium, not talking. <line> <line> <line>talking to a man who says he has done a lot of time. lot of time. he should write a book, he says. he wants to be a success. ""hollywood, huh, here i come."" <line> <line> <line>talking to a woman who says the one time her dad visited her from the midwest, she asked him to look at her eyes. there was a look she didn't want to get, a faraway look. her father pretended to examine her eyes, then told her they looked like the same old peepers to him. she passed her time reading. same way she passed her childhood. she thought she was going to be an astronomer when she grew up. not a felon. <line> <line> <line>both parents are dead now. of her three sons, one disappeared, one died of suicide, and the third severed contact. <line> <line> <line>one of the inmates at st. gabriel informed me she wouldn't be around for visiting hours tomorrow because she was on the drill team. also, her ex-husband would not be bringing her baby boy to see her. not tomorrow, not ever. <line> <line> <line>the grease burns, i am told by another inmate, are courtesy of her sister. <line> <line> <line>don't walk on the grass, says the sign posted in the inner yard. <line> <line> <line>then there's the bus that leaves from monroe taking visitors to one of four neighboring pens, al derry's prison transport and popcorn balls. evidently, the popcorn balls make it the competitive ride. only in louisiana. <line> <line> <line>after a time. a lot of time. they stop coming. the free-worlders. they are too poor or too busy working or are already looking after others on the outside or their car is broken or they are too worn down or they move too far off or they get old, sick, and die. so the inmates wait for their turn. <line> <line> <line>they aren't going anywhere. they have all the time there is. <line> <line> <line>""the only continuity of our lives,"" wrote malcolm braly, american writer, american lifer, ""was that we had none."" <line> <line> <line>""waiting,"" goes the motto at st. gabriel, ""it's the lciw way."" <line> <line> <line>i wrote a woman and asked whether she ever had any pets. she wrote back: bandit, baby, snobby, elsie, bear (those were the dogs). tiger and fuzzball (the cats), jill, ben, and junior (the coons). and a lot of unnamed fish, hamsters, rabbits, chickens, ducks, geese, guinea pigs, ""and a deer, not really a pet but i finally coaxed to the point she would eat out of my hand."" <line> <line> <line>not to idealize, not to judge, not to exonerate, not to aestheticize immeasurable levels of pain. not to demonize, not anathematize. what i wanted was to unequivocally lay out the real feel of hard time. i wanted it given to understand that when you pass four prisons in less than an hour, the countryside's apparent emptiness is more legible. it is an open, running comment when the only spike in employment statistics is being created by the supply of people crossing the line. <line> <line> <line>i wanted the banter, the idiom, the soft-spoken cadence of louisiana speech to cut through the mass-media myopia. i wanted the heat, the humidity, the fecundity of louisiana to travel right up the body. what i wanted was to convey the sense of normalcy for which humans strive under conditions that are anything but what we in the free world call normal, no matter what we may have done for which we were never charged. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>the world of the prison system springs up adjacent to the free world. as the towns decline, the prisons grow. as industries disappear, prisons proliferate, state-funded prison-building surges are complemented by private-investment promising ""to be an integral component of your corrections strategy,"" according to an industry founder. the interrelation of poverty, illiteracy, substance and physical abuse, mental illness, race, and gender to the prison population is blaring to the naked eye and borne out by the statistics. of the developed nations, only russia aspires to our rate of incarceration. and the big bear is a distant second. ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the warp in the mirror is of our making. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>the popular perception is that art is apart. i insist it is a part of. something not in dispute is that people in prison are apart from. if you can accept—whatever level of discipline and punishment you adhere to momentarily set aside—that the ultimate goal should be to reunite the separated with the larger human enterprise, it might behoove us to see prisoners, among others, as they elect to be seen, in their larger selves. if we go there, if not with our bodies then at least our minds, we are more likely to register the implications. + + + <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>i am going to prison. <line> <line> <line>i am going to visit three prisons in louisiana. <line> <line> <line>i am going on the heels of my

although not feminine, she was maternal. then that thought passed. she shrugged and comforted herself. difficult, celibate, implacable, a final time she assessed the couple of compromised want, aware that nothing blackens the heart like a mariage blanc, and stamped them — mwah! mwah! — with the imprimatur of two kisses each. the relationship lasted three months. they had chosen wrongly, and plausibly they fell apart, like the couple in godard’s le mépris. had she wanted more than a cover? had he covered more than he wanted? the heart, behind its casements, is faceted, pronged, coveted, intricate and known by few. he could not be kept. she withdrew her money. reconciliation occurred after they ceased speaking. on their last night in monaco, she turned to him and wondered if her life had meant anything. he did not answer: he had developed a grace for offering himself to those who found truth difficult. when they left the restaurant, she paid using a heavy, black american express card. each took a doggy bag and smelled of cooked meat. this alignment of opposite sexes had provided solace, and for a time, each had assumed a place, discerned a way to live. indeed, they lived on, never to see each other again, both aware the one had harmed the other: whether intended or not, the act could not be undone. what they recalled, when they recalled, was often wrong, or was it that so much went wrong and that was why they kept recalling? at the mention of monaco, they recounted certain adornments — agapanthus purpling, old men playing boules, and blue yachts tilting on a malachite sea, or were they malachite yachts tilting on a blue sea? wherever they went henceforth — the hôtel du cap, the boboli gardens, or even simple, small places in america — their minds would inexorably turn, and then return, to that interval in monaco, where they saw the truth and the truth was . . . monaco, monaco — frivolous, ridiculous, miniscule principality. it was there they came to know how dangerous beauty could be, how one could disappear into it, and with that dark knowledge they traveled on. each, in their separate lives, always mentioned monaco with deference, out of shyness, yes, but also shame, and that need to abridge the past. do you recognize them? they were not a couple, but they were a pair. tonight the sea pushes against monaco. jewelry store owners don white gloves, lock their doors. the principality has long forgotten the pair. baronesses, marchionesses, and princesses have had their portraits painted and affixed to walls. the narrow, dead-end streets embed themselves into the escarpments like bobby pins. the moon spreads her cape of baubles across the sea with glamorous transience, enlarging behind the dollhouse casino, banks, hotels, feeling into the rooms, fingering the miniatures. <line>","relationships,men & women,social commentaries,cities & urban life"

rummaging the round heart <line> <line>for its divinity and pulse. ezra, nothing of you but the dead. <line> <line>and so, i ran past the possum running through the skull <line> <line>holes of a dead man lying in the fog that licked them <line> <line>into a wet testimony, the possum testifying, too, to their death — <line> <line>coming, going, in ruins and floating out, out, beyond <line> <line>their murders and dropped plates, out beyond the thame-ish <line> <line>rivers and its drowning traditions. and then i looked back <line> <line>and saw ezra. he had come to his cage and could go no farther. <line> <line>“till,” he said. “bring me up from beneath these decks, <line> <line>one slaver to another.” he winked and i winked back, <line> <line>handed him the katydid buzzing in my

a mountain and then a chasm <line> <line>for which there was no bridge and so turned back <line> <line>to find a possum running behind me, and i asked him, <line> <line>dear possum, what do we do with this darkness <line> <line>between us, and the possum said nothing and ran on <line> <line>into the darkness, into the chasm and fell speaking of <line> <line>the end of touch, the desire to forget desire, shadows, <line> <line>the fear in a handful of dust, a woman’s mouth, <line> <line>fear i had known of and visited though now i cringed <line> <line>at the thought of that violence, the

follow or do you fall,” <line> <line>they said. “are you short or is you tall?” <line> <line>and on and on they played, pleasured, and pigeoned <line> <line>with each other, kiting sound and word between them <line> <line>as i have seen lovers do, passing cigarettes and smoke <line> <line>from one mouth to another, the smoke the shared body <line> <line>of a god that has no master or mastering plan <line> <line>other than abiding in darkness, abiding in both <line> <line>its coronation and crucifixion. on and on we walked. <line> <line>and i followed. beyond the bears chortling pears <line> <line>from augustine’s outstretched hand, out beyond the river <line> <line>scissoring the changing maple, its leaves ambering <line> <line>then auburn then green each time a child appeared <line> <line>and touched its trunk. we stopped, watched. i asked <line> <line>who are they. and the one full of light and knives answered, <line> <line>waving at a few who journeyed to the edge of the water <line> <line>but did not wade in. and why don’t they wade in, <line> <line>i asked. she snickered, quieted, then said, <line> <line>“wind and foxes, what was never mine but was and was.” <line> <line>as if she knew i did not understand, continued, “‘the ones <line> <line>i got but did not get,’ the wild hair they could not grow <line> <line>but scratches me now as it did once in a dream. <line> <line>our abortions, louis, our ones given and gave. dem. <line> <line>the ones given all of their years at once. and none <line> <line>or never.” and when she spoke, i saw another come <line>

mountains on whose barren breast the labouring clouds do often rest; meadows trim with daisies pied, shallow brooks, and rivers wide. towers, and battlements it sees bosom'd high in tufted trees, where perhaps some beauty lies, the cynosure of neighbouring eyes. hard by, a cottage chimney smokes, from betwixt two aged oaks, where corydon and thyrsis met, are at their savoury dinner set of herbs, and other country messes, which the neat-handed phyllis dresses; and then in haste her bow'r she leaves, with thestylis to bind the sheaves; or if the earlier season lead to the tann'd haycock in the mead. sometimes with secure delight the upland hamlets will invite, when the merry bells ring round, and the jocund rebecks sound to many a youth, and many a maid, dancing in the chequer'd shade;

that orpheus' self may heave his head from golden slumber on a bed of heap'd elysian flow'rs, and hear such strains as would have won the ear of pluto, to have quite set free his half-regain'd eurydice. these delights if thou canst give, mirth, with thee i mean to live. <line>","nature,landscapes & pastorals,mythology & folklore,greek & roman mythology,heroes & patriotism"

12076,12644,"<line> <line>my hair is grey, but not with years, <line> <line> nor grew it white <line> <line> in a single night, <line>as men's have grown from sudden fears: <line>my limbs are bow'd, though not with toil, <line> <line> but rusted with a vile repose, <line>for they have been a dungeon's spoil, <line> <line> and mine has been the fate of those <line>to whom the goodly earth and air <line>are bann'd, and barr'd—forbidden fare; <line>but this was for my father's faith <line>i suffer'd chains and courted death; <line>that father perish'd at the stake <line>for tenets he would not forsake; <line>and for the same his lineal race <line>in darkness found a dwelling place; <line>we were seven—who now are one, <line> <line> six in youth, and one in age, <line>finish'd as they had begun, <line> <line> proud of persecution's rage; <line>one in fire, and two in field, <line>their belief with blood have seal'd, <line>dying as their father died, <line>for the god their foes denied;— <line>three were in a dungeon cast, <line>of whom this wreck is left the last. <line> <line> there are seven pillars of gothic mould, <line>in chillon's dungeons deep and old, <line>there are seven columns, massy and grey, <line>dim with a dull imprison'd ray, <line>a sunbeam which hath lost its way, <line>and through the crevice and the cleft <line>of the thick wall is fallen and left; <line>creeping o'er the floor so damp, <line>like a marsh's meteor lamp: <line>and in each pillar there is a ring, <line> <line> and in each ring there is a chain; <line>that iron is a cankering thing, <line> <line> for in these limbs its teeth remain, <line>with marks that will not wear away, <line>till i have done with this new day, <line>which now is painful to these eyes, <line>which have not seen the sun so rise <line>for years—i cannot count them o'er, <line>i lost their long and heavy score <line>when my last brother droop'd and died, <line>and i lay living by his side. <line> <line> they chain'd us each to a column stone, <line>and we were three—yet, each alone; <line>we could not move a single pace, <line>we could not see each other's face, <line>but with that pale and livid light <line>that made us strangers in our sight: <line>and thus together—yet apart, <line>fetter'd in hand, but join'd in heart, <line>'twas still some solace in the dearth <line>of the pure elements of earth, <line>to hearken to each other's speech, <line>and each turn comforter to each <line>with some new hope, or legend old, <line>or song heroically bold; <line>but even these at length grew cold. <line>our voices took a dreary tone, <line>an echo of the dungeon stone, <line> <line> a grating sound, not full and free, <line> <line> as they of yore were wont to be: <line> <line> it might be fancy—but to me <line>they never sounded like our own. <line> <line> i was the eldest of the three <line> <line> and to uphold and cheer the rest <line> <line> i ought to do—and did my best— <line>and each did well in his degree. <line> <line> the youngest, whom my father loved, <line>because our mother's brow was given <line>to him, with eyes as blue as heaven— <line> <line> for him my soul was sorely moved: <line>and truly might it be distress'd <line>to see such bird in such a nest; <line>for he was beautiful as day— <line> <line> (when day was beautiful to me <line> <line> as to young eagles, being free)— <line> <line> a polar day, which will not see <line>a sunset till its summer's gone, <line> <line> its sleepless summer of long light, <line>the snow-clad offspring of the sun: <line> <line> and thus he was as pure and bright, <line>and in his natural spirit gay, <line>with tears for nought but others' ills, <line>and then they flow'd like mountain rills, <line>unless he could assuage the woe <line>which he abhorr'd to view below. <line> <line> the other was as pure of mind, <line>but form'd to combat with his kind; <line>strong in his frame, and of a mood <line>which 'gainst the world in war had stood, <line>and perish'd in the foremost rank <line> <line> with joy:—but not in chains to pine: <line>his spirit wither'd with their clank, <line> <line> i saw it silently decline— <line> <line> and so perchance in sooth did mine: <line>but yet i forced it on to cheer <line>those relics of a home so dear. <line>he was a hunter of the hills, <line> <line> had followed there the deer and wolf; <line> <line> to him this dungeon was a gulf, <line>and fetter'd feet the worst of ills. <line> <line> lake leman lies by chillon's walls: <line>a thousand feet in depth below <line>its massy waters meet and flow; <line>thus much the fathom-line was sent <line>from chillon's snow-white battlement, <line> <line> which round about the wave inthralls: <line>a double dungeon wall and wave <line>have made—and like a living grave <line>below the surface of the lake <line>the dark vault lies wherein we lay: <line>we heard it ripple night and day; <line> <line> sounding o'er our heads it knock'd; <line>and i have felt the winter's spray <line>wash through the bars when winds were high <line>and wanton in the happy sky; <line> <line> and then the very rock hath rock'd, <line> <line> and i have felt it shake, unshock'd, <line>because i could have smiled to see <line>the death that would have set me free. <line> <line> i said my nearer brother pined, <line>i said his mighty heart declined, <line>he loathed and put away his food; <line>it was not that 'twas coarse and rude, <line>for we were used to hunter's fare, <line>and for the like had little care: <line>the milk drawn from the mountain goat <line>was changed for water from the moat, <line>our bread was such as captives' tears <line>have moisten'd many a thousand years, <line>since man first pent his fellow men <line>like brutes within an iron den; <line>but what were these to us or him? <line>these wasted not his heart or limb; <line>my brother's soul was of that mould <line>which in a palace had grown cold, <line>had his free breathing been denied <line>the range of the steep mountain's side; <line>but why delay the truth?—he died. <line>i saw, and could not hold his head, <line>nor reach his dying hand—nor dead,— <line>though hard i strove, but strove in vain, <line>to rend and gnash my bonds in twain. <line>he died—and they unlock'd his chain, <line>and scoop'd for him a shallow grave <line>even from the cold earth of our cave. <line>i begg'd them, as a boon, to lay <line>his corse in dust whereon the day <line>might shine—it was a foolish thought, <line>but then within my brain it wrought, <line>that even in death his freeborn breast <line>in such a dungeon could not rest. <line>i might have spared my idle prayer— <line>they coldly laugh'd—and laid him there: <line>the flat and turfless earth above <line>the being we so much did love; <line>his empty chain above it leant, <line>such murder's fitting monument! <line> <line> but he, the favourite and the flower, <line>most cherish'd since his natal hour, <line>his mother's image in fair face <line>the infant love of all his race <line>his martyr'd father's dearest thought, <line>my latest care, for whom i sought <line>to hoard my life, that his might be <line>less wretched now, and one day free; <line>he, too, who yet had held untired <line>a spirit natural or inspired— <line>he, too, was struck, and day by day <line>was wither'd on the stalk away. <line>oh, god! it is a fearful thing <line>to see the human soul take wing <line>in any shape, in any mood: <line>i've seen it rushing forth in blood, <line>i've seen it on the breaking ocean <line>strive with a swoln convulsive motion, <line>i've seen the sick and ghastly bed <line>of sin delirious with its dread: <line>but these were horrors—this was woe <line>unmix'd with such—but sure and slow: <line>he faded, and so calm and meek, <line>so softly worn, so sweetly weak, <line>so tearless, yet so tender—kind, <line>and grieved for those he left behind; <line>with all the while a cheek whose bloom <line>was as a mockery of the tomb <line>whose tints as gently sunk away <line>as a departing rainbow's ray; <line>an eye of most transparent light, <line>that almost made the dungeon bright; <line>and not a word of murmur—not <line>a groan o'er his untimely lot,— <line>a little talk of better days, <line>a little hope my own to raise, <line>for i was sunk in silence—lost <line>in this last loss, of all the most; <line>and then the sighs he would suppress <line>of fainting nature's feebleness, <line>more slowly drawn, grew less and less: <line>i listen'd, but i could not hear; <line>i call'd, for i was wild with fear; <line>i knew 'twas hopeless, but my dread <line>would not be thus admonishèd; <line>i call'd, and thought i heard a sound— <line>i burst my chain with one strong bound, <line>and rushed to him:—i found him not, <line>i only stirred in this black spot, <line>i only lived, i only drew <line>the accursed breath of dungeon-dew; <line>the last, the sole, the dearest link <line>between me and the eternal brink, <line>which bound me to my failing race <line>was broken in this fatal place. <line>one on the earth, and one beneath— <line>my brothers—both had ceased to breathe: <line>i took that hand which lay so still, <line>alas! my own was full as chill; <line>i had not strength to stir, or strive, <line>but felt that i was still alive— <line>a frantic feeling, when we know <line>that what we love shall ne'er be so. <line> <line> i know not why <line> <line> i could not die, <line>i had no earthly hope—but faith, <line>and that forbade a selfish death. <line> <line> what next befell me then and there <line> <line> i know not well—i never knew— <line>first came the loss of light, and air, <line> <line> and then of darkness too: <line>i had no thought, no feeling—none— <line>among the stones i stood a stone, <line>and was, scarce conscious what i wist, <line>as shrubless crags within the mist; <line>for all was blank, and bleak, and grey; <line>it was not night—it was not day; <line>it was not even the dungeon-light, <line>so hateful to my heavy sight, <line>but vacancy absorbing space, <line>and fixedness—without a place; <line>there were no stars, no earth, no time, <line>no check, no change, no good, no crime <line>but silence, and a stirless breath <line>which neither was of life nor death; <line>a sea of stagnant idleness, <line>blind, boundless, mute, and motionless! <line>a light broke in upon my brain,— <line> <line> it was the carol of a bird; <line>it ceased, and then it came again, <line> <line> the sweetest song ear ever heard, <line>and mine was thankful till my eyes <line>ran over with the glad surprise, <line>and they that moment could not see <line>i was the mate of misery; <line>but then by dull degrees came back <line>my senses to their wonted track; <line>i saw the dungeon walls and floor <line>close slowly round me as before, <line>i saw the glimmer of the sun <line>creeping as it before had done, <line>but through the crevice where it came <line>that bird was perch'd, as fond and tame, <line> <line> and tamer than upon the tree; <line>a lovely bird, with azure wings, <line>and song that said a thousand things, <line> <line> and seemed to say them all for me! <line>i never saw its like before, <line>i ne'er shall see its likeness more: <line>it seem'd like me to want a mate, <line>but was not half so desolate, <line>and it was come to love me when <line>none lived to love me so again, <line>and cheering from my dungeon's brink, <line>had brought me back to feel and think. <line>i know not if it late were free, <line> <line> or broke its cage to perch on mine, <line>but knowing well captivity, <line> <line> sweet bird! i could not wish for thine! <line>or if it were, in wingèd guise, <line>a visitant from paradise; <line>for—heaven forgive that thought! the while <line>which made me both to weep and smile— <line>i sometimes deem'd that it might be <line>my brother's soul come down to me; <line>but then at last away it flew, <line>and then 'twas mortal well i knew, <line>for he would never thus have flown— <line>and left me twice so doubly lone,— <line>lone as the corse within its shroud, <line>lone as a solitary cloud, <line> <line> a single cloud on a sunny day, <line>while all the rest of heaven is clear, <line>a frown upon the atmosphere, <line>that hath no business to appear <line> <line> when skies are blue, and earth is gay. <line> <line> a kind of change came in my fate, <line>my keepers grew compassionate; <line>i know not what had made them so, <line>they were inured to sights of woe, <line>but so it was:—my broken chain <line>with links unfasten'd did remain, <line>and it was liberty to stride <line>along my cell from side to side, <line>and up and down, and then athwart, <line>and tread it over every part; <line>and round the pillars one by one, <line>returning where my walk begun, <line>avoiding only, as i trod, <line>my brothers' graves without a sod; <line>for if i thought with heedless tread <line>my step profaned their lowly bed, <line>my breath came gaspingly and thick, <line>and my crush'd heart felt blind and sick. <line>i made a footing in the wall, <line> <line> it was not therefrom to escape, <line>for i had buried one and all, <line> <line> who loved me in a human shape; <line>and the whole earth would henceforth be <line>a wider prison unto me: <line>no child, no sire, no kin had i, <line>no partner in my misery; <line>i thought of this, and i was glad, <line>for thought of them had made me mad; <line>but i was curious to ascend <line>to my barr'd windows, and to bend <line>once more, upon the mountains high, <line>the quiet of a loving eye. <line> <line> i saw them—and they were the same, <line>they were not changed like me in frame; <line>i saw their thousand years of snow <line>on high—their wide long lake below, <line>and the blue rhone in fullest flow; <line>i heard the torrents leap and gush <line>o'er channell'd rock and broken bush; <line>i saw the white-wall'd distant town, <line>and whiter sails go skimming down; <line>and then there was a little isle, <line>which in my very face did smile, <line> <line> the only one in view; <line>a small green isle, it seem'd no more, <line>scarce broader than my dungeon floor, <line>but in it there were three tall trees, <line>and o'er it blew the mountain breeze, <line>and by it there were waters flowing, <line>and on it there were young flowers growing, <line> <line> of gentle breath and hue. <line>the fish swam by the castle wall, <line>and they seem'd joyous each and all; <line>the eagle rode the rising blast, <line>methought he never flew so fast <line>as then to me he seem'd to fly; <line>and then new tears came in my eye, <line>and i felt troubled—and would fain <line>i had not left my recent chain; <line>and when i did descend again, <line>the darkness of my dim abode <line>fell on me as a heavy load; <line>it was as is a new-dug grave, <line>closing o'er one we sought to save,— <line>and yet my glance, too much opprest, <line>had almost need of such a rest. <line> <line> it might be months, or years, or days— <line> <line> i kept no count, i took no note— <line>i had no hope my eyes to raise, <line> <line> and clear them of their dreary mote; <line>at last men came to set me free; <line> <line> i ask'd not why, and reck'd not where; <line>it was at length the same to me, <line>fetter'd or fetterless to be, <line> <line> i learn'd to love despair. <line>and thus when they appear'd at last, <line>and all my bonds aside were cast, <line>these heavy walls to me had grown <line>a hermitage—and all my own! <line>and half i felt as they were come <line>to tear me from a second home: <line>with spiders i had friendship made <line>and watch'd them in their sullen trade, <line>had seen the mice by moonlight play, <line>and why should i feel less than they? <line>we were all inmates of one place, <line>and i, the monarch of each race, <line>had power to kill—yet, strange to tell! <line>in quiet we had learn'd to dwell; <line>my very chains and i grew friends, <line>so much a long communion tends <line>to make us what we are:—even i <line>regain'd my freedom with a sigh. <line> <line>","living,death,growing old,sorrow & grieving,relationships,family & ancestors,nature,animals,landscapes & pastorals,social commentaries,crime & punishment"

at what he had done to achille, <line> <line>his brother. but his arc was over, for the course <line> <line>of every comet is such. the fated crescent <line> <line>was printed on the road by the scorching tires. <line> <line>a salt tear ran down the porcelain cheek and it went <line> <line>in one slow drop to the clenched knuckle that still gripped <line> <line>the wheel. on the flecked sea, the uninterrupted <line> <line>wind herded the long african combers, and whipped <line> <line>the small flag of the island on its silver spearhead.ii <line> <line>drivers leant over the rail. one seized my luggage <line> <line>off the porter’s cart. the rest burst into patois, <line> <line>with gestures of despair at the lost privilege <line> <line>of driving me, then turned to other customers. <line> <line>in the evening pastures horses grazed, their hides wet <line> <line>with light that shot its lances over the combers. <line> <line>i had the transport all to myself. <line> <line> “you all set? <line> <line>good. a good pal of mine died in that chariot <line> <line>of his called the comet.” <line> <line> he turned in the front seat, <line> <line>spinning the air with his free hand. i sat, sprawled out <line> <line>in the back, discouraging talk, with my crossed feet. <line> <line>“you never know when, eh? i was at the airport <line> <line>that day. i see him take off like a rocket. <line> <line>i always said that thing have too much horsepower. <line> <line>and so said, so done. the same hotel, chief, correct?” <line> <line>i saw the coastal villages receding as <line> <line>the highway’s tongue translated bush into forest, <line> <line>the wild savannah into moderate pastures, <line> <line>that other life going in its “change for the best,” <line> <line>its peace paralyzed in a postcard, a concrete <line> <line>future ahead of it all, in the cinder-blocks <line> <line>of hotel development with the obsolete <line> <line>craft of the carpenter, as i sensed, in the neat <line> <line>marinas, the fisherman’s phantom. old oarlocks <line> <line>and rusting fretsaw. my craft required the same <line> <line>crouching care, the same crabbed, natural devotion <line> <line>of the hand that stencilled a flowered window-frame <line> <line>or planed an elegant canoe; its time was gone <line> <line>with the spirit in the wood, as wood grew obsolete <line> <line>and plasterers smoothed the blank page of white concrete. <line> <line>i watched the afternoon sea. didn’t i want the poor <line> <line>to stay in the same light so that i could transfix <line> <line>them in amber, the afterglow of an empire, <line> <line>preferring a shed of palm-thatch with tilted sticks <line> <line>to that blue bus-stop? didn’t i prefer a road <line> <line>from which tracks climbed into the thickening syntax <line> <line>of colonial travellers, the measured prose i read <line> <line>as a schoolboy? that cove, with its brown shallows <line> <line>there, praslin? that heron? had they waited for me <line> <line>to develop my craft? why hallow that pretence <line> <line>of preserving what they left, the hypocrisy <line> <line>of loving them from hotels, a biscuit-tin fence <line> <line>smothered in love-vines, scenes to which i was attached <line> <line>as blindly as plunkett with his remorseful research? <line> <line>art is history’s nostalgia, it prefers a thatched <line> <line>roof to a concrete factory, and the huge church <line> <line>above a bleached village. the gap between the driver <line> <line>and me increased when he said: <line> <line> “the place changing, eh?” <line> <line>where an old rumshop had gone, but not that river <line> <line>with its clogged shadows. that would make me a stranger. <line> <line>“all to the good,” he said. i said, “all to the good,” <line> <line>then, “whoever they are,” to myself. i caught his eyes <line> <line>in the mirror. we were climbing out of micoud. <line> <line>hadn’t i made their poverty my paradise? <line> <line>his back could have been hector’s, ferrying tourists <line> <line>in the other direction home, the leopard seat <line> <line>scratching their damp backs like the fur-covered armrests. <line> <line>he had driven his burnt-out cargo, tired of sweat, <line> <line>who longed for snow on the moon and didn’t have to face <line> <line>the heat of that sinking sun, who knew a climate <line> <line>as monotonous as this one could only produce <line> <line>from its unvarying vegetation flashes <line> <line>of a primal insight like those red-pronged lilies <line> <line>that shot from the verge, that their dried calabashes <line> <line>of fake african masks for a fake achilles <line> <line>rattled with the seeds that came from other men’s minds. <line> <line>so let them think that. who needed art in this place <line> <line>where even the old women strode with stiff-backed spines, <line> <line>and the fishermen had such adept thumbs, such grace <line> <line>these people had, but what they envied most in them <line> <line>was the calypso part, the caribbean lilt <line> <line>still in the shells of their ears, like the surf’s rhythm, <line> <line>until too much happiness was shadowed with guilt <line> <line>like any eden, and they sighed at the sign: hewannorra (iounalao), the gold sea <line> <line>flat as a credit-card, extending its line <line> <line>to a beach that now looked just like everywhere else, <line> <line>greece or hawaii. now the goddamn souvenir <line> <line>felt absurd, excessive. the painted gourds, the shells. <line> <line>their own faces as brown as gourds. mine felt as strange <line> <line>as those at the counter feeling their bodies change.iii <line> <line>change lay in our silence. we had come to that bend <line> <line>where the trees are warped by wind, and the cliffs, raw, <line> <line>shelve surely to foam. <line> <line> “is right here everything end,” <line> <line>the driver said, and rammed open the transport door <line> <line>on his side, then mine. <line> <line> “anyway, chief, the view nice.” <line> <line>i joined him at the gusting edge. <line> <line> “his name was hector.” <line> <line>the name was bent like the trees on the precipice <line> <line>to point inland. in its echo a man-o’-war <line> <line>screamed on the wind. the driver moved off for a piss, <line> <line>then shouted over his shoulder: <line> <line> “a road-warrior. <line> <line>he would drive like a madman when the power took. <line> <line>he had a nice woman. maybe he died for her.” <line> <line>for her and tourism, i thought. the driver shook <line> <line>himself, zipping then hoisting his crotch. <line> <line> “crazy, but <line> <line>a gentle fellow anyway, with a very good brain.” <line> <line>cut to a leopard galloping on a dry plain <line> <line>across serengeti. cut to the spraying fans <line> <line>drummed by a riderless stallion, its wild mane <line> <line>scaring the scamander. cut to a woman’s hands <line> <line>clenched towards her mouth with no sound. cut to the wheel <line> <line>of a chariot’s spiked hubcap. cut to the face <line> <line>of his muscling jaw, then flashback to achille <line> <line>hurling a red tin and a cutlass. next, a vase <line> <line>with a girl’s hoarse whisper echoing “omeros,” <line> <line>as in a conch-shell. cut to a shield of silver <line> <line>rolling like a hubcap. rewind, in slow motion, <line> <line>myrmidons gathering by a village river <line> <line>with lances for oars. cut to the surpliced ocean <line> <line>droning its missal. cut. a crane hoisting a wreck. <line> <line>a horse nosing the surf, then shuddering its neck. <line> <line>he’d paid the penalty of giving up the sea <line> <line>as graceless and as treacherous as it had seemed, <line> <line>for the taxi-business; he was making money, <line> <line>but all of that money was making him ashamed <line> <line>of the long afternoons of shouting by the wharf <line> <line>hustling passengers. he missed the uncertain sand <line> <line>under his feet, he sighed for the trough of a wave, <line> <line>and the jerk of the oar when it turned in his hand, <line> <line>and the rose conch sunset with its low pelicans. <line> <line>castries was corrupting him with its roaring life, <line> <line>its littered market, with too many transport vans <line> <line>competing. castries had been his common-law wife <line> <line>who, like helen, he had longed for from a distance, <line> <line>and now he had both, but a frightening discontent <line> <line>hollowed his face; to find that the sea was a love <line> <line>he could never lose made every gesture violent: <line> <line>ramming the side-door shut, raking the clutch. he drove <line> <line>as if driven by furies, but furies paid the rent. <line> <line>a man who cursed the sea had cursed his own mother. mer was both mother and sea. in his lost canoe <line> <line>he had said his prayers. but now he was in another <line> <line>kind of life that was changing him with his brand-new <line> <line>stereo, its endless garages, where he could not <line> <line>whip off his shirt, hearing the conch’s summoning note.chapter xlvii <line> <line>hector was buried near the sea he had loved once. <line> <line>not too far from the shallows where he fought achille <line> <line>for a tin and helen. he did not hear the sea-almond’s <line> <line>moan over the bay when philoctete blew the shell, <line> <line>nor the one drumbeat of a wave-thud, nor a sail <line> <line>rattling to rest as its day’s work was over, <line> <line>and its mate, gauging depth, bent over the gunwale, <line> <line>then wearily sounding the fathoms with an oar, <line> <line>the same rite his shipmates would repeat soon enough <line> <line>when it was their turn to lie quiet as hector, <line> <line>lowering a pitch-pine canoe in the earth’s trough, <line> <line>to sleep under the piled conchs, through every weather <line> <line>on the violet-wreathed mound. crouching for his friend to hear, <line> <line>achille whispered about their ancestral river, <line> <line>and those things he would recognize when he got there, <line> <line>his true home, forever and ever and ever, <line> <line>forever, compère. then philoctete limped over <line> <line>and rested his hand firmly on a shaking shoulder <line> <line>to anchor his sorrow. seven seas and helen <line> <line>did not come nearer. achille had carried an oar <line> <line>to the church and propped it outside with the red tin. <line> <line>now his voice strengthened. he said: “mate, this is your spear,” <line> <line>and laid the oar slowly, the same way he had placed <line> <line>the parallel oars in the hull of the gommier <line> <line>the day the african swift and its shadow raced. <line> <line>and this was the prayer that achille could not utter: <line> <line>“the spear that i give you, my friend, is only wood. <line> <line>vexation is past. i know how well you treat her. <line> <line>you never know my admiration, when you stood <line> <line>crossing the sun at the bow of the long canoe <line> <line>with the plates of your chest like a shield; i would say <line> <line>any enemy so was a compliment. ’cause no <line> <line>african ever hurled his wide seine at the bay <line> <line>by which he was born with such beauty. you hear me? men <line> <line>did not know you like me. all right. sleep good. good night.” <line> <line>achille moved philoctete’s hand, then he saw helen <line> <line>standing alone and veiled in the widowing light. <line> <line>then he reached down to the grave and lifted the tin <line> <line>to her. helen nodded. a wind blew out the sun.ii <line> <line>pride set in helen’s face after this, like a stone <line> <line>bracketed with hector’s name; her lips were incised <line> <line>by its dates in parenthesis. she seemed more stern, <line> <line>more ennobled by distance as she slowly crossed <line> <line>the hot street of the village like a distant sail <line> <line>on the horizon. grief heightened her. when she smiled <line> <line>it was with such distance that it was hard to tell <line> <line>if she had heard your condolence. it was the child, <line> <line>ma kilman told them, that made her more beautiful.iii <line> <line>the rites of the island were simplified by its elements, <line> <line>which changed places. the grooved sea was achille’s garden, <line> <line>the ridged plot of rattling plantains carried their sense <line> <line>of the sea, and philoctete, on his height, often heard, in <line> <line>a wind that suddenly churned the rage of deep gorges, <line> <line>the leafy sound of far breakers plunging with smoke, <line> <line>and for smoke there were the bonfires which the sun catches <line> <line>on the blue heights at sunrise, doing the same work <line> <line>as philoctete clearing his plot, just as, at sunset, <line> <line>smoke came from the glowing rim of the horizon as if <line> <line>from his enamel pot. the woodsmoke smelt of a regret <line> <line>that men cannot name. on the charred field, the massive <line> <line>sawn trunks burnt slowly like towers, and the great <line> <line>indigo dusk slowly plumed down, devouring the still leaves, <line> <line>igniting the firefly huts, lifting the panicky egret <line> <line>to beat its lagoon and shelve in the cage of the mangroves, <line> <line>take in the spars of its sails, then with quick-pricking head <line> <line>anchor itself shiftingly, and lift its question again. <line> <line>at night, the island reversed its elements, the heron <line> <line>of a quarter-moon floated from hector’s grave, rain <line> <line>rose upwards from the sea, and the corrugated iron <line> <line>of the sea glittered with nailheads. ragged <line> <line>plantains bent and stepped with their rustling powers <line> <line>over the furrows of philoctete’s garden, a chorus of aged <line> <line>ancestors and straw, and, rustling, surrounded every house <line> <line>in the village with its back garden, with its rank midden <line> <line>of rusted chamber pots, rotting nets, and the moon’s cold basin. <line> <line>they sounded, when they shook, after the moonlit meridian <line> <line>of their crossing, like the night-surf; they gazed in <line> <line>silence at the shadows of their lamplit children. <line> <line>at philoctete, groaning and soaking the flower on his shin <line> <line>with hot sulphur, cleaning its edges with yellow vaseline, <line> <line>and, gripping his knee, squeezing rags from the basin. <line> <line>at night, when yards are asleep, and the broken line <line> <line>of the surf hisses like philo, “bon dieu, aie, waie, my sin <line> <line>is this sore?” the old plantains suffer and shine.chapter xlviii <line> <line>islands of bay leaves in the medicinal bath <line> <line>of a cauldron, a sibylline cure. the citron <line> <line>sprig of a lime-tree dividing the sky in half <line> <line>dipped its divining rod. the white spray of the thorn, <line> <line>which the swift bends lightly, waited for a black hand <line> <line>to break it in bits and boil its leaves for the wound <line> <line>from the pronged anchor rusting in clean bottom-sand. <line> <line>ma kilman, in a black hat with its berried fringe, <line> <line>eased herself sideways down the broken concrete step <line> <line>of the rumshop’s back door, closed it, and rammed the hinge <line> <line>tight. the bolt caught a finger and with that her instep <line> <line>arch twisted and she let out a soft catholic <line> <line>curse, then crossed herself. she closed the gate. the asphalt <line> <line>sweated with the heat, the limp breadfruit leaves were thick <line> <line>over the fence. her spectacles swam in their sweat. <line> <line>she plucked an armpit. the damn wig was badly made. <line> <line>she was going to five o’clock mass, to la messe, <line> <line>and sometimes she had to straighten it as she prayed <line> <line>until the wafer dissolved her with tenderness, <line> <line>the way a raindrop melts on the tongue of a breeze. <line> <line>in the church’s cool cave the sweat dried from her eyes. <line> <line>she rolled down the elastic bands below the knees <line> <line>of her swollen stockings. it was then that their vise <line> <line>round her calves reminded her of philoctete. then, <line> <line>numbering her beads, she began her own litany <line> <line>of berries, hail mary marigolds that stiffen <line> <line>their aureoles in the heights, mild anemone <line> <line>and clear watercress, the sacred heart of jesus <line> <line>pierced like the anthurium, the thorns of logwood, <line> <line>called the tree of life, the aloe good for seizures, <line> <line>the hole in the daisy’s palm, with its drying blood <line> <line>that was the hole in the fisherman’s shin since he was <line> <line>pierced by a hook; there was the pale, roadside tisane <line> <line>of her malarial childhood. there was this one <line> <line>for easing a birth-breach, that one for a love-bath, <line> <line>before the buds of green sugar-apples in the sun <line> <line>ripened like her nipples in girlhood. but what path <line> <line>led through nettles to the cure, the furious sibyl <line> <line>couldn’t remember. mimosa winced from her fingers, <line> <line>shutting like jalousies at some passing evil <line> <line>when she reached for them. the smell of incense lingers <line> <line>in her clothes. inside, the candle-flames are erect <line> <line>round the bier of the altar while she and her friends <line> <line>old-talk on the steps, but the plant keeps its secret <line> <line>when her memory reaches, shuttering in its fronds.ii <line> <line>the dew had not yet dried on the white-ribbed awnings <line> <line>and the nodding palanquins of umbrella yams <line> <line>where the dark grove had not heat but early mornings <line> <line>of perpetual freshness, in which the bearded arms <line> <line>of a cedar held council. between its gnarled toes <line> <line>grew the reek of an unknown weed; its pronged flower <line> <line>sprang like a buried anchor; its windborne odours <line> <line>diverted the bee from its pollen, but its power, <line> <line>rooted in bitterness, drew her bowed head by the nose <line> <line>as a spike does a circling bull. to approach it <line> <line>ma kilman lowered her head to one side and screened <line> <line>the stench with a cologned handkerchief. the mulch it <line> <line>was rooted in carried the smell, when it gangrened, <line> <line>of philoctete’s cut. in her black dress, her berried <line> <line>black hat, she climbed a goat-path up from the village, <line> <line>past the stones with dried palms and conchs, where the buried <line> <line>suffer the sun all day sunday, while goats forage <line> <line>the new wreaths. once more she pulled at the itch in her <line> <line>armpits, nearly dropping her purse. then she climbed hard <line> <line>up the rain-cracked path, the bay closing behind her <line> <line>like a wound, and rested. everything that echoed <line> <line>repeated its outline: a goat’s doddering bleat, <line> <line>a hammer multiplying a roof, and, through the back yards, <line> <line>a mother cursing a boy too nimble to beat. <line> <line>ma kilman picked up her purse and sighed on upwards <line> <line>to the thread of the smell, one arm behind her back, <line> <line>passing the cactus, the thorn trees, and then the wood <line> <line>appeared over her, thick green, the green almost black <line> <line>as her dress in its shade, its border of flowers <line> <line>flecking the pasture with spray. then she staggered back <line> <line>from the line of ants at her feet. she saw the course <line> <line>they had kept behind her, following her from church, <line> <line>signalling a language she could not recognize.iii <line> <line>a swift had carried the strong seed in its stomach <line> <line>centuries ago from its antipodal shore, <line> <line>skimming the sea-troughs, outdarting ospreys, her luck <line> <line>held to its shadow. she aimed to carry the cure <line> <line>that precedes every wound; the reversible bight <line> <line>of benin was her bow, her target the ringed haze <line> <line>of a circling horizon. the star-grains at night <line> <line>made her hungrier; the leafless sea with no house <line> <line>for her weariness. sometimes she dozed in her flight <line> <line>for a swift’s second, closing the seeds of her stare, <line> <line>then ruddering straight. the dry sea-flakes whitened her <line> <line>breast, her feathers thinned. then, one dawn the day-star <line> <line>rose slowly from the wrong place and it frightened her <line> <line>because all the breakers were blowing from the wrong <line> <line>east. she saw the horned island and uncurled her claws <line> <line>with one frail cry, since swifts are not given to song, <line> <line>and fluttered down to a beach, ejecting the seed <line> <line>in grass near the sand. she nestled in dry seaweed. <line> <line>in a year she was bleached bone. all of that motion <line> <line>a pile of fragile ash from the fire of her will, <line> <line>but the vine grew its own wings, out of the ocean <line> <line>it climbed like the ants, the ancestors of achille, <line> <line>the women carrying coals after the dark door <line> <line>slid over the hold. as the weed grew in odour <line> <line>so did its strength at the damp root of the cedar, <line> <line>where the flower was anchored at the mottled root <line> <line>as a lizard crawled upwards, foot by sallow foot. <line>","activities,travels & journeys,relationships,men &

12234,9961,"<line> <line>there are who separate the eternal light in forms of man and woman, day and night; they cannot bear that god be essence quite. existence is as deep a verity: without the dual, where is unity? and the ‘i am’ cannot forbear to be; but from its primal nature forced to frame mysteries, destinies of various name, is forced to give what it has taught to claim. thus love must answer to its own unrest; the bad commands us to expect the best, and hope of its own prospects is the test. and dost thou seek to find the one in two? only upon the old can build the new; the symbol which you seek is found in you. the heart and mind, the wisdom and the will, the man and woman, must be severed still, and christ must reconcile the good and ill. there are to whom each symbol is a mask; the life of love is a mysterious task; they want no answer, for they would not ask. a single thought transfuses every form; the sunny day is changed into the storm, for light is dark, hard soft, and cold is warm. one presence fills and floods the whole serene; nothing can be, nothing has ever been, except the one truth that creates the scene. does the heart beat, — that is a seeming only; you cannot be alone, though you are lonely; the all is neutralized in the one only. you ask a faith, — they are content with faith; you ask to have, — but they reply, ‘it hath.’ there is no end, and there need be no path. the day wears heavily, — why, then, ignore it; peace is the soul’s desire, — such thoughts restore it; the truth thou art, — it needs not to implore it. the presence all thy fancies supersedes, all that is done which thou wouldst seek in deeds, the wealth obliterates all seeming needs. both these are true, and if they are at strife, the mystery bears the one name of life, that, slowly spelled, will yet compose the strife. the men of old say, ‘live twelve thousand years, and see the need of all that here appears, and moxen* shall absorb thy smiles and tears.’ these later men say, ‘live this little day. believe that human nature is the way, and know both son and father while you pray; and one in two, in three, and none alone, letting you know even as you are known, shall make the you and me eternal parts of one.’ to me, our destinies seem flower and fruit born of an ever-generating root; the other statement i cannot dispute. but say that love and life eternal seem, and if eternal ties be but a dream, what is the meaning of that self-same seem? your nature craves eternity for truth; eternity of love is prayer of youth; how, without love, would have gone forth your truth? i do not think we are deceived to grow, but that the crudest fancy, slightest show, covers some separate truth that we may know. in the one truth, each separate fact is true; eternally in one i many view, and destinies through destiny pursue. this is my tendency; but can i say that this my thought leads the true, only way? i only know it constant leads, and i obey. i only know one prayer — ‘give me the truth, give me that colored whiteness, ancient youth, complex and simple, seen in joy and truth. let me not by vain wishes bar my claim, nor soothe my hunger by an empty name, nor crucify the son of man by hasty blame. but in the earth and fire, water and air, live earnestly by turns without despair, nor seek a home till home be every where!’ <line>","religion,god & the divine"

our mothers. all that talking!—poems and paintings,parents, all those parties, and the age of manifestos still to come!i started coming to new york for lunch. we’d meet at art news,walk to fifty-sixth street to larre’s, a restaurant filled with french expatriates,have martinis and the prix fixe for $2.50 (!), drink rose de provenceand talk (of course) about genet and james and words like “coca-cola.”it was an afternoon in may when john brought up a playthat he and kenneth koch and frank o’hara—holy trinity!(batman was in vogue)—had started years ago and never finished.there was a dictator named edgar and some penicillin,but that’s all i remember. they hadn’t actually been togetherin years, but planned to finish it that night at john’s new apartmenton ninety-fifth street, and he said to come by for a drinkbefore they ate and got to work. it was a new york dreamcome true: a brownstone floor-through, white and full of paintings(naturally), “with a good library and record collection.”john had procured a huge steak, and as i helped him set the tablethe doorbell rang and frank o’hara, fresh from the museumand svelte in a hound’s tooth sports coat entered, followed shortlyby “excitement-prone kenneth koch” in somber gray,and i was one with my immortals. in the small mythologieswe make up out of memories and the flow of timea few moments remain frozen, though the feel of them is lost,the feel of talk. it ranged from puns to gossip, always coming back to poems and poets. frank was fiercely loyal to young poets(joe ceravolo’s name came up i think), and when i mentioned lewisin a way that must have sounded catty, he leapt to his defense,leaving me to backtrack in embarrassment and have another drink,which is what everyone had. i think you see where it was going:conversation drifting into dinner, then i stayed for dinnerand everyone forgot about the play, which was never finished(though i think i’ve seen a fragment of it somewhere). i see a tablein a cone of light, but there’s no sound except for kenneth’s deadpan “love to see a boy eat” as i speared a piece of steak;and then the only voice i’m sure i hear is mine,as those moments that had once seemed singular and cleardissolve into a “general mess of imprecision of feeling”and images, augmented by line breaks. there were phone calls,other people arrived, the narrative of the night dissolvedand finally everyone went home. school and spring wound down.the semester ended, then the weekend that i wrote about in “sally’s hair”arrived and went, and then a late-night cruise around manhattan for a rich friend’sparents’ anniversary bash, followed by an upper east side preppie barthat left me looking for a place to crash, and so i rang john’s bell at 2 amand failed (thank god) to rouse him, caught a plane to san diegothe next day, worked at my summer job and worked on poemsand started reading proust, and got a card one afternoonfrom peter schjeldahl telling me that frank o’hara had been killed.ninety-fifth street soldiered on for several years.i remember a cocktail party (the symposium of those days),followed by dinner just around the corner at elaine’s,pre-woody allen. it was there i learned of r.f.k.’s assassinationwhen i woke up on the daybed in the living room, and wherejohn told me getting married would ruin me as a poet(i don’t know why—most of his friends were married), a judgmenthe revised when he met susan and inscribed the double dream of spring“if this is all we need fear from spinach, then i don’t mind so much”(which was probably premature—watering his plants one dayshe soaked his landlord, giorgio cavallon, dozing in the garden below).it was where peter delacorte late one night recited an entire sideof a firesign theatre album from memory, and set john on that path,to his friends’ subsequent dismay, and where he blessed me with his extra copyof the poems, and next day had second thoughts (though i kept it anyway). sometimes a vague, amorphous stretch of years assumes a shape,and then becomes an age, and then a golden age alive with possibilities,when change was in the air and you could wander through its streetsas though through florence and the renaissance. i know it sounds ridiculous,but that’s the way life flows: in stages that take form in retrospect,when all the momentary things that occupy the mind from day to dayhave vanished into time, and something takes their place that wasn’t there,a sense of freedom—one which gradually slipped away. the centerof the conversation moved downtown, the renaissance gave way to mannerismas the junior faculty took charge, leaving the emeriti alone and out of itof course, lying on the fringes, happily awake; but for the rest the laws proscribing what you couldn’t do were clear. i got so tiredof writing all those new york poems (though by then i’d moved to boston—to siena, you might say) that led to nowhere but the next one,so i started writing poems about whatever moved me: what it’s liketo be alive within a world that holds no place for you, yet seems so beautiful;the feeling of the future, and its disappointments; the trajectory of a life,that always brought me back to time and memory (i’d finished proust by then),and brings me back to this. john finally moved downtown himself,into a two-story apartment at twenty-fifth and tenth, with a spiral staircase leading to a library, the locus of the incident of susan, alydar and john and the pitcher of water (i’ll draw a veil over it), and jimmy schuyler sighing“it’s so beautiful,” as bernadette peters sang “raining in my heart” from dames at sea.the poetry still continued—mine and everyone’s. i’d added jimmy to my pantheon (as you’ve probably noticed), but the night in nineteen sixty-six seemed more and more remote: i never saw kenneth anymore,and there were new epicenters, with new casts of characters, like madoo, bob dash’s garden in sagaponack, and bill and willy’s loft in soho.john moved again, to twenty-second street, and susan and i moved to milwaukee,where our son was born. i stopped coming to new york, and writing poems, for several years, while i tried to dream enough philosophy for tenure.one afternoon in may i found myself at ninth and twenty-second,and as though on cue two people whom i hadn’t seen in years—david kalstone, darragh park—just happened by, and then i took a taxi down to sohoto the loft, and then a gallery to hear joe brainard read from i remember,back to john’s and out to dinner—as though i’d never been away, though it was all too clear i had. poems were in the air, but theory too, and members of the thought police department (who must have also gotten tenure) turned up everywhere, with arguments that poetry was called upon to prove.it mattered, but in a different way, as though it floated free from poemsand wasn’t quite the point. i kept on coming back, as i still do.half my life was still to come, and yet the rest was mostly personal:i got divorced, and willy killed himself, and here i am now, ready to retire.there was an obituary in the times last week for michael goldberg,a painter you’ll recall from frank o’hara’s poems (“why i am not a painter,”“ode to michael goldberg (’s birth and other births)”). i didn’t know him,but a few months after the soiree on ninety-fifth street i was at a partyin his studio on the bowery, which was still his studio when he died.the new york art world demimonde was there, including nearly everyonewho’s turned up in this poem. i remember staring at a guy wholooked like something from the black lagoon, dancing with a gorgeouswoman half his age. that’s my new york: an island dreamof personalities and evenings, nights where poetry was second natureand their lives flowed through it and around it as it gave them life.o brave new world (now old) that had such people in’t! <line> <line>* * * <line> <line>“the tiresome old man is telling us his life story.” i guess i am, but that’s what poets do—not always quite as obviously as this, and usually more by indirectionand omission, but beneath the poetry lies the singular reality and unreality of an individual life. i see it as a long,illuminated tunnel, lined with windows giving on the scenes outside—on ninety-fifth street forty years ago. as life goes onyou start to get increasingly distracted by your own reflectionand the darkness gradually becoming visible at the end. i try not to look too far ahead, but just to stay here— quick now, here, now, always—only something pulls meback (as they say) to the day, when poems were more like secrets,with their own vernacular, and you could tell your friends by who and what they read. and now john’s practically become a national treasure, and whenever i look up i think i see him floating in the sky like the cheshire cat. i don’t knowwhat to make of it, but it makes me happy—like seeing kenneth just before he died (“i’m going west john, i’m going west”) in his apartment on a side street near columbia, or rememberingonce again that warm spring night in nineteen sixty-six. i like to think of them together once again, at the cocktail partyat the end of the mind, where i could blunder in and ruin it one last time.meanwhile, on a hillside in the driftless region to the west,a few miles from the small town where the straight story ends,i’m building a house on a meadow, if i’m permitted to return,behind a screen of trees above a lower meadow, with some apple treesin which the fog collects on autumn afternoons, and a vistaof an upland pasture without heaviness. i see myselfsitting on the deck and sipping a martini, as i used to at larre’s, in a future that feels almost like a past i’m positive is there— but where? i think my life is still all conversation,only now it’s with myself. i can see it continuing forever,even in my absence, as i close the windows and turn off the lightsand it begins to rain. and then we’re there together in the house on the meadow, waiting for whatever’s left to comein what’s become the near future—two versions of myself and of the people that we knew, each one an otherto the other, yet both indelibly there: the twit of twentyand the aging child of sixty-two, still separateand searching in the night, listening through the nightto the noise of the rain and memories of rainand evenings when we’d wander out into the renaissance,when i could see you and talk to you and it could still change;and still there in the morning when the rain has stopped,and the apples are all getting tinted in the cool light.

12293,11435,"<line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>act 2, scene 2clindor, a young picaresque hero, has been living by his wits in paris, but has now drifted to bordeaux, to become the valet of a braggart bravo named matamore. he is chiefly employed as a go-between, carrying matamore's amorous messages to the beautiful isabelle—who only suffers the master because she is in love with the messenger. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>clindor sir, why so restless? is there any need, with all your fame, for one more glorious deed? have you not slain enough bold foes by now, and must you have fresh laurels for your brow? matamore it's true, i'm restless, and i can't decide which of two foes should first be nullified— the mogul emperor or the persian sophy. clindor ah, let them live a while, sir. neither trophy would add a great deal to your fame and standing. and where's the army that you'd be commanding? matamore army? ah, villain, coward, do you doubt that with this arm alone i'd wipe them out? the mere sound of my name makes ramparts yield, and drives divisions from the battlefield; my wrath against these rulers needs engage only a piddling portion of my rage; with one commandment given to the fates i oust the strongest monarchs from their states; thunder's my cannon; my troops, the destinies; one blow lays low a thousand enemies; one breath, and all their hopes go up in smoke. yet you dare speak of armies! what a joke! no longer shall a second mars employ you; with but a glance, you rogue, i shall destroy you ... and yet the thought of her whom i adore softens me now, and i'm enraged no more; that little archer, whom every god obeys, forbids my eyes to glare with lethal rays. observe how my ferocity, which hates and hacks and slaughters, gently dissipates when i recall my lady, and my face is changed by thoughts of beauty, love, and grace. clindor oh, sir, you have a hundred selves or more; you're as handsome now as you were grim before. i can't imagine any lady who could stubbornly refuse her heart to you. matamore whatever i may have said, feel no alarm: sometimes i terrify, sometimes i charm; depending on my humor, i inspire men with anxiety, women with desire. before i had the power to suppress my beauty, women gave me much distress: when i appeared, they swooned in quantity, and thousands died each day for love of me. with every princess i had many a tryst, and every queen came begging to be kissed; the ethiopian and the japanese murmured my name in all their sighs and pleas. two sultanesses could not but adore me, two more escaped from the seraglio fòr me, which strained my friendship with the turkish nation. clindor their anger could but gild your reputation. matamore still, all that was more trouble than it was worth. it balked my plans for conquering the earth. what's more, i tired of it, and to deter such nuisances sent word to jupiter that if he could not put a stop to these fond women and their importunities, i'd rise up in a rage and end his reign as ruler of the gods, and would obtain for mars the right to throw his bolts of thunder. needless to say, the coward knuckled under: he did as i desired, and now, you see, i'm handsome only when i choose to be. clindor what love notes you'd receive, were that not so! matamore don't bring me any ... unless from her, you know. what does she say of me? clindor today she said that you inspire all hearts with love and dread, and that if what you promise her comes true, she'll feel herself a goddess, thanks to you. matamore back in the times i've just been speaking of, goddesses, also, pestered me for love, and i shall tell you of a strange event which caused confusion without precedent and threw all nature into disarray. the sun was powerless to rise one day because that bright, much-worshipped deity could not find where the dawn, his guide, might be. he sought her everywhere, in cephalus' bower, in old tithonus' bed, in memnon's tower, but since aurora nowhere was in sight, the day, till noontide, was as black as night. clindor where was the goddess, during these alarms? matamore in my bedchamber, offering me her charms. but she gained nothing by such shameless actions; my heart was blind to all her bright attractions, and all she got by showing off her beauty was a firm command to go and do her duty. clindor that curious story, sir, i now recall. i was in mexico, where i heard it all. they said that persia, vexed by the insult to their famous sun god, had it in for you. matamore i heard as much, and would have made them pay, but was in transylvania that day, where their ambassador hastened to appease my wrath with presents and apologies. clindor your brave heart showed them clemency. how fine! matamore just look, my friend, upon this face of mine. there every human virtue can be found. of all the foes i've stamped into the ground, whose kingdoms are annulled and cast aside, there was not one who did not fall through pride. but those who humbly honored my perfection have kept their power through a wise subjection. the modest kings of europe are all my vassals; i do not sack their towns or wreck their castles; i let them reign. but it's another story in africa, where i scorched the territory of certain kings who lacked humility, and left great deserts there for all to see. those endless sands, beneath those skies of fire, are a great monument to my righteous ire. clindor let us revert to love; your lady's here. matamore my cursèd rival's at her side, i fear. clindor where are you going? matamore he isn't brave, this dunce, and yet he's vain, and could be bold for once. perhaps he'll challenge me from foolish pride, merely because he's at the lady's side. clindor by doing so, the fool might come to harm. matamore i can't be valorous when i'm full of charm. clindor cease to be charming and be terrible, sir. matamore oh, you don't realize what that would incur. i can't be terrible by halves, you know; i'd slaughter both my mistress and my foe. until they part, let's stand aside and wait. clindor your prudence, like your valor, is very great.

12437,7355,"<line> <line>of mans first disobedience, and the fruit of that forbidden tree, whose mortal tast brought death into the world, and all our woe, with loss of eden, till one greater man restore us, and regain the blissful seat, sing heav'nly muse, that on the secret top of oreb, or of sinai, didst inspire that shepherd, who first taught the chosen seed, in the beginning how the heav'ns and earth rose out of chaos: or if sion hill delight thee more, and siloa's brook that flow'd fast by the oracle of god; i thence invoke thy aid to my adventrous song, that with no middle flight intends to soar above th' aonian mount, while it pursues things unattempted yet in prose or rhime. and chiefly thou, o spirit, that dost prefer before all temples th' upright heart and pure, instruct me, for thou know'st; thou from the first wast present, and with mighty wings outspread dove-like satst brooding on the vast abyss and mad'st it pregnant: what in me is dark illumin, what is low raise and support; that to the highth of this great argument i may assert eternal providence, and justifie the wayes of god to men. say first, for heav'n hides nothing from thy view nor the deep tract of hell, say first what cause mov'd our grand parents in that happy state, favour'd of heav'n so highly, to fall off from thir creator, and transgress his will for one restraint, lords of the world besides? who first seduc'd them to that foul revolt? th' infernal serpent; he it was, whose guile stird up with envy and revenge, deceiv'd the mother of mankind, what time his pride had cast him out from heav'n, with all his host of rebel angels, by whose aid aspiring to set himself in glory above his peers, he trusted to have equal'd the most high, if he oppos'd; and with ambitious aim against the throne and monarchy of god rais'd impious war in heav'n and battel proud with vain attempt. him the almighty power hurld headlong flaming from th' ethereal skie with hideous ruine and combustion down to bottomless perdition, there to dwell in adamantine chains and penal fire, who durst defie th' omnipotent to arms. nine times the space that measures day and night to mortal men, he with his horrid crew lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery gulfe confounded though immortal: but his doom reserv'd him to more wrath; for now the thought both of lost happiness and lasting pain torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes that witness'd huge affliction and dismay mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate: at once as far as angels kenn he views the dismal situation waste and wilde, a dungeon horrible, on all sides round as one great furnace flam'd, yet from those flames no light, but rather darkness visible serv'd onely to discover sights of woe, regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace and rest can never dwell, hope never comes that comes to all; but torture without end still urges, and a fiery deluge, fed with ever-burning sulphur unconsum'd: such place eternal justice had prepar'd for those rebellious, here thir prison ordained in utter darkness, and thir portion set as far remov'd from god and light of heav'n as from the center thrice to th' utmost pole. o how unlike the place from whence they fell! there the companions of his fall, o'rewhelm'd with floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire, he soon discerns, and weltring by his side one next himself in power, and next in crime, long after known in palestine, and nam'd beelzebub. to whom th' arch-enemy, and thence in heav'n call'd satan, with bold words breaking the horrid silence thus began. if thou beest he; but o how fall'n! how chang'd from him, who in the happy realms of light cloth'd with transcendent brightness didst out-shine myriads though bright: if he whom mutual league, united thoughts and counsels, equal hope and hazard in the glorious enterprize, joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd in equal ruin: into what pit thou seest from what highth fall'n, so much the stronger prov'd he with his thunder: and till then who knew the force of those dire arms? yet not for those, nor what the potent victor in his rage can else inflict, do i repent or change, though chang'd in outward lustre; that fixt mind and high disdain, from sence of injur'd merit, that with the mightiest rais'd me to contend, and to the fierce contention brought along innumerable force of spirits arm'd that durst dislike his reign, and me preferring, his utmost power with adverse power oppos'd in dubious battel on the plains of heav'n, and shook his throne. what though the field be lost? all is not lost; the unconquerable will, and study of revenge, immortal hate, and courage never to submit or yield: and what is else not to be overcome? that glory never shall his wrath or might extort from me. to bow and sue for grace with suppliant knee, and deifie his power, who from the terrour of this arm so late doubted his empire, that were low indeed, that were an ignominy and shame beneath this downfall; since by fate the strength of gods and this empyreal substance cannot fail, since through experience of this great event in arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't, we may with more successful hope resolve to wage by force or guile eternal warr irreconcileable, to our grand foe, who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy sole reigning holds the tyranny of heav'n. so spake th' apostate angel, though in pain, vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare: and him thus answer'd soon his bold compeer. o prince, o chief of many throned powers, that led th' imbattelld seraphim to warr under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds fearless, endanger'd heav'ns perpetual king; and put to proof his sigh supremacy, whether upheld by strength, or chance, or fate, too well i see and rue the dire event, that with sad overthrow and foul defeat hath lost us heav'n, and all this mighty host in horrible destruction laid thus low, as far as gods and heav'nly essences can perish: for the mind and spirit remains invincible, and vigour soon returns, though all our glory extinct and happy state here swallow'd up in endless misery. but what if he our conquerour, (whom i now of force believe almighty, since no less then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours) have left us this our spirit and strength intire strongly to suffer and support our pains, that we may so suffice his vengeful ire, or do him mightier service as his thralls by right of warr, what e're his business be here in the heart of hell to work in fire, or do his errands in the gloomy deep; what can it then avail though yet we feel strength undiminisht, or eternal being to undergo eternal punishment? whereto with speedy words th' arch-fiend reply'd. fall'n cherube, to be weak is miserable doing or suffering: but of this be sure, to do ought good never will be our task, but ever to do ill our sole delight, as being the contrary to his high will whom we resist. if then his providence out of our evil seek to bring forth good, our labour must be to pervert that end, and out of good still to find means of evil; which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps shall grieve him, if i fail not, and disturb his inmost counsels from thir destind aim. but see the angry victor hath recall'd his ministers of vengeance and pursuit back to the gates of heav'n: the sulphurous hail shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid the fiery surge, that from the precipice of heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the thunder, wing'd with red lightning and impetuous rage, perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now to bellow through the vast and boundless deep. let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn, or satiate fury yield it from our foe. seest thou yon dreary plain, forlorn and wilde, the seat of desolation, voyd of light, save what the glimmering of these livid flames casts pale and dreadful? thither let us tend from off the tossing of these fiery waves, there rest, if any rest can harbour there, and reassembling our afflicted powers, consult how we may henceforth most offend our enemy, our own loss how repair, how overcome this dire calamity, what reinforcement we may gain from hope, if not what resolution from despare. thus satan to his neerest mate with head up-lift above the wave, and eyes that sparkling blaz'd, his other parts besides prone on the flood, extended long and large lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge as whom the fables name of monstrous size, titanian, or earth-born, that warr'd on jove, briareos or typhon, whom the den by ancient tarsus held, or that sea-beast leviathan, which god of all his works created hugest that swim th' ocean stream: him haply slumbring on the norway foam the pilot of some small night-founder'd skiff, deeming some island, oft, as sea-men tell, with fixed anchor in his skaly rind moors by his side under the lee, while night invests the sea, and wished morn delayes: so stretcht out huge in length the arch-fiend lay chain'd on the burning lake, nor ever thence had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will and high permission of all-ruling heaven left him at large to his own dark designs, that with reiterated crimes he might heap on himself damnation, while he sought evil to others, and enrag'd might see how all his malice serv'd but to bring forth infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn on man by him seduc't, but on himself treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd. forthwith upright he rears from off the pool his mighty stature; on each hand the flames drivn backward slope thir pointing spires, and rowld in billows, leave i'th'midst a horrid vale. then with expanded wings he stears his flight aloft, incumbent on the dusky air that felt unusual weight, till on dry land he lights, as if it were land that ever burn'd with solid, as the lake with liquid fire; and such appear'd in hue, as when the force of subterranean wind transports a hill torn from pelorus, or the shatter'd side of thundring aetna, whose combustible and fewel'd entrals thence conceiving fire, sublim'd with mineral fury, aid the winds, and leave a singed bottom all involv'd with stench and smoak: such resting found the sole of unblest feet. him followed his next mate, both glorying to have scap't the stygian flood as gods, and by thir own recover'd strength, not by the sufferance of supernal power. is this the region, this the soil, the clime, said then the lost arch-angel, this the seat that we must change for heav'n, this mournful gloom for that celestial light? be it so, since he who now is sovran can dispose and bid what shall be right: fardest from him his best whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream above his equals. farewel happy fields where joy for ever dwells: hail horrours, hail infernal world, and thou profoundest hell receive thy new possessor: one who brings a mind not to be chang'd by place or time. the mind is its own place, and in it self can make a heav'n of hell, a hell of heav'n. what matter where, if i be still the same, and what i should be, all but less then he whom thunder hath made greater? here at least we shall be free; th' almighty hath not built here for his envy, will not drive us hence: here we may reign secure, and in my choyce to reign is worth ambition though in hell: better to reign in hell, then serve in heav'n. but wherefore let we then our faithful friends, th' associates and copartners of our loss lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious pool, and call them not to share with us their part in this unhappy mansion, or once more with rallied arms to try what may be yet regaind in heav'n, or what more lost in hell? so satan spake, and him beelzebub thus answer'd. leader of those armies bright, which but th' omnipotent none could have foyld, if once they hear that voyce, thir liveliest pledge of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft in worst extreams, and on the perilous edge of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults thir surest signal, they will soon resume new courage and revive, though now they lye groveling and prostrate on yon lake of fire, as we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd, no wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth. he scarce had ceas't when the superiour fiend was moving toward the shoar; his ponderous shield ethereal temper, massy, large and round, behind him cast; the broad circumference hung on his shoulders like the moon, whose orb through optic glass the tuscan artist views at ev'ning from the top of fesole, or in valdarno, to descry new lands, rivers or mountains in her spotty globe. his spear, to equal which the tallest pine hewn on norwegian hills, to be the mast of some great ammiral, were but a wand, he walkt with to support uneasie steps over the burning marle, not like those steps on heavens azure, and the torrid clime smote on him sore besides, vaulted with fire; nathless he so endur'd, till on the beach of that inflamed sea, he stood and call'd his legions, angel forms, who lay intrans't thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks in vallombrosa, where th' etrurian shades high overarch't imbowr; or scatterd sedge afloat, when with fierce winds orion arm'd hath vext the red-sea coast, whose waves orethrew busirus and his memphian chivalry, while with perfidious hatred they pursu'd the sojourners of goshen, who beheld from the safe shore thir floating carkases and broken chariot wheels, so thick bestrown abject and lost lay these, covering the flood, under amazement of thir hideous change. he call'd so loud, that all the hollow deep of hell resounded. princes, potentates warriers, the flowr of heav'n, once yours, now lost, if such astonishment as this can sieze eternal spirits; or have ye chos'n this place after the toyl of battel to repose your wearied vertue, for the ease you find to slumber here, as in the vales of heav'n? or in this abject posture have ye sworn to adore the conquerour? who now beholds cherube and seraph rowling in the flood with scatter'd arms and ensigns, till anon his swift pursuers from heav'n gates discern th' advantage, and descending tread us down thus drooping, or with linked thunderbolts transfix us to the bottom of this gulfe. awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n. they heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung upon the wing, as when men wont to watch on duty, sleeping found by whom they dread, rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake. nor did they not perceave the evil plight in which they were, or the fierce pains not feel; yet to thir generals voyce they soon obeyd innumerable. as when the potent rod of amrams son in egypts evill day wav'd round the coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud of locusts, warping on the eastern wind, that ore the realm of impious pharaoh hung like night, and darken'd all the land of nile: so numberless were those bad angels seen hovering on wind under the cope of hell 'twixt upper, nether, and surrounding fires; till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted spear of thir great sultan waving to direct thir course, in even ballance down they light on the firm brimstone, and fill all the plain; a multitude, like which the populous north pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to pass rhene or the danaw, when her barbarous sons came like a deluge on the south, and spread beneath gibralter to the lybian sands. forthwith from every squadron and each band the heads and leaders thither hast where stood thir great commander; godlike shapes and forms excelling human, princely dignities, and powers that earst in heaven sat on thrones; though of thir names in heav'nly records now be no memorial blotted out and ras'd by thir rebellion, from the books of life. nor had they yet among the sons of eve got them new names, till wandring ore the earth, through gods high sufferance for the tryal of man, by falsities and lyes the greatest part of mankind they corrupted to forsake god thir creator, and th' invisible glory of him that made them, to transform oft to the image of a brute, adorn'd with gay religions full of pomp and gold, and devils to adore for deities: then were they known to men by various names, and various idols through the heathen world. say, muse, the names then known, who first, who last, rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery couch, at thir great emperors call, as next in worth came singly where he stood on the bare strand, while the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof? the chief were those who from the pit of hell roaming to seek thir prey on earth, durst fix thir seats long after next the seat of god, thir altars by his altar, gods ador'd among the nations round, and durst abide jehovah thundring out of sion, thron'd between the cherubim; yea, often plac'd within his sanctuary it self thir shrines, abominations; and with cursed things his holy rites, and solemn feasts profan'd, and with thir darkness durst affront his light. first moloch, horrid king besmear'd with blood of human sacrifice, and parents tears, though for the noyse of drums and timbrels loud thir childrens cries unheard, that past through fire to his grim idol. him the ammonite worshipt in rabba and her watry plain, in argob and in basan, to the stream of utmost arnon. not content with such audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart of solomon he led by fraud to build his temple right against the temple of god on that opprobrious hill, and made his grove the pleasant vally of hinnom, tophet thence and black gehenna call'd, the type of hell. next chemos, th' obscene dread of moabs sons, from aroar to nebo, and the wild of southmost abarim; in hesebon and heronaim, seons realm, beyond the flowry dale of sibma clad with vines, and eleale to th' asphaltick pool. peor his other name, when he entic'd israel in sittim on thir march from nile to do him wanton rites, which cost them woe. yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarg'd even to that hill of scandal, but the grove of moloch homicide, lust hard by hate; till good josiah drove them hence to hell. with these cam they, who from the bordring flood of old euphrates to the brook that parts egypt from syrian ground, had general names of baalim and ashtaroth, those male, these feminine. for spirits when they please can either sex assume, or both; so soft and uncompounded is thir essence pure, nor ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or limb, nor founded on the brittle strength of bones, like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose dilated or condens't, bright or obscure, can execute thir aerie purposes, and works of love or enmity fulfill. for those the race of israel oft forsook thir living strength, and unfrequented left his righteous altar, bowing lowly down to bestial gods; for which thir heads as low bow'd down in battel, sunk before the spear of despicable foes. with these in troop came astoreth, whom the phoenicians call'd astarte, queen of heav'n, with crescent horns; to whose bright image nightly by the moon sidonian virgins paid thir vows and songs, in sion also not unsung, where stood her temple on th' offensive mountain, built by that uxorious king, whose heart though large, beguil'd by fair idolatresses, fell to idols foul. thammuz came next behind, whose annual wound in lebanon allur'd the syrian damsels to lament his fate in amorous dittyes all a summers day, while smooth adonis from his native rock ran purple to the sea, suppos'd with blood of thammuz yearly wounded; the love-tale infected sions daughters with like heat, whose wanton passions in the sacred porch ezekial saw, when by the vision led his eye survay'd the dark idolatries of alienated judah. next came one who mourn'd in earnest, when the captive ark maim'd his brute image, head and hands lopt off in his own temple, on the grunsel edge, where he fell flat, and sham'd his worshipers: dagon his name, sea monster, upward man and downward fish: yet had his temple high rear'd in azotus, dreaded through the coast of palestine, in gath and ascalon and accaron and gaza's frontier bounds. him follow'd rimmon, whose delightful seat was fair damascus, on the fertil banks of abbana and pharphar, lucid streams. he also against the house of god was bold: a leper once he lost and gain'd a king, ahaz his sottish conquerour, whom he drew gods altar to disparage and displace for one of syrian mode, whereon to burn his odious offrings, and adore the gods whom he had vanquisht. after these appear'd a crew who under names of old renown, osiris, isis, orus and thir train with monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd fanatic egypt and her priests, to seek thir wandring gods disguis'd in brutish forms rather then human. nor did israel scape th' infection when thir borrow'd gold compos'd the calf in oreb: and the rebel king doubl'd that sin in bethel and in dan, lik'ning his maker to the grazed ox, jehovah, who in one night when he pass'd from egypt marching, equal'd with one stroke both her first born and all her bleating gods belial came last, then whom a spirit more lewd fell not from heaven, or more gross to love vice for it self: to him no temple stood or altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee in temples and at altars, when the priest turns atheist, as did ely's sons, who fill'd with lust and violence the house of god. in courts and palaces he also reigns and in luxurious cities, where the noyse of riot ascends above thir loftiest towrs, and injury and outrage: and when night darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons of belial, flown with insolence and wine. witness the streets of sodom, and that night in gibeah, when the hospitable door expos'd a matron to avoid worse rape. these were the prime in order and in might; the rest were long to tell, though far renown'd, th' ionian gods, of javans issue held gods, yet confest later then heav'n and earth thir boasted parents; titan heav'ns first born with his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd by younger saturn, he from mightier jove his own and rhea's son like measure found; so jove usurping reign'd: these first in creet and ida known, thence on the snowy top of cold olympus rul'd the middle air thir highest heav'n; or on the delphian cliff, or in dodona, and through all the bounds of doric land; or who with saturn old fled over adria to th' hesperian fields, and ore the celtic roam'd the utmost isles. all these and more came flocking; but with looks down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd obscure some glimps of joy, to have found thir chief not in despair, to have found themselves not lost in loss itself; which on his count'nance cast like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride soon recollecting, with high words, that bore semblance of worth, not substance, gently rais'd thir fanting courage, and dispel'd thir fears. then strait commands that at the warlike sound of trumpets loud and clarions be upreard his mighty standard; that proud honour claim'd azazel as his right, a cherube tall: who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurld th' imperial ensign, which full high advanc't shon like a meteor streaming to the wind with gemms and golden lustre rich imblaz'd, seraphic arms and trophies: all the while sonorous mettal blowing martial sounds: at which the universal host upsent a shout that tore hells concave, and beyond frighted the reign of chaos and old night. all in a moment through the gloom were seen ten thousand banners rise into the air with orient colours waving: with them rose a forrest huge of spears: and thronging helms appear'd, and serried shields in thick array of depth immeasurable: anon they move in perfect phalanx to the dorian mood of flutes and soft recorders; such as rais'd to hight of noblest temper hero's old arming to battel, and in stead of rage deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd with dread of death to flight or foul retreat, nor wanting power to mitigate and swage with solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain from mortal or immortal minds. thus they breathing united force with fixed thought mov'd on in silence to soft pipes that charm'd thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now advanc't in view, they stand, a horrid front of dreadful length and dazling arms, in guise of warriers old with order'd spear and shield, awaiting what command thir mighty chief had to impose: he through the armed files darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse the whole battalion views, thir order due, thir visages and stature as of gods, thir number last he summs. and now his heart distends with pride, and hardning in his strength glories: for never since created man, met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these could merit more then that small infantry warr'd on by cranes: though all the giant brood of phlegra with th' heroic race were joyn'd that fought at theb's and ilium, on each side mixt with auxiliar gods; and what resounds in fable or romance of uthers sons begirt with british and armoric knights; and all who since baptiz'd or infidel jousted in aspramont or montalban, damasco, or marocco, or trebisond or whom biserta sent from afric shore when charlemain with all his peerage fell by fontarabbia. thus far these beyond compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd thir dread commander: he above the rest in shape and gesture proudly eminent stood like a towr; his form had yet not lost all her original brightness, nor appear'd less then arch angel ruind, and th' excess of glory obscur'd; as when the sun new ris'n looks through the horizontal misty air shorn of his beams, or from behind the moon in dim eclips disastrous twilight sheds on half the nations, and with fear of change perplexes monarch. dark'n'd so, yet shon above them all th' arch angel; but his face deep scars of thunder had intrencht, and care sat on his faded cheek, but under browes of dauntless courage, and considerate pride waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast signs of remorse and passion to behold the fellows of his crime, the followers rather (far other once beheld in bliss) condemn'd for ever now to have thir lot in pain, millions of spirits for his fault amerc't of heav'n, and from eternal splendors flung for his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood, thir glory witherd. as when heavens fire hath scath'd the forrest oaks, or mountain pines, with singed top thir stately growth though bare stands on the blasted heath. he now prepar'd to speak; whereat thir doubl'd ranks they bend from wing to wing, and half enclose him round with all his peers: attention held them mute. thrice he assayd, and thrice in spight of scorn, tears such as angels weep, burst forth: at last words interwove with sighs found out thir way. o myriads of immortal spirits, o powers matchless, but with th' almighty, and that strife was not inglorious, though th' event was dire, as this place testifies, and this dire change hateful to utter: but what power of mind foreseeing or presaging, from the depth of knowledge past or present, could have fear'd, how such united force of gods, how such as stood like these, could ever know repulse? for who can yet beleeve, though after loss, that all these puissant legions, whose exile hath emptied heav'n, shall fail to re-ascend self-rais'd, and repossess thir native seat? for mee be witness all the host of heav'n, if counsels different, or danger shun'd by mee, have lost our hopes. but he who reigns monarch in heav'n, till then as one secure sat on his throne, upheld by old repute, consent or custome, and his regal state put forth at full, but still his strength conceal'd, which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall. henceforth his might we know, and know our own so as not either to provoke, or dread new warr, provok't; our better part remains to work in close design, by fraud or guile what force effected not: that he no less at length from us may find, who overcomes by force, hath overcome but half his foe. space may produce new worlds; whereof so rife there went a fame in heav'n that he ere long intended to create, and therein plant a generation, whom his choice regard should favour equal to the sons of heaven: thither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps our first eruption, thither or elsewhere: for this infernal pit shall never hold caelestial spirits in bondage, nor th' abyss long under darkness cover. but these thoughts full counsel must mature: peace is despaird, for who can think submission? warr then, warr open or understood must be resolv'd. he spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs of mighty cherubim; the sudden blaze far round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'd against the highest, and fierce with grasped arms clash'd on thir sounding shields the din of war, hurling defiance toward the vault of heav'n. there stood a hill not far whose griesly top belch'd fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign that in his womb was hid metallic ore, the work of sulphur. thither wing'd with speed a numerous brigad hasten'd. as when bands of pioners with spade and pickax arm'd forerun the royal camp, to trench a field, or cast a rampart. mammon led them on, mammon, the least erected spirit that fell from heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks and thoughts were always downward bent, admiring more the riches of heav'ns pavement, trod'n gold, then aught divine or holy else enjoy'd in vision beatific: by him first men also, and by his suggestion taught ransack'd the center, and with impious hands rifl'd the bowels of thir mother earth for treasures better hid. soon had his crew op'nd into the hill a spacious wound and dig'd out ribs of gold. let none admire that riches grow in hell; that soyle may best deserve the precious bane. and here let those who boast in mortal things, and wond'ring tell of babel, and the works of memphian kings learn how thir greatest monuments of fame, and strength and art are easily out-done by spirits reprobate, and in an hour what in an age they with incessant toyle and hands innumerable scarce perform. nigh on the plain in many cells prepar'd that underneath had veins of liquid fire sluc'd from the lake, a second multitude with wond'rous art found out the massie ore, severing each kind, and scum'd the bullion dross: a third as soon had form'd within the ground a various mould, and from the boyling cells by strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook, as in an organ from one blast of wind to many a row of pipes the sound-board breaths. anon out of the earth a fabrick huge rose like an exhalation, with the sound of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet, built like a temple, where pilasters round were set, and doric pillars overlaid with golden architrave; nor did there want cornice or freeze, with bossy sculptures grav'n, the roof was fretted gold. not babilon, nor great alcairo such magnificence equal'd in all thir glories, to inshrine belus or serapis thir gods, or seat thir kings, when aegypt with assyria strove in wealth and luxurie. th' ascending pile stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores op'ning thir brazen foulds discover wide within, her ample spaces, o're the smooth and level pavement: from the arched roof pendant by suttle magic many a row of starry lamps and blazing cressets fed with naphtha and asphaltus yeilded light as from a sky. the hasty multitude admiring enter'd, and the work some praise and some the architect: his hand was known in heav'n by many a towred structure high, where scepter'd angels held thir residence, and sat as princes, whom the supreme king exalted to such power, and gave to rule, each in his hierarchie, the orders bright. nor was his name unheard or unador'd in ancient greece;

hath it spread no covering splendid as the sun-god's hair to veil or to reveal thy lordlier head? xii hath not the sunset strewn across the sea a way majestical enough for thee? what hour save this should be thine hour—and mine, if thou have care of any less divine than thine own soul; if thou take thought of me, marlowe, as all my soul takes thought of thine?

but ye— o, more than sunrise to the blind cold sea, that wailed aloud with all her waves all night, much more, being much more glorious, should you be. xxxiv as fire to frost, as ease to toil, as dew to flowerless fields, as sleep to slackening pain, as hope to souls long weaned from hope again returning, or as blood revived anew to dry-drawn limbs and every pulseless vein, even so toward us should no man be but you. xxxv one rose before the sunrise was, and one before the sunset, lovelier than the sun. and now the heaven is dark and bright and loud with wind and starry drift and moon and cloud, and night's cry rings in straining sheet and shroud, what help is ours if hope like yours be none? xxxvi o well-beloved, our brethren, if ye be, then are we not forsaken. this kind earth made fragrant once for all time with your birth, and bright for all men with your love, and worth the clasp and kiss and wedlock of the sea, were not your mother if not your brethren we. xxxvii because the days were dark with gods and kings and in time's hand the old hours of time as rods, when force and fear set hope and faith at odds, ye failed not nor abased your plume-plucked wings; and we that front not more disastrous things, how should we fail in face of kings and gods? xxxviii for now the deep dense plumes of night are thinned surely with winnowing of the glimmering wind whose feet we fledged with morning; and the breath begins in heaven that sings the dark to death. and all the night wherein men groaned and sinned sickens at heart to hear what sundawn saith. xxxix o first-born sons of hope and fairest, ye whose prows first clove the thought-unsounded sea whence all the dark dead centuries rose to bar the spirit of man lest truth should make him free, the sunrise and the sunset, seeing one star, take heart as we to know you that ye are. xl ye rise not and ye set not; we that say ye rise and set like hopes that set and rise look yet but seaward from a land-locked bay; but where at last the sea's line is the sky's and truth and hope one sunlight in your eyes, no sunrise and no sunset marks their day. <line>","nature,seas, rivers, & streams,stars, planets, heavens,arts & sciences,poetry & poets"

chill august, pale september, endured a woful while, and fell as falls an ember from forth a flameless pile: but golden-girt november bids all she looks on smile. the lustrous foliage, waning as wanes the morning moon, here falling, here refraining, outbraves the pride of june with statelier semblance, feigning no fear lest death be soon: as though the woods thus waning should wax to meet the moon. as though, when fields lie stricken by grey december's breath, these lordlier growths that sicken and die for fear of death should feel the sense requicken that hears what springtide saith and thrills for love, spring-stricken and pierced with april's breath. the keen white-winged north-easter that stings and spurs thy sea doth yet but feed and feast her with glowing sense of glee: calm chained her, storm released her, and storm's glad voice was he: south-wester or north-easter, thy winds rejoice the sea. v a dream, a dream is it all — the season, the sky, the water, the wind, the shore? a day-born dream of divine unreason, a marvel moulded of sleep — no more? for the cloudlike wave that my limbs while cleaving feel as in slumber beneath them heaving soothes the sense as to slumber, leaving sense of nought that was known of yore. a purer passion, a lordlier leisure, a peace more happy than lives on land, fulfils with pulse of diviner pleasure the dreaming head and the steering hand. i lean my cheek to the cold grey pillow, the deep soft swell of the full broad billow, and close mine eyes for delight past measure, and wish the wheel of the world would stand. the wild-winged hour that we fain would capture falls as from heaven that its light feet clomb, so brief, so soft, and so full the rapture was felt that soothed me with sense of home. to sleep, to swim, and to dream, for ever — such joy the vision of man saw never; for here too soon will a dark day sever the sea-bird's wing from the sea-wave's foam. a dream, and more than a dream, and dimmer at once and brighter than dreams that flee, the moment's joy of the seaward swimmer abides, remembered as truth may be. not all the joy and not all the glory must fade as leaves when the woods wax hoary; for there the downs and the sea-banks glimmer, and here to south of them swells the sea. <line>","love,realistic & complicated,romantic love,relationships,nature,seas, rivers, & streams"

12638,891,"<line> <line>high on a throne of royal state, which far outshon the wealth of ormus and of ind, or where the gorgeous east with richest hand showrs on her kings barbaric pearl and gold, satan exalted sat, by merit rais'd to that bad eminence; and from despair thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue vain warr with heav'n, and by success untaught his proud imaginations thus displaid. powers and dominions, deities of heav'n, for since no deep within her gulf can hold immortal vigor, though opprest and fall'n, i give not heav'n for lost. from this descent celestial vertues rising, will appear more glorious and more dread then from no fall, and trust themselves to fear no second fate: mee though just right, and the fixt laws of heav'n did first create your leader, next free choice, with what besides, in counsel or in fight, hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss thus farr at least recover'd, hath much more establisht in a safe unenvied throne yielded with full consent. the happier state in heav'n, which follows dignity, might draw envy from each inferior; but who here will envy whom the highest place exposes formost to stand against the thunderers aim your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share of endless pain? where there is then no good for which to strive, no strife can grow up there from faction; for none sure will claim in hell precedence, none, whose portion is so small of present pain, that with ambitious mind will covet more. with this advantage then to union, and firm faith, and firm accord, more then can be in heav'n, we now return to claim our just inheritance of old, surer to prosper then prosperity could have assur'd us; and by what best way, whether of open warr or covert guile, we now debate; who can advise, may speak. he ceas'd, and next him moloc, scepter'd king stood up, the strongest and the fiercest spirit that fought in heav'n; now fiercer by despair: his trust was with th' eternal to be deem'd equal in strength, and rather then be less car'd not to be at all; with that care lost went all his fear: of god, or hell, or worse he reck'd not, and these words thereafter spake. my sentence is for open warr: of wiles, more unexpert, i boast not: them let those contrive who need, or when they need, not now. for while they sit contriving, shall the rest, millions that stand in arms, and longing wait the signal to ascend, sit lingring here heav'ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place accept this dark opprobrious den of shame, the prison of his tyranny who reigns by our delay? no, let us rather choose arm'd with hell flames and fury all at once o're heav'ns high towrs to force resistless way, turning our tortures into horrid arms against the torturer; when to meet the noise of his almighty engin he shall hear infernal thunder, and for lightning see black fire and horror shot with equal rage among his angels; and his throne it self mixt with tartarean sulphur, and strange fire, his own invented torments. but perhaps the way seems difficult and steep to scale with upright wing against a higher foe. let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench of that forgetful lake benumm not still, that in our proper motion we ascend up to our native seat: descent and fall to us is adverse. who but felt of late when the fierce foe hung on our brok'n rear insulting, and pursu'd us through the deep, with what compulsion and laborious flight we sunk thus low? th' ascent is easie then; th' event is fear'd; should we again provoke our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find to our destruction: if there be in hell fear to be worse destroy'd: what can be worse then to dwell here, driv'n out from bliss, condemn'd in this abhorred deep to utter woe; where pain of unextinguishable fire must exercise us without hope of end the vassals of his anger, when the scourge inexorably, and the torturing hour calls us to penance? more destroy'd then thus we should be quite abolisht and expire. what fear we then? what doubt we to incense his utmost ire? which to the highth enrag'd, will either quite consume us, and reduce to nothing this essential, happier farr then miserable to have eternal being: or if our substance be indeed divine, and cannot cease to be, we are at worst on this side nothing; and by proof we feel our power sufficient to disturb his heav'n, and with perpetual inrodes to allarme, though inaccessible, his fatal throne: which if not victory is yet revenge. he ended frowning, and his look denounc'd desperate revenge, and battel dangerous to less then gods. on th' other side up rose belial, in act more graceful and humane; a fairer person lost not heav'n; he seemd for dignity compos'd and high exploit: but all was false and hollow; though his tongue dropt manna, and could make the worse appear the better reason, to perplex and dash maturest counsels: for his thoughts were low; to vice industrious, but to nobler deeds timorous and slothful: yet he pleas'd the ear, and with perswasive accent thus began. i should be much for open warr, o peers, as not behind in hate; if what was urg'd main reason to perswade immediate warr, did not disswade me most, and seem to cast ominous conjecture on the whole success: when he who most excels in fact of arms, in what he counsels and in what excels mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair and utter dissolution, as the scope of all his aim, after some dire revenge. first, what revenge? the towrs of heav'n are fill'd with armed watch, that render all access impregnable; oft on the bordering deep encamp thir legions, or with obscure wing scout farr and wide into the realm of night, scorning surprize. or could we break our way by force, and at our heels all hell should rise with blackest insurrection, to confound heav'ns purest light, yet our great enemy all incorruptible would on his throne sit unpolluted, and th' ethereal mould incapable of stain would soon expel her mischief, and purge off the baser fire victorious. thus repuls'd, our final hope is flat despair: we must exasperate th' almighty victor to spend all his rage, and that must end us, that must be our cure, to be no more; sad cure; for who would loose, though full of pain, this intellectual being, those thoughts that wander through eternity, to perish rather, swallowd up and lost in the wide womb of uncreated night, devoid of sense and motion? and who knows, let this be good, whether our angry foe can give it, or will ever? how he can is doubtful; that he never will is sure. will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, belike through impotence, or unaware, to give his enemies thir wish, and end them in his anger, whom his anger saves to punish endless? wherefore cease we then? say they who counsel warr, we are decreed, reserv'd and destin'd to eternal woe; whatever doing, what can we suffer more, what can we suffer worse? is this then worst, thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in arms? what when we fled amain, pursu'd and strook with heav'ns afflicting thunder, and besought the deep to shelter us? this hell then seem'd a refuge from those wounds: or when we lay chain'd on the burning lake? that sure was worse. what if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage and plunge us in the flames? or from above should intermitted vengeance arm again his red right hand to plague us? what if all her stores were open'd, and this firmament of hell should spout her cataracts of fire impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall one day upon our heads; while we perhaps designing or exhorting glorious warr, caught in a fierie tempest shall be hurl'd each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk under yon boyling ocean, wrapt in chains; there to converse with everlasting groans, unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd, ages of hopeless end; this would be worse. warr therefore, open or conceal'd, alike my voice disswades; for what can force or guile with him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye views all things at one view? he from heav'ns highth all these our motions vain, sees and derides; not more almighty to resist our might then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. shall we then live thus vile, the race of heav'n thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer here chains and these torments? better these then worse by my advice; since fate inevitable subdues us, and omnipotent decree, the victors will. to suffer, as to doe, our strength is equal, nor the law unjust that so ordains: this was at first resolv'd, if we were wise, against so great a foe contending, and so doubtful what might fall. i laugh, when those who at the spear are bold and vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear what yet they know must follow, to endure exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain, the sentence of thir conquerour: this is now our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, our supream foe in time may much remit his anger, and perhaps thus farr remov'd not mind us not offending, satisfi'd with what is punish't; whence these raging fires will slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames. our purer essence then will overcome thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not feel, or chang'd at length, and to the place conformd in temper and in nature, will receive familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain; this horror will grow milde, this darkness light, besides what hope the never-ending flight of future dayes may bring, what chance, what change worth waiting, since our present lot appeers for happy though but ill, for ill not worst, if we procure not to our selves more woe. thus belial with words cloath'd in reasons garb counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath, not peace: and after him thus mammon spake. either to disinthrone the king of heav'n we warr, if warr be best, or to regain our own right lost: him to unthrone we then may hope when everlasting fathe shall yeild to fickle chance and chaos judge the strife: the former vain to hope argues as vain the latter: for what place can be for us within heav'ns bound, unless heav'ns lord supream we overpower? suppose he should relent and publish grace to all, on promise made of new subjection; with what eyes could we stand in his presence humble, and receive strict laws impos'd, to celebrate his throne with warbl'd hymns, and to his god head sing forc't halleluia's; while he lordly sits our envied sovran, and his altar breathes ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers, our servile offerings. this must be our task in heav'n this our delight; how wearisom eternity so spent in worship paid to whom we hate. let us not then pursue by force impossible, by leave obtain'd unacceptable, though in heav'n, our state of splendid vassalage, but rather seek our own good from our selves, and from our own live to our selves, though in this vast recess, free, and to none accountable, preferring hard liberty before the easie yoke of servile pomp. our greatness will appeer then most conspicuous, when great things of small, useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse we can create, and in what place so e're thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain through labour and indurance. this deep world of darkness do we dread? how oft amidst thick clouds and dark doth heav'ns all-ruling sire choose to reside, his glory unobscur'd, and with the majesty of darkness round covers his throne; from whence deep thunders roar must'ring thir rage, and heav'n resembles hell? as he our darkness, cannot we his light imitate when we please? this desart soile wants not her hidden lustre, gemms and gold; nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise magnificence; and what can heav'n shew more? our torments also may in length of time become our elements, these piercing fires as soft as now severe, our temper chang'd into their temper; which must needs remove the sensible of pain. all things invite to peaceful counsels, and the settl'd state of order, how in safety best we may compose our present evils, with regard of what we are and were, dismissing quite all thoughts of warr: ye have what i advise. he scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld th' assembly, as when hollow rocks retain the sound of blustring winds, which all night long had rous'd the sea, now with hoarse cadence lull sea-faring men orewatcht, whose bark by chance or pinnace anchors in a craggy bay after the tempest: such applause was heard as mammon ended, and his sentence pleas'd, advising peace: for such another field they dreaded worse then hell: so much the fear of thunder and the sword of michael wrought still within them; and no less desire to found this nether empire, which might rise by pollicy, and long process of time, in emulation opposite to heav'n. which when beelzebub perceiv'd, then whom, satan except, none higher sat, with grave aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd a pillar of state; deep on his front engraven deliberation sat and public care; and princely counsel in his face yet shon, majestic though in ruin: sage he stood with atlantean shoulders fit to bear the weight of mightiest monarchies; his look drew audience and attention still as night or summers noon-tide air, while thus he spake. thrones and imperial powers, off-spring of heav'n ethereal vertues; or these titles now must we renounce, and changing stile be call'd princes of hell? for so the popular vote inclines, here to continue, and build up here a growing empire; doubtless; while we dream, and know not that the king of heav'n hath doom'd this place our dungeon, not our safe retreat beyond his potent arm, to live exempt from heav'ns high jurisdiction, in new league banded against his throne, but to remaine in strictest bondage, though thus far remov'd, under th' inevitable curb, reserv'd his captive multitude: for he, be sure in heighth or depth, still first and last will reign sole king, and of his kingdom loose no part by our revolt, but over hell extend his empire, and with iron scepter rule us here, as with his golden those in heav'n. what sit we then projecting peace and warr? warr hath determin'd us, and foild with loss irreparable; tearms of peace yet none voutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'n to us enslav'd, but custody severe, and stripes, and arbitrary punishment inflicted? and what peace can we return, but to our power hostility and hate, untam'd reluctance, and revenge though slow, yet ever plotting how the conqueror least may reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce in doing what we most in suffering feel? nor will occasion want, nor shall we need with dangerous expedition to invade heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or siege, or ambush from the deep. what if we find some easier enterprize? there is a place (if ancient and prophetic fame in heav'n err not) another world, the happy seat of some new race call'd man, about this time to be created like to us, though less in power and excellence, but favour'd more of him who rules above; so was his will pronounc'd among the gods, and by an oath, that shook heav'ns whol circumference, confirm'd. thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn what creatures there inhabit, of what mould, or substance, how endu'd, and what thir power, and where thir weakness, how attempted best, by force or suttlety: though heav'n be shut, and heav'ns high arbitrator sit secure in his own strength, this place may lye expos'd the utmost border of his kingdom, left to their defence who hold it: here perhaps som advantagious act may be achiev'd by sudden onset, either with hell fire to waste his whole creation, or possess all as our own, and drive as we were driven, the punie habitants, or if not drive, seduce them to our party, that thir god may prove thir foe, and with repenting hand abolish his own works. this would surpass common revenge, and interrupt his joy in our confusion, and our joy upraise in his disturbance; when his darling sons huri'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse thir frail original, and faded bliss, faded so soon. advise if this be worth attempting, or to sit in darkness here hatching vain empires. thus beelzebub pleaded his devilish counsel, first devis'd by satan, and in part propos'd: for whence, but from the author of all ill could spring so deep a malice, to confound the race of mankind in one root, and earth with hell to mingle and involve, done all to spite the great creatour? but thir spite still serves his glory to augment. the bold design pleas'd highly those infernal states, and joy sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full assent they vote: whereat his speech he thus renews. well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate, synod of gods, and like to what ye are, great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep will once more lift us up, in spight of fate, neerer our ancient seat; perhaps in view of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring arms and opportune excursion we may chance re-enter heav'n; or else in some milde zone dwell not unvisited of heav'ns fair light secure, and at the brightning orient beam purge off this gloom; the soft delicious air, to heal the scarr of these corrosive fires shall breathe her balme. but first whom shall we send in search of this new world, whom shall we find sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet the dark unbottom'd infinite abyss and through the palpable obscure find out his uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight upborn with indefatigable wings over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive the happy ile; what strength, what art can then suffice, or what evasion bear him safe through the strict senteries and stations thick of angels watching round? here he had need all circumspection, and we now no less choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send, the weight of all and our last hope relies. this said, he sat; and expectation held his look suspence, awaiting who appeer'd to second, or oppose, or undertake the perilous attempt: but all sat mute, pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each in others count'nance read his own dismay astonisht: none among the choice and prime of those heav'n-warring champions could be found so hardie as to proffer or accept alone the dreadful voyage; till at last satan, whom now transcendent glory rais'd above his fellows, with monarchal pride conscious of highest worth, unmov'd thus spake. o progeny of heav'n, empyreal thrones, with reason hath deep silence and demurr seis'd us, though undismaid: long is the way and hard, that out of hell leads up to light; our prison strong, this huge convex of fire, outrageous to devour, immures us round ninefold, and gates of burning adamant barr'd over us prohibit all egress. these past, if any pass, the void profound of unessential night receives him next wide gaping, and with utter loss of being threatens him, plung'd in that abortive gulf. if thence he scape into whatever world, or unknown region, what remains him less then unknown dangers and as hard escape. but i should ill become this throne, o peers, and this imperial sov'ranty, adorn'd with splendor, arm'd with power, if aught propos'd and judg'd of public moment, in the shape of difficulty or danger could deterr mee from attempting. wherefore do i assume these royalties, and not refuse to reign, refusing to accept as great a share of hazard as of honour, due alike to him who reigns, and so much to him due of hazard more, as he above the rest high honourd sits? go therfore mighty powers, terror of heav'n, though fall'n; intend at home, while here shall be our home, what best may ease the present misery, and render hell more tollerable; if there be cure or charm to respite or deceive, or slack the pain of this ill mansion: intermit no watch against a wakeful foe, while i abroad through all the coasts of dark destruction seek deliverance for us all: this enterprize none shall partake with me. thus saying rose the monarch, and prevented all reply, prudent, least from his resolution rais'd others among the chief might offer now (certain to be refus'd) what erst they feard; and so refus'd might in opinion stand his rivals, winning cheap the high repute which he through hazard huge must earn. but they dreaded not more th' adventure then his voice forbidding; and at once with him they rose; thir rising all at once was as the sound of thunder heard remote. towards him they bend with awful reverence prone; and as a god extoll him equal to the highest in heav'n: nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd, that for the general safety he despis'd his own: for neither do the spirits damn'd loose all thir virtue; least bad men should boast thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, or clos ambition varnisht o're with zeal. thus they thir doubtful consultations dark ended rejoycing in thir matchless chief: as when from mountain tops the dusky clouds ascending, while the north wind sleeps, o'respread heav'ns chearful face, the lowring element scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip snow, or showre; if chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet extend his ev'ning beam, the fields revive, the birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. o shame to men! devil with devil damn'd firm concord holds, men onely disagree of creatures rational, though under hope of heavenly grace: and god proclaiming peace, yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife among themselves, and levie cruel warres, wasting the earth, each other to destroy: as if (which might induce us to accord) man had not hellish foes anow besides, that day and night for his destruction waite. the stygian counsel thus dissolv'd; and forth in order came the grand infernal peers, midst came thir mighty paramount, and seemd alone th' antagonist of heav'n, nor less than hells dread emperour with pomp supream, and god-like imitated state; him round a globe of fierie seraphim inclos'd with bright imblazonrie, and horrent arms. then of thir session ended they bid cry with trumpets regal sound the great result: toward the four winds four speedy cherubim put to thir mouths the sounding alchymie by haralds voice explain'd: the hollow abyss heard farr and wide, and all the host of hell with deafning shout, return'd them loud acclaim. thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais'd by false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers disband, and wandring, each his several way pursues, as inclination or sad choice leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain the irksom hours, till this great chief return. part on the plain, or in the air sublime upon the wing, or in swift race contend, as at th' olympian games or pythian fields; part curb thir fierie steeds, or shun the goal with rapid wheels, or fronted brigads form. as when to warn proud cities warr appears wag'd in the troubl'd skie, and armies rush to battel in the clouds, before each van prick forth the aerie knights, and couch thir spears till thickest legions close; with feats of arms from either end of heav'n the welkin burns. others with vast typhoean rage more fell rend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air in whirlwind; hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. as when alcides from oechalia crown'd with conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore through pain up by the roots thessalian pines, and lichas from the top of oeta threw into th' euboic sea. others more milde, retreated in a silent valley, sing with notes angelical to many a harp thir own heroic deeds and hapless fall by doom of battel; and complain that fate free vertue should enthrall to force or chance. thir song was partial, but the harmony (what could it less when spirits immortal sing?) suspended hell, and took with ravishment the thronging audience. in discourse more sweet (for eloquence the soul, song charms the sense,) others apart sat on a hill retir'd, in thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high of providence, foreknowledge, will and fate, fixt fate, free will, foreknowledg absolute, and found no end, in wandring mazes lost. of good and evil much they argu'd then, of happiness and final misery, passion and apathie, and glory and shame, vain wisdom all, and false philosophie: yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm pain for a while or anguish, and excite fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brest with stubborn patience as with triple steel. another part in squadrons and gross bands, on bold adventure to discover wide that dismal world, if any clime perhaps might yield them easier habitation, bend four ways thir flying march, along the banks of four infernal rivers that disgorge into the burning lake thir baleful streams; abhorred styx the flood of deadly hate, sad acheron of sorrow, black and deep; cocytus, nam'd of lamentation loud heard on the ruful stream; fierce phlegeton whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. farr off from these a slow and silent stream, lethe the river of oblivion roules her watrie labyrinth, whereof who drinks, forthwith his former state and being forgets, forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. beyond this flood a frozen continent lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms of whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, a gulf profound as that serbonian bog betwixt damiata and mount casius old, where armies whole have sunk: the parching air burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of fire. thither by harpy-footed furies hail'd, at certain revolutions all the damn'd are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce, from beds of raging fire to starve in ice thir soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine immovable, infixt, and frozen round, periods of time, thence hurried back to fire. they ferry over this lethean sound both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment, and wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach the tempting stream, with one small drop to loose in sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, all in one moment, and so neer the brink; but fate withstands, and to oppose th' attempt medusa with gorgonian terror guards the ford, and of it self the water flies all taste of living wight, as once it fled the lip of tantalus. thus roving on in confus'd march forlorn, th' adventrous bands with shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast view'd first thir lamentable lot, and found no rest: through many a dark and drearie vaile they pass'd, and many a region dolorous, o're many a frozen, many a fierie alpe, rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death, a universe of death, which god by curse created evil, for evil only good, where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds, perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, abominable, inutterable, and worse than fables yet have feign'd, or fear conceiv'd, gorgons and hydra's, and chimera's dire. mean while the adversary of god and man, satan with thoughts inflam'd of highest design, puts on swift wings, and towards the gates of hell explores his solitary flight; som times he scours the right hand coast, som times the left, now shaves with level wing the deep, then soares up to the fiery concave touring high. as when farr off at sea a fleet descri'd hangs in the clouds, by aequinoctial winds close sailing from bengala, or the iles of ternate and tidore, whence merchants bring thir spicie drugs: they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole. so seem'd farr off the flying fiend: at last appeer hell bounds high reaching to the horrid roof, and thrice threefold the gates; three folds were brass, three iron, three of adamantine rock, impenetrable, impal'd with circling fire, yet unconsum'd. before the gates there sat on either side a formidable shape; the one seem'd woman to the waste, and fair, but ended foul in many a scaly fould voluminous and vast, a serpent arm'd with mortal sting: about her middle round a cry of hell hounds never ceasing bark'd with wide cerberian mouths full loud, and rung a hideous peal: yet, when they list, would creep, if aught disturb'd thir noyse, into her woomb, and kennel there, yet there still bark'd and howl'd, within unseen. farr less abhorrd than these vex'd scylla bathing in the sea that parts calabria from the hoarce trinacrian shore: nor uglier follow the night-hag, when call'd in secret, riding through the air she comes lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to dance with lapland witches, while the labouring moon eclipses at thir charms. the other shape, if shape it might be call'd that shape had none distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb, or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd, for each seem'd either; black it stood as night, fierce as ten furies, terrible as hell, and shook a dreadful dart; what seem'd his head the likeness of a kingly crown had on. satan was now at hand, and from his seat the monster moving onward came as fast with horrid strides, hell trembled as he strode. th' undaunted fiend what this might be admir'd, admir'd, not fear'd; god and his son except, created thing naught valu'd he nor shun'd; and with disdainful look thus first began. whence and what art thou, execrable shape, that dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance thy miscreated front athwart my way to yonder gates? through them i mean to pass, that be assur'd, without leave askt of thee: retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, hell-born, not to contend with spirits of heav'n. to whom the goblin full of wrauth reply'd, art thou that traitor angel, art thou hee, who first broke peace in heav'n and faith, till then unbrok'n, and in proud rebellious arms drew after him the third part of heav'ns sons conjur'd against the highest, for which both thou and they outcast from god, are here condemn'd to waste eternal dayes in woe and pain? and reck'n'st thou thy self with spirits of heav'n, hell-doom'd, and breath'st defiance here and scorn where i reign king, and to enrage thee more, thy king and lord? back to thy punishment, false fugitive, and to thy speed add wings, least with a whip of scorpions i pursue thy lingring, or with one stroke of this dart strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before. so spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape, so speaking and so threatning, grew tenfold more dreadful and deform: on th' other side incenst with indignation satan stood unterrifi'd, and like a comet burn'd, that fires the length of ophiucus huge in th' artick sky, and from his horrid hair shakes pestilence and warr. each at the head level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall hands no second stroke intend, and such a frown each cast at th' other, as when two black clouds with heav'ns artillery fraught, come rattling on over the caspian, then stand front to front hov'ring a space, till winds the signal blow to joyn thir dark encounter in mid air: so frownd the mighty combatants, that hell grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood; for never but once more was either like to meet so great a foe: and now great deeds had been achiev'd, whereof all hell had rung, had not the snakie sorceress that sat fast by hell gate, and kept the fatal key, ris'n, and with hideous outcry rush'd between. o father, what intends thy hand, she cry'd, against thy only son? what fury o son, possesses thee to bend that mortal dart against thy fathers head? and know'st for whom; for him who sits above and laughs the while at thee ordain'd his drudge, to execute what e're his wrath, which he calls justice, bids, his wrath which one day will destroy ye both. she spake, and at her words the hellish pest forbore, then these to her satan return'd: so strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange thou interposest, that my sudden hand prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds what it intends; till first i know of thee, what thing thou art, thus double-form'd, and why in this infernal vaile first met thou call'st me father, and that fantasm ca11'st my son? i know thee not, nor ever saw till now sight more detestable then him and thee. t' whom thus the portress of hell gate reply'd; hast thou forgot me then, and do i seem now in thine eyes so foul, once deemd so fair in heav'n, when at th' assembly, and in sight of all the seraphim with thee combin'd in bold conspiracy against heav'ns king, all on a sudden miserable pain surpris'd thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm in darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast threw forth, till on the left side op'ning wide, likest to thee in shape and count'nance bright, then shining heav'nly fair, a goddess arm'd out of thy head i sprung: amazement seis'd all th' host of heav'n; back they recoild affraid at first, and call'd me sin, and for a sign portentous held me; but familiar grown, i pleas'd, and with attractive graces won the most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft thy self in me thy perfect image viewing becam'st enamour'd, and such joy thou took'st with me in secret, that my womb conceiv'd a growing burden. mean while warr arose, and fields were fought in heav'n; wherein remaind (for what could else) to our almighty foe cleer victory, to our part loss and rout through all the empyrean: down they fell driv'n headlong from the pitch of heaven, down into this deep, and in the general fall i also; at which time this powerful key into my hand was giv'n, with charge to keep these gates for ever shut, which none can pass without my op'ning. pensive here i sat alone, but long i sat not, till my womb pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. at last this odious offspring whom thou seest thine own begotten, breaking violent way tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain distorted, all my nether shape thus grew transform'd: but he my inbred enemie forth issu'd, brandishing his fatal dart made to destroy: i fled, and cry'd out death; hell trembl'd at the hideous name, and sigh'd from all her caves, and back resounded death. i fled, but he pursu'd (though more, it seems, inflam'd with lust then rage) and swifter far, mee overtook his mother all dismaid, and in embraces forcible and foule ingendring with me, of that rape begot these yelling monsters that with ceasless cry surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv'd and hourly born, with sorrow infinite to me, for when they list into the womb that bred them they return, and howle and gnaw my bowels, thir repast; then bursting forth a fresh with conscious terrours vex me round, that rest or intermission none i find. before mine eyes in opposition sits grim death my son and foe, who sets them on, and me his parent would full soon devour for want of other prey, but that he knows his end with mine involvd; and knows that i should prove a bitter morsel, and his bane, when ever that shall be; so fate pronounc'd. but thou o father, i forewarn thee, shun his deadly arrow; neither vainly hope to be invulnerable in those bright arms, though temper'd heav'nly, for that mortal dint, save he who reigns above, none can resist. she finish'd, and the suttle fiend his lore soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth. dear daughter, since thou claim'st me for thy sire, and my fair son here showst me, the dear pledge of dalliance had with thee in heav'n, and joys then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know i come no enemie, but to set free from out this dark and dismal house of pain, both him and thee, and all the heav'nly host of spirits that in our just pretenses arm'd fell with us from on high: from them i go this uncouth errand sole, and one for all my self expose, with lonely steps to tread th' unfounded deep, and through the void immense to search with wandring quest a place foretold should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now created vast and round, a place of bliss in the pourlieues of heav'n, and therein plac't a race of upstart creatures, to supply perhaps our vacant room, though more remov'd, least heav'n surcharg'd with potent multitude might hap to move new broiles: be this or aught then this more secret now design'd, i haste to know, and this once known, shall soon return, and bring ye to the place where thou and death shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen wing silently the buxom air, imbalm'd with odours; there ye shall be fed and fill'd immeasurably, all things shall be your prey. he ceas'd, for both seemd highly pleasd, and death grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear his famine should be fill'd, and blest his mawe destin'd to that good hour: no less rejoyc'd his mother bad, and thus bespake her sire. the key of this infernal pit by due, and by command of heav'ns all-powerful king i keep, by him forbidden to unlock these adamantine gates; against all force death ready stands to interpose his dart, fearless to be o'rmatcht by living might. but what ow i to his commands above who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down into this gloom of tartarus profound, to sit in hateful office here confin'd, inhabitant of heav'n, and heav'nlie-born, here in perpetual agonie and pain, with terrors and with clamors compasst round of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed: thou art my father, thou my author, thou my being gav'st me; whom should i obey but thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon to that new world of light and bliss, among the gods who live at ease, where i shall reign at thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems thy daughter and thy darling, without end. thus saying, from her side the fatal key, sad instrument of all our woe, she took; and towards the gate rouling her bestial train, forthwith the huge porcullis high up drew, which but her self not all the stygian powers could once have mov'd; then in the key-hole turns th' intricate wards, and every bolt and bar of massie iron or sollid rock with ease unfast'ns: on a sudden op'n flie with impetuous recoile and jarring sound th' infernal dores, and on thir hinges grate harsh thunder, that the lowest bottom shook of erebus. she op'nd, but to shut excel'd her power; the gates wide op'n stood, that with extended wings a bannerd host under spread ensigns marching might pass through with horse and chariots rankt in loose array; so wide they stood, and like a furnace mouth cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame. before thir eyes in sudden view appear the secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark illimitable ocean without bound, without dimension, where length, breadth, & highth, and time and place are lost; where eldest night and chaos. ancestors of nature, hold eternal anarchie, amidst the noise of endless warrs, and by confusion stand. for hot, cold, moist, and dry, four champions fierce strive here for maistrie, and to battel bring thir embryon atoms; they around the flag of each his faction, in thir several clanns, light-arm'd or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow, swarm populous, unnumber'd as the sands of barca or cyrene's torrid soil, levied to side with warring winds, and poise thir lighter wings. to whom these most adhere, hee rules a moment; chaos umpire sits, and by decision more imbroiles the fray by which he reigns: next him high arbiter chance governs all. into this wilde abyss, the womb of nature and perhaps her grave, of neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire, but all these in thir pregnant causes mixt confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight, unless th' almighty maker them ordain his dark materials to create more worlds, into this wild abyss the warie fiend stood on the brink of hell and look'd a while, pondering his voyage; for no narrow frith he had to cross. nor was his eare less peal'd with noises loud and ruinous (to compare great things with small) then when bellona storms, with all her battering engines bent to rase som capital city; or less then if this frame of heav'n were falling, and these elements in mutinie had from her axle torn the stedfast earth. at last his sail-broad vannes he spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a league as in a cloudy chair ascending rides audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets a vast vacuitie: all unawares fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour down had been falling, had not by ill chance the strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud instinct with fire and nitre hurried him as many miles aloft: that furie stay'd, quencht in a boggie syrtis, neither sea, nor good dry land: nigh founderd on he fares, treading the crude consistence, half on foot, half flying; behoves him now both oare and saile. as when a gryfon through the wilderness with winged course ore hill or moarie dale, pursues the arimaspian, who by stelth had from his wakeful custody purloind the guarded gold: so eagerly the fiend ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, with head, hands, wings or feet pursues his way, and swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes: at length a universal hubbub wilde of stunning sounds and voices all confus'd born through the hollow dark assaults his eare with loudest vehemence: thither he plyes, undaunted to meet there what ever power or spirit of the nethermost abyss might in that noise reside, of whom to ask which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes bordering on light; when strait behold the throne of chaos, and his dark pavilion spread wide on the wasteful deep; with him enthron'd sat sable-vested night, eldest of things, the consort of his reign; and by them stood orcus and ades, and the dreaded name of demogorgon; rumor next and chance, and tumult and confusion all imbroild, and discord with a thousand various mouths. t' whom satan turning boldly, thus. ye powers and spirits of this nethermost abyss, chaos and ancient night, i come no spy, with purpose to explore or to disturb the secrets of your realm, but by constraint wandring this darksome desart, as my way, lies through your spacious empire up to light, alone, and without guide, half lost, i seek what readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds confine with heav'n; or if som other place from your dominion won, th' ethereal king possesses lately, thither to arrive i travel this profound, direct my course; directed no mean recompence it brings to your behoof, if i that region lost, all usurpation thence expell'd, reduce to her original darkness and your sway (which is my present journey) and once more erect the standard there of ancient night; yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge. thus satan; and him thus the anarch old with faultring speech and visage incompos'd answer'd. i know thee, stranger, who thou art, that mighty leading angel, who of late made head against heav'ns king, though overthrown. i saw and heard, for such a numerous host fled not in silence through the frighted deep with ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, confusion worse confounded; and heav'n gates pourd out by millions her victorious bands pursuing. i upon my frontieres here keep residence; if all i can will serve, that little which is left so to defend, encroacht on still through our intestine broiles weakning the scepter of old night: first hell your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath; now lately heaven and earth, another world hung ore my realm, link'd in a golden chain to that side heav'n from whence your legions fell: if that way be your walk, you have not farr; so much the neerer danger; go and speed; havock and spoil and ruin are my gain. he ceas'd; and satan staid not to reply, but glad that now his sea should find a shore, with fresh alacritie and force renew'd springs upward like a pyramid of fire into the wilde expanse, and through the shock of fighting elements, on all sides round environ'd wins his way; harder beset and more endanger'd, then when argo pass'd through bosporus betwixt the justling rocks: or when ulysses on the larbord shunnd charybdis, and by th' other whirlpool steard. so he with difficulty and labour hard mov'd on, with difficulty and labour hee; but hee once past, soon after when man fell, strange alteration! sin and death amain following his track, such was the will of heav'n, pav'd after him a broad and beat'n way over the dark abyss, whose boiling gulf tamely endur'd a bridge of wondrous length from hell continu'd reaching th' utmost orbe of this frail world; by which the spirits perverse with easie intercourse pass to and fro to tempt or punish mortals, except whom god and good angels guard by special grace. but now at last the sacred influence of light appears, and from the walls of heav'n shoots farr into the bosom of dim night a glimmering dawn; here nature first begins her fardest verge, and chaos to retire as from her outmost works a brok'd foe with tumult less and with less hostile din, that satan with less toil, and now with ease wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light and like a weather-beaten vessel holds gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn; or in the emptier waste, resembling air, weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold farr off th' empyreal heav'n, extended wide in circuit, undetermind square or round, with opal towrs and battlements adorn'd of living saphire, once his native seat; and fast by hanging in a golden chain this pendant world, in bigness as a starr of smallest magnitude close by the moon. thither full fraught with mischievous revenge, accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies. <line>","religion,christianity,god & the divine"

<line>we did not care: we knew we were <line> <line> the devil's own brigade: <line>and shaven head and feet of lead <line> <line> make a merry masquerade. <line>we tore the tarry rope to shreds <line> <line> with blunt and bleeding nails; <line>we rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors, <line> <line> and cleaned the shining rails: <line>and, rank by rank, we soaped the plank, <line> <line> and clattered with the pails. <line>we sewed the sacks, we broke the stones, <line> <line> we turned the dusty drill: <line>we banged the tins, and bawled the hymns, <line> <line> and sweated on the mill: <line>but in the heart of every man <line> <line> terror was lying still. <line>so still it lay that every day <line> <line> crawled like a weed-clogged wave: <line>and we forgot the bitter lot <line> <line> that waits for fool and knave, <line>till once, as we tramped in from work, <line> <line> we passed an open grave. <line>with yawning mouth the yellow hole <line> <line> gaped for a living thing; <line>the very mud cried out for blood <line> <line> to the thirsty asphalte ring: <line>and we knew that ere one dawn grew fair <line> <line> some prisoner had to swing. <line>right in we went, with soul intent <line> <line> on death and dread and doom: <line>the hangman, with his little bag, <line> <line> went shuffling through the gloom: <line>and each man trembled as he crept <line> <line> into his numbered tomb. <line>that night the empty corridors <line> <line> were full of forms of fear, <line>and up and down the iron town <line> <line> stole feet we could not hear, <line>and through the bars that hide the stars <line> <line> white faces seemed to peer. <line>he lay as one who lies and dreams <line> <line> in a pleasant meadow-land, <line>the watchers watched him as he slept, <line> <line> and could not understand <line>how one could sleep so sweet a sleep <line> <line> with a hangman close at hand. <line>but there is no sleep when men must weep <line> <line> who never yet have wept: <line>so we—the fool, the fraud, the knave— <line> <line> that endless vigil kept, <line>and through each brain on hands of pain <line> <line> another's terror crept. <line>alas! it is a fearful thing <line> <line> to feel another's guilt! <line>for, right within, the sword of sin <line> <line> pierced to its poisoned hilt, <line>and as molten lead were the tears we shed <line> <line> for the blood we had not spilt. <line>the warders with their shoes of felt <line> <line> crept by each padlocked door, <line>and peeped and saw, with eyes of awe, <line> <line> gray figures on the floor, <line>and wondered why men knelt to pray <line> <line> who never prayed before. <line>all through the night we knelt and prayed, <line> <line> mad mourners of a corse! <line>the troubled plumes of midnight were <line> <line> the plumes upon a hearse: <line>and bitter wine upon a sponge <line> <line> was the savour of remorse. <line>the gray cock crew, the red cock crew, <line> <line> but never came the day: <line>and crooked shapes of terror crouched, <line> <line> in the corners where we lay: <line>and each evil sprite that walks by night <line> <line> before us seemed to play. <line>they glided past, they glided fast, <line> <line> like travellers through a mist: <line>they mocked the moon in a rigadoon <line> <line> of delicate turn and twist, <line>and with formal pace and loathsome grace <line> <line> the phantoms kept their tryst. <line>with mop and mow, we saw them go, <line> <line> slim shadows hand in hand: <line>about, about, in ghostly rout <line> <line> they trod a saraband: <line>and damned grotesques made arabesques, <line> <line> like the wind upon the sand! <line>with the pirouettes of marionettes, <line> <line> they tripped on pointed tread: <line>but with flutes of fear they filled the ear, <line> <line> as their grisly masque they led, <line>and loud they sang, and long they sang, <line> <line> for they sang to wake the dead. <line>""oho!"" they cried, ""the world is wide, but fettered limbs go lame! and once, or twice, to throw the dice is a gentlemanly game, but he does not win who plays with sin in the secret house of shame."" no things of air these antics were, <line> <line> that frolicked with such glee: <line>to men whose lives were held in gyves, <line> <line> and whose feet might not go free, <line>ah! wounds of christ! they were living things, <line> <line> most terrible to see. <line>around, around, they waltzed and wound; <line> <line> some wheeled in smirking pairs; <line>with the mincing step of a demirep <line> <line> some sidled up the stairs: <line>and with subtle sneer, and fawning leer, <line> <line> each helped us at our prayers. <line>the morning wind began to moan, <line> <line> but still the night went on: <line>through its giant loom the web of gloom <line> <line> crept till each thread was spun: <line>and, as we prayed, we grew afraid <line> <line> of the justice of the sun. <line>the moaning wind went wandering round <line> <line> the weeping prison-wall: <line>till like a wheel of turning steel <line> <line> we felt the minutes crawl: <line>o moaning wind! what had we done <line> <line> to have such a seneschal? <line>at last i saw the shadowed bars, <line> <line> like a lattice wrought in lead, <line>move right across the whitewashed wall <line> <line> that faced my three-plank bed, <line>and i knew that somewhere in the world <line> <line> god's dreadful dawn was red. <line>at six o'clock we cleaned our cells, <line> <line> at seven all was still, <line>but the sough and swing of a mighty wing <line> <line> the prison seemed to fill, <line>for the lord of death with icy breath <line> <line> had entered in to kill. <line>he did not pass in purple pomp, <line> <line> nor ride a moon-white steed. <line>three yards of cord and a sliding board <line> <line> are all the gallows' need: <line>so with rope of shame the herald came <line> <line> to do the secret deed. <line>we were as men who through a fen <line> <line> of filthy darkness grope: <line>we did not dare to breathe a prayer, <line> <line> or to give our anguish scope: <line>something was dead in each of us, <line> <line> and what was dead was hope. <line>for man's grim justice goes its way <line> <line> and will not swerve aside: <line>it slays the weak, it slays the strong, <line> <line> it has a deadly stride: <line>with iron heel it slays the strong, <line> <line> the monstrous parricide! <line>we waited for the stroke of eight: <line> <line> each tongue was thick with thirst: <line>for the stroke of eight is the stroke of fate <line> <line> that makes a man accursed, <line>and fate will use a running noose <line> <line> for the best man and the worst. <line>we had no other thing to do, <line> <line> save to wait for the sign to come: <line>so, like things of stone in a valley lone, <line> <line> quiet we sat and dumb: <line>but each man's heart beat thick and quick, <line> <line> like a madman on a drum! <line>with sudden shock the prison-clock <line> <line> smote on the shivering air, <line>and from all the gaol rose up a wail <line> <line> of impotent despair, <line>like the sound the frightened marshes hear <line> <line> from some leper in his lair. <line>and as one sees most fearful things <line> <line> in the crystal of a dream, <line>we saw the greasy hempen rope <line> <line> hooked to the blackened beam, <line>and heard the prayer the hangman's snare <line> <line> strangled into a scream. <line>and all the woe that moved him so <line> <line> that he gave that bitter cry, <line>and the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats, <line> <line> none knew so well as i: <line>for he who lives more lives than one <line> <line> more deaths than one must die. <line>iv there is no chapel on the day <line> <line> on which they hang a man: <line>the chaplain's heart is far too sick, <line> <line> or his face is far too wan, <line>or there is that written in his eyes <line> <line> which none should look upon. <line>so they kept us close till nigh on noon, <line> <line> and then they rang the bell, <line>and the warders with their jingling keys <line> <line> opened each listening cell, <line>and down the iron stair we tramped, <line> <line> each from his separate hell. <line>out into god's sweet air we went, <line> <line> but not in wonted way, <line>for this man's face was white with fear, <line> <line> and that man's face was gray, <line>and i never saw sad men who looked <line> <line> so wistfully at the day. <line>i never saw sad men who looked <line> <line> with such a wistful eye <line>upon that little tent of blue <line> <line> we prisoners called the sky, <line>and at every careless cloud that passed <line> <line> in happy freedom by. <line>but there were those amongst us all <line> <line> who walked with downcast head, <line>and knew that, had each got his due, <line> <line> they should have died instead: <line>he had but killed a thing that lived, <line> <line> whilst they had killed the dead. <line>for he who sins a second time <line> <line> wakes a dead soul to pain, <line>and draws it from its spotted shroud, <line> <line> and makes it bleed again, <line>and makes it bleed great gouts of blood, <line> <line> and makes it bleed in vain! <line>like ape or clown, in monstrous garb <line> <line> with crooked arrows starred, <line>silently we went round and round <line> <line> the slippery asphalte yard; <line>silently we went round and round, <line> <line> and no man spoke a word. <line>silently we went round and round, <line> <line> and through each hollow mind <line>the memory of dreadful things <line> <line> rushed like a dreadful wind, <line>and horror stalked before each man, <line> <line> and terror crept behind. <line>the warders strutted up and down, <line> <line> and kept their herd of brutes, <line>their uniforms were spick and span, <line> <line> and they wore their sunday suits, <line>but we knew the work they had been at, <line> <line> by the quicklime on their boots. <line>for where a grave had opened wide, <line> <line> there was no grave at all: <line>only a stretch of mud and sand <line> <line> by the hideous prison-wall, <line>and a little heap of burning lime, <line> <line> that the man should have his pall. <line>for he has a pall, this wretched man, <line> <line> such as few men can claim: <line>deep down below a prison-yard, <line> <line> naked for greater shame, <line>he lies, with fetters on each foot, <line> <line> wrapt in a sheet of flame! <line>and all the while the burning lime <line> <line> eats flesh and bone away, <line>it eats the brittle bone by night, <line> <line> and the soft flesh by day, <line>it eats the flesh and bone by turns, <line> <line> but it eats the heart alway. <line>for three long years they will not sow <line> <line> or root or seedling there: <line>for three long years the unblessed spot <line> <line> will sterile be and bare, <line>and look upon the wondering sky <line> <line> with unreproachful stare. <line>they think a murderer's heart would taint <line> <line> each simple seed they sow. <line>it is not true!

12779,11860,"<line> <line>as he spoke we could hear, ever more loudly, the noise of the burning fires; the flood of flames was coming nearer and nearer. “my father, let me take you upon my shoulders and carry you with me. the burden will be easy. whatever happens, you and i will experience it together, peril or safety, whichever it will be. little iülus will come along beside me. my wife will follow behind us. and you, my servants, listen to what i say: just as you leave the limits of the city there is a mound, and the vestiges of a deserted temple of ceres, and a cypress tree that has been preserved alive for many years by the piety of our fathers. we will all meet there, though perhaps by different ways and, father, you must carry in your arms the holy images of our household gods; i, coming so late from the fighting and the carnage cannot presume to touch them until i have washed myself in running water.” thus i spoke. i take up the tawny pelt of a lion and cover my neck and my broad shoulders with it, and bowing down, i accept the weight of my father; iülus puts his hand in mine and goes along beside me, trying to match my steps as best he can, trying his best to keep up. my wife follows behind us, a little way back. so we all set out together, making our way among the shadows, and i, who only just a little while ago had faced, undaunted, showers of arrows and swarms of enemy greeks, am frightened by every slightest change in the air and startled by every slightest sound i hear, fearful for whom i walk with and whom i carry. and just as i had almost come to the gates and thought that i had almost gotten us free, i thought i heard the sound of many feet, and my father, peering intently into the shadows, cries out to me, “get away, get away, my son, my son, they are coming! i see their shining shields, i see the glow of their weapons in the dark!” i am alarmed, and i don’t know what happened but some power hostile to me distracts my wits and i am confused, and i lead us away by ways that i don’t know, and off the familiar streets that together we are following, and so, o god! some fate has taken away my wife, creüsa, my wife, away from me. what happened? did she wander from the way that we were going? did she fall back, having to rest some place back there, and so we left her? i did not know. i never saw her again, and as we went, i never turned to look behind, and never thought of her until we reached the mound and ceres’ ancient place. when all of us, at last, had gotten there, we all were there, but she had vanished and she wasn’t there. gone from her people, gone from her child, and her husband. what men or gods in my frenzy did i not cry out against? what worse sight had i seen? i left ascanius and anchises and the household gods in the care of my companions and i found a secluded place deep in a valley for them to hide, and i myself took up my shining weapons and sought the city again, determined, no matter what, to look for my creüsa everywhere in troy. i find my way along the walls and to, and through, the shadowed gate i’d left the city by; carefully, step by unseen step, in the dark, backwards the way i came i make my way; everywhere as i go fills me with terror; the very silence around me fills me with terror. i make my way to my home in case, in case, she’s gone back there. the greeks had invaded the house and set it on fire, and through the house the fire rolled up on the surge of the wind to the very roof, and the flames tower high above the burning house and the heat of the burning pours up into the sky. and so i go on, and once again i see the palace of priam, and the citadel, and in the empty courtyard of juno’s shrine there’s phoenix and dire ulysses, guarding the treasures taken from everywhere from the shrines that the greeks had set fire to; the golden bowls, the holy altar-tables, the stolen holy vestments; boys and trembling matrons stand around . . . i wander in the streets, in my desperation calling out her name, creüsa, creüsa, calling creüsa, over and over again. and as i went among the ruined buildings and through the streets of the ruined city, lo, suddenly there rose before my eyes the strangely magnified image of my wife. i was stupefied; my hair stood on end; my voice got caught in my throat. then she spoke to me and said words that altered everything for me: “beloved husband, what use is it for you to persist in this insanity of grief. what has happened here has happened not without the will of the gods. the high lord of olympus does not permit creüsa to go with you to be with you on your journey where you are going. long exile will be yours, ploughing across vast seas until you come to hesperia, where lydian tiber gently flows between rich husbanded fields and where you will be happy, a king, and wedded to a royal wife. give up your weeping now for your creüsa; i, a dardan woman and the spouse of divine venus’s son, will never see the scornful households of the myrmidons or the dolopians, and never have to be a scullion slave in service to some greek matron. the mighty mother keeps me on these shores. farewell and may your care protect and cherish your child and mine.” and having spoken thus, the image of her receded into air, leaving me weeping, with so much still to say. three times i tried to embrace her and to hold her; three times the image, clasped in vain, escaped as if it were a breeze or on the wings of a vanishing dream. and so, the night being over, i returned to my companions where they were. when i got there i was amazed to see how many others, women and men, had come, wretched survivors of the fall of the city, to join us in the exile and the journey, a heartbreaking company, come from everywhere, ready in their hearts and with their fortunes, to follow me wherever i was going. and now the morning star was rising over the highest ridges of ida, bringing in the day that was beginning; the danaans held the city behind the gates that they had locked. there was no hope of further help. and so i acknowledged this, and taking up the burden of my father once again, i sought the hills. <line>","love,classic love,heartache & loss,relationships,mythology & folklore,greek & roman mythology,heroes & patriotism"

""oh, bring us back once more the vanished days of yore, when the world with faith was filled; bring back the fervid zeal, the hearts of fire and steel, the hands that believe and build.
