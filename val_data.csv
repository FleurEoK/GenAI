10967,7860,"<line> <line>well i recall my father’s wife, the day he brought her home. his children looked for years of strife, and troubles sure to come— ungraciously we welcomed her, a thing to scorn and blame; and swore we never would confer on her, a mother’s name i see her yet—a girl in years, with eyes so blue and mild; she greeted us with smiles and tears, how sweetly too she smiled— she bent to kiss my sullen brow, with woman’s gentle grace; and laid her tiny hand of snow on my averted face— “henry—is this your son? she said— “dear boy—he now is mine— what not one kiss?—” i shook my head, “i am no son of thine!—” she sighed—and from her dimpled cheek the rosy colour fled; she turned away and did not speak, my thoughts were with the dead— there leaped from out my father’s eyes a jet of swarthy fire; that flashed on me in fierce surprise— i fled before his ire i heard her gentle voice entreat— “forgiveness for her sake”— which added swiftness to my feet, a sad and strange mistake— a year had scarcely rolled away when by that hated bride; i loved to linger half the day, in very joy and pride; her voice was music to mine ear, so soft its accent fell; “dear mother now”—and oh, how dear no words of mine can tell— she was so gentle, fair and kind, so pure in soul and free from art; that woman with her noble mind, subdued my rebel heart— i just had learned to know her worth, my father’s second choice to bless; when god removed her from the earth, and plunged us all in deep distress— hot fever smote with burning blight stretchd on a restless bed of pain; i moaning lay from morn till night with aching limbs and throbbing brain— four weary weeks beside my bed, she sat within a darkened room; untiring held my aching head, nor heeded silence—cold and gloom— and when my courage quite gave way, and fainter grew my struggling breath; she taught my stricken soul to pray and calmly meet approaching death— “fear not god’s angel, sent by him, the weary spirit to release; before the mortal eyes grow dim, floats down the white winged dove of peace”— there came a change—but fingers small, no longer smoothed my matted hair; she sprang not to my feeble call, nor helped to lift me to my chair— and i arose as from the dead, a life for her dear life was given; the angel who had watched my bed had vanished into heaven!— <line>","living,death,sorrow & grieving,relationships,family & ancestors,home life,philosophy"

10969,12702,"<line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>a satire upon the true-blue protestant poet t.s. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>all human things are subject to decay, <line>and, when fate summons, monarchs must obey: <line>this flecknoe found, who, like augustus, young <line>was call'd to empire, and had govern'd long: <line>in prose and verse, was own'd, without dispute <line>through all the realms of non-sense, absolute. <line>this aged prince now flourishing in peace, <line>and blest with issue of a large increase, <line>worn out with business, did at length debate <line>to settle the succession of the state: <line>and pond'ring which of all his sons was fit <line>to reign, and wage immortal war with wit; <line>cry'd, 'tis resolv'd; for nature pleads that he <line>should only rule, who most resembles me: <line>shadwell alone my perfect image bears, <line>mature in dullness from his tender years. <line>shadwell alone, of all my sons, is he <line>who stands confirm'd in full stupidity. <line>the rest to some faint meaning make pretence, <line>but shadwell never deviates into sense. <line>some beams of wit on other souls may fall, <line>strike through and make a lucid interval; <line>but shadwell's genuine night admits no ray, <line>his rising fogs prevail upon the day: <line>besides his goodly fabric fills the eye, <line>and seems design'd for thoughtless majesty: <line>thoughtless as monarch oaks, that shade the plain, <line>and, spread in solemn state, supinely reign. <line>heywood and shirley were but types of thee, <line>thou last great prophet of tautology: <line>even i, a dunce of more renown than they, <line>was sent before but to prepare thy way; <line>and coarsely clad in norwich drugget came <line>to teach the nations in thy greater name. <line>my warbling lute, the lute i whilom strung <line>when to king john of portugal i sung, <line>was but the prelude to that glorious day, <line>when thou on silver thames did'st cut thy way, <line>with well tim'd oars before the royal barge, <line>swell'd with the pride of thy celestial charge; <line>and big with hymn, commander of an host, <line>the like was ne'er in epsom blankets toss'd. <line>methinks i see the new arion sail, <line>the lute still trembling underneath thy nail. <line>at thy well sharpen'd thumb from shore to shore <line>the treble squeaks for fear, the basses roar: <line>echoes from pissing-alley, shadwell call, <line>and shadwell they resound from aston hall. <line>about thy boat the little fishes throng, <line>as at the morning toast, that floats along. <line>sometimes as prince of thy harmonious band <line>thou wield'st thy papers in thy threshing hand. <line>st. andre's feet ne'er kept more equal time, <line>not ev'n the feet of thy own psyche's rhyme: <line>though they in number as in sense excel; <line>so just, so like tautology they fell, <line>that, pale with envy, singleton forswore <line>the lute and sword which he in triumph bore <line>and vow'd he ne'er would act villerius more. <line>here stopt the good old sire; and wept for joy <line>in silent raptures of the hopeful boy. <line>all arguments, but most his plays, persuade, <line>that for anointed dullness he was made. <line> <line> close to the walls which fair augusta bind, <line>(the fair augusta much to fears inclin'd) <line>an ancient fabric, rais'd t'inform the sight, <line>there stood of yore, and barbican it hight: <line>a watch tower once; but now, so fate ordains, <line>of all the pile an empty name remains. <line>from its old ruins brothel-houses rise, <line>scenes of lewd loves, and of polluted joys. <line>where their vast courts, the mother-strumpets keep, <line>and, undisturb'd by watch, in silence sleep. <line>near these a nursery erects its head, <line>where queens are form'd, and future heroes bred; <line>where unfledg'd actors learn to laugh and cry, <line>where infant punks their tender voices try, <line>and little maximins the gods defy. <line>great fletcher never treads in buskins here, <line>nor greater jonson dares in socks appear; <line>but gentle simkin just reception finds <line>amidst this monument of vanish'd minds: <line>pure clinches, the suburbian muse affords; <line>and panton waging harmless war with words. <line>here flecknoe, as a place to fame well known, <line>ambitiously design'd his shadwell's throne. <line>for ancient decker prophesi'd long since, <line>that in this pile should reign a mighty prince, <line>born for a scourge of wit, and flail of sense: <line>to whom true dullness should some psyches owe, <line>but worlds of misers from his pen should flow; <line>humorists and hypocrites it should produce, <line>whole raymond families, and tribes of bruce. <line> <line> now empress fame had publisht the renown, <line>of shadwell's coronation through the town. <line>rous'd by report of fame, the nations meet, <line>from near bun-hill, and distant watling-street. <line>no persian carpets spread th'imperial way, <line>but scatter'd limbs of mangled poets lay: <line>from dusty shops neglected authors come, <line>martyrs of pies, and reliques of the bum. <line>much heywood, shirley, ogleby there lay, <line>but loads of shadwell almost chok'd the way. <line>bilk'd stationers for yeoman stood prepar'd, <line>and herringman was captain of the guard. <line>the hoary prince in majesty appear'd, <line>high on a throne of his own labours rear'd. <line>at his right hand our young ascanius sat <line>rome's other hope, and pillar of the state. <line>his brows thick fogs, instead of glories, grace, <line>and lambent dullness play'd around his face. <line>as hannibal did to the altars come, <line>sworn by his sire a mortal foe to rome; <line>so shadwell swore, nor should his vow be vain, <line>that he till death true dullness would maintain; <line>and in his father's right, and realm's defence, <line>ne'er to have peace with wit, nor truce with sense. <line>the king himself the sacred unction made, <line>as king by office, and as priest by trade: <line>in his sinister hand, instead of ball, <line>he plac'd a mighty mug of potent ale; <line>love's kingdom to his right he did convey, <line>at once his sceptre and his rule of sway; <line>whose righteous lore the prince had practis'd young, <line>and from whose loins recorded psyche sprung, <line>his temples last with poppies were o'er spread, <line>that nodding seem'd to consecrate his head: <line>just at that point of time, if fame not lie, <line>on his left hand twelve reverend owls did fly. <line>so romulus, 'tis sung, by tiber's brook, <line>presage of sway from twice six vultures took. <line>th'admiring throng loud acclamations make, <line>and omens of his future empire take. <line>the sire then shook the honours of his head, <line>and from his brows damps of oblivion shed <line>full on the filial dullness: long he stood, <line>repelling from his breast the raging god; <line>at length burst out in this prophetic mood: <line> <line> heavens bless my son, from ireland let him reign <line>to far barbadoes on the western main; <line>of his dominion may no end be known, <line>and greater than his father's be his throne. <line>beyond love's kingdom let him stretch his pen; <line>he paus'd, and all the people cry'd amen. <line>then thus, continu'd he, my son advance <line>still in new impudence, new ignorance. <line>success let other teach, learn thou from me <line>pangs without birth, and fruitless industry. <line>let virtuosos in five years be writ; <line>yet not one thought accuse thy toil of wit. <line>let gentle george in triumph tread the stage, <line>make dorimant betray, and loveit rage; <line>let cully, cockwood, fopling, charm the pit, <line>and in their folly show the writer's wit. <line>yet still thy fools shall stand in thy defence, <line>and justify their author's want of sense. <line>let 'em be all by thy own model made <line>of dullness, and desire no foreign aid: <line>that they to future ages may be known, <line>not copies drawn, but issue of thy own. <line>nay let thy men of wit too be the same, <line>all full of thee, and differing but in name; <line>but let no alien sedley interpose <line>to lard with wit thy hungry epsom prose. <line>and when false flowers of rhetoric thou would'st cull, <line>trust nature, do not labour to be dull; <line>but write thy best, and top; and in each line, <line>sir formal's oratory will be thine. <line>sir formal, though unsought, attends thy quill, <line>and does thy northern dedications fill. <line>nor let false friends seduce thy mind to fame, <line>by arrogating jonson's hostile name. <line>let father flecknoe fire thy mind with praise, <line>and uncle ogleby thy envy raise. <line>thou art my blood, where jonson has no part; <line>what share have we in nature or in art? <line>where did his wit on learning fix a brand, <line>and rail at arts he did not understand? <line>where made he love in prince nicander's vein, <line>or swept the dust in psyche's humble strain? <line>where sold he bargains, whip-stitch, kiss my arse, <line>promis'd a play and dwindled to a farce? <line>when did his muse from fletcher scenes purloin, <line>as thou whole eth'ridge dost transfuse to thine? <line>but so transfus'd as oil on waters flow, <line>his always floats above, thine sinks below. <line>this is thy province, this thy wondrous way, <line>new humours to invent for each new play: <line>this is that boasted bias of thy mind, <line>by which one way, to dullness, 'tis inclin'd, <line>which makes thy writings lean on one side still, <line>and in all changes that way bends thy will. <line>nor let thy mountain belly make pretence <line>of likeness; thine's a tympany of sense. <line>a tun of man in thy large bulk is writ, <line>but sure thou 'rt but a kilderkin of wit. <line>like mine thy gentle numbers feebly creep, <line>thy tragic muse gives smiles, thy comic sleep. <line>with whate'er gall thou sett'st thy self to write, <line>thy inoffensive satires never bite. <line>in thy felonious heart, though venom lies, <line>it does but touch thy irish pen, and dies. <line>thy genius calls thee not to purchase fame <line>in keen iambics, but mild anagram: <line>leave writing plays, and choose for thy command <line>some peaceful province in acrostic land. <line>there thou may'st wings display and altars raise, <line>and torture one poor word ten thousand ways. <line>or if thou would'st thy diff'rent talents suit, <line>set thy own songs, and sing them to thy lute. <line>he said, but his last words were scarcely heard, <line>for bruce and longvil had a trap prepar'd, <line>and down they sent the yet declaiming bard. <line>sinking he left his drugget robe behind, <line>born upwards by a subterranean wind. <line>the mantle fell to the young prophet's part, <line>with double portion of his father's art. <line> <line>","arts & sciences,humor & satire,poetry & poets,social commentaries,history & politics"

11008,12801,"<line> <line>listen, my children, and you shall hear of the midnight ride of paul revere, on the eighteenth of april, in seventy-five; hardly a man is now alive who remembers that famous day and year. he said to his friend, ""if the british march by land or sea from the town to-night, hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch of the north church tower as a signal light,— one, if by land, and two, if by sea; and i on the opposite shore will be, ready to ride and spread the alarm through every middlesex village and farm, for the country folk to be up and to arm."" then he said, ""good night!"" and with muffled oar silently rowed to the charlestown shore, just as the moon rose over the bay, where swinging wide at her moorings lay the somerset, british man-of-war; a phantom ship, with each mast and spar across the moon like a prison bar, and a huge black hulk, that was magnified by its own reflection in the tide. meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street, wanders and watches with eager ears, till in the silence around him he hears the muster of men at the barrack door, the sound of arms, and the tramp of feet, and the measured tread of the grenadiers, marching down to their boats on the shore. then he climbed the tower of the old north church, by the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread, to the belfry-chamber overhead, and startled the pigeons from their perch on the sombre rafters, that round him made masses and moving shapes of shade, — by the trembling ladder, steep and tall, to the highest window in the wall, where he paused to listen and look down a moment on the roofs of the town, and the moonlight flowing over all. beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead, in their night-encampment on the hill, wrapped in silence so deep and still that he could hear, like a sentinel's tread, the watchful night-wind, as it went creeping along from tent to tent, and seeming to whisper, ""all is well!"" a moment only he feels the spell of the place and the hour, and the secret dread of the lonely belfry and the dead; for suddenly all his thoughts are bent on a shadowy something far away, where the river widens to meet the bay, — a line of black that bends and floats on the rising tide, like a bridge of boats. meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride, booted and spurred, with a heavy stride on the opposite shore walked paul revere. now he patted his horse's side, now gazed at the landscape far and near, then, impetuous, stamped the earth, and turned and tightened his saddle girth; but mostly he watched with eager search the belfry-tower of the old north church, as it rose above the graves on the hill, lonely and spectral and sombre and still. and lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height a glimmer, and then a gleam of light! he springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns, but lingers and gazes, till full on his sight a second lamp in the belfry burns! a hurry of hoofs in a village street, a shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark, and beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet: that was all! and yet, through the gloom and the light, the fate of a nation was riding that night; and the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight, kindled the land into flame with its heat. he has left the village and mounted the steep, and beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep, is the mystic, meeting the ocean tides; and under the alders, that skirt its edge, now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge, is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides. it was twelve by the village clock, when he crossed the bridge into medford town. he heard the crowing of the cock, and the barking of the farmer's dog, and felt the damp of the river fog, that rises after the sun goes down. it was one by the village clock, when he galloped into lexington. he saw the gilded weathercock swim in the moonlight as he passed, and the meeting-house windows, blank and bare, gaze at him with a spectral glare, as if they already stood aghast at the bloody work they would look upon. it was two by the village clock, when he came to the bridge in concord town. he heard the bleating of the flock, and the twitter of birds among the trees, and felt the breath of the morning breeze blowing over the meadows brown. and one was safe and asleep in his bed who at the bridge would be first to fall, who that day would be lying dead, pierced by a british musket-ball. you know the rest. in the books you have read, how the british regulars fired and fled, — how the farmers gave them ball for ball, from behind each fence and farm-yard wall, chasing the red-coats down the lane, then crossing the fields to emerge again under the trees at the turn of the road, and only pausing to fire and load. so through the night rode paul revere; and so through the night went his cry of alarm to every middlesex village and farm, — a cry of defiance and not of fear, a voice in the darkness, a knock at the door, and a word that shall echo forevermore! for, borne on the night-wind of the past, through all our history, to the last, in the hour of darkness and peril and need, the people will waken and listen to hear the hurrying hoof-beats of that steed, and the midnight message of paul revere. <line>","social commentaries,history & politics,war & conflict,mythology & folklore,fairy-tales & legends,heroes & patriotism,independence day"

nut,—a land face, sea-blue-eyed,—hung in my mindwhen i had left him many a mile behind.all he said was: “nobody can’t stop ’ee. it’sa footpath, right enough. you see those bitsof mounds—that’s where they opened up the barrowssixty years since, while i was scaring sparrows.they thought as there was something to find there,but couldn’t find it, by digging, anywhere.”to turn back then and seek him, where was the use?there were three manningfords,—abbots, bohun, and bruce:and whether alton, not manningford, it was,my memory could not decide, becausethere was both alton barnes and alton priors.all had their churches, graveyards, farms, and byres,lurking to one side up the paths and lanes,seldom well seen except by aeroplanes;and when bells rang, or pigs squealed, or cocks crowed,then only heard. ages ago the roadapproached. the people stood and looked and turned.nor asked it to come nearer, nor yet learnedto move out there and dwell in all men’s dust.and yet withal they shot the weathercock, justbecause ’twas he crowed out of tune, they said:so now the copper weathercock is dead.if they had reaped their dandelions and soldthem fairly, they could have afforded gold.many years passed, and i went back againamong those villages, and looked for menwho might have known my ancient. he himselfhad long been dead or laid upon the shelf,i thought. one man i asked about him roaredat my description: “’tis old bottlesfordhe means, bill.” but another said: “of course,it was jack button up at the white horse.he’s dead, sir, these three years.” this lasted tilla girl proposed walker of walker’s hill,“old adam walker. adam's point you’ll seemarked on the maps.” “that was her roguery,”the next man said. he was a squire’s sonwho loved wild bird and beast, and dog and gunfor killing them. he had loved them from his birth,one with another, as he loved the earth.“the man may be like button, or walker, orlike bottlesford, that you want, but far morehe sounds like one i saw when i was a child.i could almost swear to him. the man was wildand wandered. his home was where he was free.everybody has met one such man as he.does he keep clear old paths that no one usesbut once a lifetime when he loves or muses?he is english as this gate, these flowers, this mire.and when at eight years old lob-lie-by-the-firecame in my books, this was the man i saw.he has been in england as long as dove and daw,calling the wild cherry tree the merry tree,the rose campion bridget-in-her-bravery;and in a tender mood he, as i guess,christened one flower love-in-idleness,and while he walked from exeter to leedsone april called all cuckoo-flowers milkmaids.from him old herbal gerard learnt, as a boy,to name wild clematis the traveller’s-joy.our blackbirds sang no english till his eartold him they called his jan toy ‘pretty dear.’(she was jan toy the lucky, who, having losta shilling, and found a penny loaf, rejoiced.)for reasons of his own to him the wrenis jenny pooter. before all other men’twas he first called the hog’s back the hog’s back.that mother dunch’s buttocks should not lacktheir name was his care. he too could explaintotteridge and totterdown and juggler’s lane:he knows, if anyone. why tumbling bay,inland in kent, is called so, he might say.“but little he says compared with what he does.if ever a sage troubles him he will buzzlike a beehive to conclude the tedious fray:and the sage, who knows all languages, runs away.yet lob has thirteen hundred names for a fool,and though he never could spare time for schoolto unteach what the fox so well expressed,on biting the cock’s head off,—quietness is best,—he can talk quite as well as anyoneafter his thinking is forgot and done.he first of all told someone else’s wife,for a farthing she’d skin a flint and spoil a knifeworth sixpence skinning it. she heard him speak:‘she had a face as long as a wet week’said he, telling the tale in after years.with blue smock and with gold rings in his ears,sometimes he is a pedlar, not too poorto keep his wit. this is tall tom that borethe logs in, and with shakespeare in the hallonce talked, when icicles hung by the wall.as herne the hunter he has known hard times.on sleepless nights he made up weather rhymeswhich others spoilt. and, hob being then his name,he kept the hog that thought the butcher cameto bring his breakfast ‘you thought wrong,’ said hob.when there were kings in kent this very lob,whose sheep grew fat and he himself grew merry,wedded the king’s daughter of canterbury;for he alone, unlike squire, lord, and king,watched a night by her without slumbering;he kept both waking. when he was but a ladhe won a rich man’s heiress, deaf, dumb, and sad,by rousing her to laugh at him. he carriedhis donkey on his back. so they were married.and while he was a little cobbler’s boyhe tricked the giant coming to destroyshrewsbury by flood. ‘and how far is it yet?’the giant asked in passing. ‘i forget;but see these shoes i‘ve worn out on the roadand we’re not there yet.’ he emptied out his loadof shoes for mending. the giant let fall from his spadethe earth for damming severn, and thus madethe wrekin hill; and little ercall hillrose where the giant scraped his boots. while stillso young, our jack was chief of gotham’s sages.but long before he could have been wise, agesearlier than this, while he grew thick and strongand ate his bacon, or, at times, sang a songand merely smelt it, as jack the giant-killerhe made a name. he too ground up the miller,the yorkshireman who ground men’s bones for flour.“do you believe jack dead before his hour?or that his name is walker, or bottlesford,or button, a mere clown, or squire, or lord?the man you saw,—lob-lie-by-the-fire, jack cade,jack smith, jack moon, poor jack of every trade,young jack, or old jack, or jack what-d’ye-call,jack-in-the-hedge, or robin-run-by-the-wall,robin hood, ragged robin, lazy bob,one of the lords of no man’s land, good lob,—although he was seen dying at waterloo,hastings, agincourt, and sedgemoor too,—lives yet. he never will admit he is deadtill millers cease to grind men’s bones for bread,not till our weathercock crows once againand i remove my house out of the laneon to the road.” with this he disappearedin hazel and thorn tangled with old-man’s-beard.but one glimpse of his back, as there he stood,choosing his way, proved him of old jack’s blood,young jack perhaps, and now a wiltshiremanas he has oft been since his days began. <line>","living,activities,travels & journeys,mythology & folklore"

which they not obeying, incurr'd, what could they less, the penaltie, and manifold in sin, deserv'd to fall. up into heav'n from paradise in haste th' angelic guards ascended, mute and sad for man, for of his state by this they knew, much wondring how the suttle fiend had stoln entrance unseen. soon as th' unwelcome news from earth arriv'd at heaven gate, displeas'd all were who heard, dim sadness did not spare that time celestial visages, yet mixt with pitie, violated not thir bliss. about the new-arriv'd, in multitudes th' ethereal people ran, to hear and know how all befell: they towards the throne supream accountable made haste to make appear with righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance, and easily approv'd;

no decree of mine concurring to necessitate his fall, or touch with lightest moment of impulse his free will, to her own inclining left in eevn scale. but fall'n he is, and now what rests but that the mortal sentence pass on his transgression, death denounc't that day, which he presumes already vain and void, because not yet inflicted, as he fear'd, by some immediate stroak; but soon shall find forbearance no acquittance ere day end. justice shall not return as bountie scorn'd. but whom send i to judge them? whom but thee vicegerent son, to thee i have transferr'd all judgement, whether in heav'n, or earth, or hell. easie it might be seen that i intend mercie collegue with justice, sending thee mans friend, his mediator, his design'd both ransom and redeemer voluntarie, and destin'd man himself to judge man fall'n. so spake the father, and unfoulding bright toward the right hand his glorie, on the son blaz'd forth unclouded deitie; he full resplendent all his father manifest express'd, and thus divinely answer'd milde. father eternal, thine is to decree, mine both in heav'n and earth to do thy will supream, that thou in mee thy son belov'd mayst ever rest well pleas'd. i go to judge on earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst, whoever judg'd, the worst on mee must light, when time shall be, for so i undertook before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine of right, that i may mitigate thir doom on me deriv'd, yet i shall temper so justice with mercie, as may illustrate most them fully satisfied, and thee appease. attendance none shall need, nor train, where none are to behold the judgment, but the judg'd, those two; the third best absent is condemn'd, convict by flight, and rebel to all law conviction to the serpent none belongs. thus saying, from his radiant seat he rose of high collateral glorie: him thrones and powers, princedoms, and dominations ministrant accompanied to heaven gate, from whence eden and all the coast in prospect lay. down he descended strait; the speed of gods time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing'd. now was the sun in western cadence low from noon, and gentle aires due at thir hour to fan the earth now wak'd, and usher in the eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole came the mild judge and intercessor both to sentence man: the voice of god they heard now walking in the garden, by soft windes brought to thir ears, while day declin'd, they heard, and from his presence hid themselves among the thickest trees, both man and wife, till god approaching, thus to adam call'd aloud. where art thou adam, wont with joy to meet my coming seen far off? i miss thee here, not pleas'd, thus entertaind with solitude, where obvious dutie erewhile appear'd unsaught: or come i less conspicuous, or what change absents thee, or what chance detains? come forth. he came, and with him eve, more loth, though first to offend, discount'nanc't both, and discompos'd; love was not in thir looks, either to god or to each other, but apparent guilt, and shame, and perturbation, and despaire, anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile. whence adam faultring long, thus answer'd brief. i heard thee in the garden, and of thy voice affraid, being naked, hid my self. to whom the gracious judge without revile repli'd. my voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear'd, but still rejoyc't, how is it now become so dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the tree whereof i gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat? to whom thus adam sore beset repli'd. o heav'n! in evil strait this day i stand before my judge, either to undergoe my self the total crime, or to accuse my other self, the partner of my life; whose failing, while her faith to me remaines, i should conceal, and not expose to blame by my complaint; but strict necessitie subdues me, and calamitous constraint least on my head both sin and punishment, however insupportable, be all devolv'd; though should i hold my peace, yet thou wouldst easily detect what i conceale. this woman whom thou mad'st to be my help, and gav'st me as thy perfet gift, so good, so fit, so acceptable, so divine, that from her hand i could suspect no ill, and what she did, whatever in it self, her doing seem'd to justifie the deed; shee gave me of the tree, and i did eate. to whom the sovran presence thus repli'd. was shee thy god, that her thou didst obey before his voice, or was shee made thy guide, superior, or but equal, that to her thou did'st resigne thy manhood, and the place wherein god set thee above her made of thee, and for thee, whose perfection farr excell'd hers in all real dignitie: adornd shee was indeed, and lovely to attract thy love, not thy subjection, and her gifts were such as under government well seem'd, unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part and person, had'st thou known thy self aright. so having said, he thus to eve in few: say woman, what is this which thou hast done? to whom sad eve with shame nigh overwhelm'd, confessing soon, yet not before her judge bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli'd. the serpent me beguil'd and i did eate. which when the lord god heard, without delay to judgement he proceeded on th' accus'd serpent though brute, unable to transferre the guilt on him who made him instrument of mischief, and polluted from the end of his creation; justly then accurst, as vitiated in nature: more to know concern'd not man (since he no further knew) nor alter'd his offence; yet god at last to satan first in sin his doom apply'd, though in mysterious terms, judg'd as then best: and on the serpent thus his curse let fall. because thou hast done this, thou art accurst above all cattle, each beast of the field; upon thy belly groveling thou shalt goe, and dust shalt eat all the dayes of thy life. between thee and the woman i will put enmitie, and between thine and her seed; her seed shall bruse thy head, thou bruise his heel. so spake this oracle, then verifi'd when jesus son of mary second eve, saw satan fall like lightning down from heav'n, prince of the aire; then rising from his grave spoild principalities and powers, triumpht in open shew, and with ascention bright captivity led captive through the aire, the realm it self of satan long usurpt, whom he shall tread at last under our feet; eeven hee who now foretold his fatal bruise, and to the woman thus his sentence turn'd. thy sorrow i will greatly multiplie by thy conception; children thou shalt bring in sorrow forth, and to thy husbands will thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule. on adam last thus judgement he pronounc'd. because thou hast heark'nd to the voice of thy wife, and eaten of the tree concerning which i charg'd thee, saying: thou shalt not eate thereof, curs'd is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow shalt eate thereof all the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth unbid, and thou shalt eate th' herb of th' field, in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground, for thou out of the ground wast taken, know thy birth, for dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne. so judg'd he man, both judge and saviour sent, and th' instant stroke of death denounc't that day remov'd farr off; then pittying how they stood before him naked to the aire, that now must suffer change, disdain'd not to begin thenceforth the form of servant to assume, as when he wash'd his servants feet so now as father of his familie he clad thir nakedness with skins of beasts, or slain, or as the snake with youthful coate repaid; and thought not much to cloath his enemies: nor hee thir outward onely with the skins of beasts, but inward nakedness, much more opprobrious, with his robe of righteousness, araying cover'd from his fathers sight. to him with swift ascent he up returnd, into his blissful bosom reassum'd in glory as of old, to him appeas'd all, though all-knowing, what had past with man recounted, mixing intercession sweet. meanwhile ere thus was sin'd and judg'd on earth, within the gates of hell sate sin and death, in counterview within the gates, that now stood open wide, belching outrageous flame farr into chaos, since the fiend pass'd through, sin opening, who thus now to death began. o son, why sit we here each other viewing idlely, while satan our great author thrives in other worlds, and happier seat provides for us his ofspring deare; it cannot be but that success attends him; if mishap, ere this he had return'd, with fury driv'n by his avenger, since no place like this can fit his punishment, or their revenge. methinks i feel new strength within me rise, wings growing, and dominion giv'n me large beyond this deep; whatever drawes me on, or sympathie, or som connatural force powerful at greatest distance to unite with secret amity things of like kinde by secretest conveyance. thou my shade inseparable must with mee along: for death from sin no power can separate. but least the difficultie of passing back stay his return perhaps over this gulfe impassable, impervious, let us try adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine not unagreeable, to found a path over this maine from hell to that new world where satan now prevailes, a monument of merit high to all th' infernal host, easing thir passage hence, for intercourse, or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead. nor can i miss the way, so strongly drawn by this new felt attraction and instinct. whom thus the meager shadow answerd soon. goe whither fate and inclination strong leads thee, i shall not lag behinde, nor erre the way, thou leading, such a sent i draw of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste the savour of death from all things there that live: nor shall i to the work thou enterprisest be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. so saying, with delight he snuff'd the smell of mortal change on earth. as when a flock of ravenous fowl, though many a league remote, against the day of battel, to a field, where armies lie encampt, come flying, lur'd with sent of living carcasses design'd for death, the following day, in bloodie fight. so sented the grim feature, and upturn'd his nostril wide into the murkie air, sagacious of his quarry from so farr. then both from out hell gates into the waste wide anarchie of chaos damp and dark flew divers, and with power (thir power was great) hovering upon the waters; what they met solid or slimie, as in raging sea tost up and down, together crowded drove from each side shoaling towards the mouth of hell. as when two polar winds blowing adverse upon the cronian sea, together drive mountains of ice, that stop th' imagin'd way beyond petsora eastward, to the rich cathaian coast. the aggregated soyle death with his mace petrific, cold and dry, as with a trident smote, and fix't as firm as delos floating once; the rest his look bound with gorgonian rigor not to move, and with asphaltic slime; broad as the gate, deep to the roots of hell the gather'd beach they fasten'd, and the mole immense wraught on over the foaming deep high archt, a bridge of length prodigious joyning to the wall immovable of this now fenceless world forfeit to death; from hence a passage broad, smooth, easie, inoffensive down to hell. so, if great things to small may be compar'd, xerxes, the libertie of greece to yoke, from susa his memnonian palace high came to the sea, and over hellespont bridging his way, europe with asia joyn'd, and scourg'd with many a stroak th' indignant waves. now had they brought the work by wondrous art pontifical, a ridge of pendent rock over the vext abyss, following the track of satan, to the self same place where hee first lighted from his wing, and landed safe from out of chaos to the out side bare of this round world: with pinns of adamant and chains they made all fast, too fast they made and durable; and now in little space the confines met of empyrean heav'n and of this world, and on the left hand hell with long reach interpos'd; three sev'ral wayes in sight, to each of these three places led. and now thir way to earth they had descri'd, to paradise first tending, when behold satan in likeness of an angel bright betwixt the centaure and the scorpion stearing his zenith, while the sun in aries rose: disguis'd he came, but those his children dear thir parent soon discern'd, though in disguise. hee after eve seduc't, unminded slunk into the wood fast by, and changing shape to observe the sequel, saw his guileful act by eve, though all unweeting, seconded upon her husband, saw thir shame that sought vain covertures; but when he saw descend the son of god to judge them terrifi'd hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun the present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth might suddenly inflict; that past, return'd by night, and listening where the hapless paire sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint, thence gatherd his own doom, which understood not instant, but of future time. with joy and tidings fraught, to hell he now return'd, and at the brink of chaos, neer the foot of this new wondrous pontifice, unhop't met who to meet him came, his ofspring dear. great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight of that stupendious bridge his joy encreas'd. long hee admiring stood, till sin, his faire inchanting daughter, thus the silence broke. o parent, these are thy magnific deeds, thy trophies, which thou view'st as not thine own, thou art thir author and prime architect: for i no sooner in my heart divin'd, my heart, which by a secret harmonie still moves with thine, join'd in connexion sweet, that thou on earth hadst prosper'd, which thy looks now also evidence, but straight i felt though distant from thee worlds between, yet felt that i must after thee with this thy son; such fatal consequence unites us three: hell could no longer hold us in her bounds, nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure detain from following thy illustrious track. thou hast atchiev'd our libertie, confin'd within hell gates till, now, thou us impow'rd to fortifie thus farr, and overlay with this portentous bridge the dark abyss. thine now is all this world, thy vertue hath won what thy hands builded not, thy wisdom gain'd with odds what warr hath lost, and fully aveng'd our foile in heav'n; here thou shalt monarch reign, there didst not; there let him still victor sway, as battel hath adjudg'd, from this new world retiring, by his own doom alienated, and henceforth monarchie with thee divide of all things parted by th' empyreal bounds, his quadrature, from thy orbicular world, or trie thee now more dang'rous to his throne. whom thus the prince of darkness answerd glad. fair daughter, and thou son and grandchild both, high proof ye now have giv'n to be the race of satan (for i glorie in the name, antagonist of heav'ns almightie king) amply have merited of me, of all th' infernal empire, that so neer heav'ns dore triumphal with triumphal act have met, mine with this glorious work, and made one realm hell and this world, one realm, one continent of easie thorough-fare. therefore while i descend through darkness, on your rode with ease to my associate powers, them to acquaint with these successes, and with them rejoyce, you two this way, among these numerous orbs all yours, right down to paradise descend; there dwell and reign in bliss, thence on the earth dominion exercise and in the aire, chiefly on man, sole lord of all declar'd, him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. my substitutes i send ye, and create plenipotent on earth, of matchless might issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now my hold of this new kingdom all depends, through sin to death expos'd by my exploit. if your joynt power prevailes, th' affaires of hell no detriment need feare, goe and be strong. so saying he dismiss'd them, they with speed thir course through thickest constellations held spreading thir bane; the blasted starrs lookt wan, and planets, planet-strook, real eclips then sufferd. th' other way satan went down the causey to hell gate; on either side disparted chaos over built exclaimd, and with rebounding surge the barrs assaild, that scorn'd his indignation: through the gate, wide open and unguarded, satan pass'd, and all about found desolate; for those appointed to sit there, had left thir charge, flown to the upper world; the rest were all farr to the inland retir'd, about the walls of pandaemonium, citie and proud seate of lucifer, so by allusion calld, of that bright starr to satan paragond. there kept thir watch the legions, while the grand in council sate, sollicitous what chance might intercept thir emperour sent, so hee departing gave command, and they observ'd. as when the tartar from his russian foe by astracan over the snowie plaines retires, or bactrian sophi from the hornes of turkish crescent, leaves all waste beyond the realm of aladule, in his retreate to tauris or casbeen. so these the late heav'n-banisht host, left desert utmost hell many a dark league, reduc't in careful watch round thir metropolis, and now expecting each hour their great adventurer from the search of forrein worlds: he through the midst unmarkt, in shew plebeian angel militant of lowest order, past; and from the dore of that plutonian hall, invisible ascended his high throne, which under state of richest texture spred, at th' upper end was plac't in regal lustre. down a while he sate, and round about him saw unseen: at last as from a cloud his fulgent head and shape starr bright appeer'd, or brighter, clad with what permissive glory since his fall was left him, or false glitter: all amaz'd at that so sudden blaze the stygian throng bent thir aspect, and whom they wish'd beheld, thir mighty chief returnd: loud was th' acclaime: forth rush'd in haste the great consulting peers, rais'd from thir dark divan, and with like joy congratulant approach'd him, who with hand silence, and with these words attention won. thrones, dominations, princedoms, vertues, powers, for in possession such, not onely of right, i call ye and declare ye now, returnd successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth triumphant out of this infernal pit abominable, accurst, the house of woe, and dungeon of our tyrant: now possess, as lords, a spacious world, to our native heaven little inferiour, by my adventure hard with peril great atchiev'd. long were to tell what i have don, what sufferd, with what paine voyag'd th' unreal, vast, unbounded deep of horrible confusion, over which by sin and death a broad way now is pav'd to expedite your glorious march; but i toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride th' untractable abysse, plung'd in the womb of unoriginal night and chaos wilde, that jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd my journey strange, with clamorous uproare protesting fate supreame; thence how i found the new created world, which fame in heav'n long had foretold, a fabrick wonderful of absolute perfection, therein man plac't in a paradise, by our exile made happie; him by fraud i have seduc'd from his creator, and the more to increase your wonder, with an apple; he thereat offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up both his beloved man and all his world, to sin and death a prey, and so to us, without our hazard, labour, or allarme, to range in, and to dwell, and over man to rule, as over all he should have rul'd. true is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather mee not, but the brute serpent in whose shape man i deceav'd: that which to mee belongs, is enmity, which he will put between mee and mankinde; i am to bruise his heel; his seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: a world who would not purchase with a bruise, or much more grievous pain? ye have th' account of my performance: what remains, ye gods, but up and enter now into full bliss. so having said, a while he stood, expecting thir universal shout and high applause to fill his eare, when contrary he hears on all sides, from innumerable tongues a dismal universal hiss, the sound of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long had leasure, wondring at himself now more; his visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare, his armes clung to his ribs, his leggs entwining each other, till supplanted down he fell a monstrous serpent on his belly prone, reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd, according to his doom: he would have spoke, but hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue to forked tongue, for now were all transform'd alike, to serpents all as accessories to his bold riot: dreadful was the din of hissing through the hall, thick swarming now with complicated monsters head and taile, scorpion and asp, and amphisbaena dire, cerastes hornd, hydrus, and ellops drear, and dipsas (not so thick swarm'd once the soil bedropt with blood of gorgon, or the isle ophiusa) but still greatest hee the midst, now dragon grown, larger then whom the sun ingenderd in the pythian vale on slime, huge python, and his power no less he seem'd above the rest still to retain; they all him follow'd issuing forth to th' open field, where all yet left of that revolted rout heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array, sublime with expectation when to see ln triumph issuing forth thir glorious chief; they saw, but other sight instead, a crowd of ugly serpents; horror on them fell, and horrid sympathie; for what they saw, they felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms, down fell both spear and shield, down they as fast, and the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form catcht by contagion, like in punishment, as in thir crime. thus was th' applause they meant, turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame cast on themselves from thir own mouths. there stood a grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change, his will who reigns above, to aggravate thir penance, laden with fruit like that which grew in paradise, the bait of eve us'd by the tempter: on that prospect strange thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining for one forbidden tree a multitude now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame; yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce, though to delude them sent, could not abstain, but on they rould in heaps, and up the trees climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks that curld megaera: greedily they pluck'd the frutage fair to sight, like that which grew neer that bituminous lake where sodom flam'd; this more delusive, not the touch, but taste deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay thir appetite with gust, instead of fruit chewd bitter ashes, which th' offended taste with spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd, hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft, with hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws with soot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell into the same illusion, not as man whom they triumph'd once lapst. thus were they plagu'd and worn with famin, long and ceasless hiss, till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd, yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo this annual humbling certain number'd days, to dash thir pride, and joy for man seduc't. however some tradition they dispers'd among the heathen of thir purchase got, and fabl'd how the serpent, whom they calld ophion with eurynome, the wide- encroaching eve perhaps, had first the rule of high olympus, thence by saturn driv'n and ops, ere yet dictaean jove was born. mean while in paradise the hellish pair too soon arriv'd, sin there in power before, once actual, now in body, and to dwell habitual habitant; behind her death close following pace for pace, not mounted yet on his pale horse: to whom sin thus began. second of satan sprung, all conquering death, what thinkst thou of our empire now, though earnd with travail difficult, not better farr then stil at hels dark threshold to have sate watch, unnam'd, undreaded, and thy self half starv'd? whom thus the sin-born monster answerd soon. to mee, who with eternal famin pine, alike is hell, or paradise, or heaven, there best, where most with ravin i may meet; which here, though plenteous, all too little seems to stuff this maw, this vast unhide-bound corps. to whom th' incestuous mother thus repli'd. thou therefore on these herbs, and fruits, and flours feed first, on each beast next, and fish, and fowle, no homely morsels, and whatever thing the sithe of time mowes down, devour unspar'd, till i in man residing through the race, his thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect, and season him thy last and sweetest prey. this said, they both betook them several wayes, both to destroy, or unimmortal make all kinds, and for destruction to mature sooner or later; which th' almightie seeing, from his transcendent seat the saints among, to those bright orders utterd thus his voice. see with what heat these dogs of hell advance to waste and havoc yonder world, which i so fair and good created, and had still kept in that state, had not the folly of man let in these wastful furies, who impute folly to mee, so doth the prince of hell and his adherents, that with so much ease i suffer them to enter and possess a place so heav'nly, and conniving-seem to gratifie my scornful enemies, that laugh, as if transported with some fit of passion, i to them had quitted all, at random yielded up to their misrule; and know not that i call'd and drew them thither my hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth which mans polluting sin with taint hath shed on what was pure, till cramm'd and gorg'd, nigh burst with suckt and glutted offal, at one sling of thy victorious arm, well-pleasing son, both sin, and death, and yawning grave at last through chaos hurld, obstruct the mouth of hell for ever, and seal up his ravenous jawes. then heav'n and earth renewd shall be made pure to sanctitie that shall receive no staine: till then the curse pronounc't on both precedes. he ended, and the heav'nly audience loud sung halleluia, as the sound of seas, through multitude that sung: just are thy ways, righteous are thy decrees on all thy works; who can extenuate thee? next, to the son, destin'd restorer of mankind, by whom new heav'n and earth shall to the ages rise, or down from heav'n descend. such was thir song, while the creator calling forth by name his mightie angels gave them several charge, as sorted best with present things. the sun had first his precept so to move, so shine, as might affect the earth with cold and heat scarce tollerable, and from the north to call decrepit winter, from the south to bring solstitial summers heat. to the blanc moone her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five thir planetarie motions and aspects in sextile, square, and trine, and opposite, of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne in synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt thir influence malignant when to showre, which of them rising with the sun, or falling, should prove tempestuous: to the winds they set thir corners, when with bluster to confound sea, aire, and shoar, the thunder when to rowle with terror through the dark aereal hall. some say he bid his angels turne ascanse the poles of earth twice ten degrees and more from the suns axle; they with labour push'd oblique the centric globe: som say the sun was bid turn reines from th' equinoctial rode like distant breadth to taurus with the seav'n atlantick sisters, and the spartan twins up to the tropic crab; thence down amaine by leo and the virgin and the scales, as deep as capricorne, to bring in change of seasons to each clime; else had the spring perpetual smil'd on earth with vernant flours, equal in days and nights, except to those beyond the polar circles; to them day had unbenighted shon, while the low sun to recompence his distance, in thir sight had rounded still th' horizon, and not known or east or west, which had forbid the snow from cold estotiland, and south as farr beneath magellan. at that tasted fruit the sun, as from thyestean banquet, turn'd his course intended; else how had the world inhabited, though sinless, more then now, avoided pinching cold and scorching heate? these changes in the heav'ns, though slow, produc'd like change on sea and land, sideral blast, vapour, and mist, and exhalation hot, corrupt and pestilent: now from the north of norumbega, and the samoed shoar bursting thir brazen dungeon, armd with ice and snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw, boreas and caecias and argestes loud and thrascias rend the woods and seas upturn; with adverse blast upturns them from the south notus and afer black with thundrous clouds from serraliona; thwart of these as fierce forth rush the levant and the ponent windes eurus and zephir with thir lateral noise, sirocco, and libecchio, thus began outrage from liveless things; but discord first daughter of sin, among th' irrational, death introduc'd through fierce antipathie: beast now with beast gan war, and fowle with fowle, and fish with fish; to graze the herb all leaving, devourd each other; nor stood much in awe of man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim glar'd on him passing: these were from without the growing miseries, which adam saw alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, to sorrow abandond, but worse felt within, and in a troubl'd sea of passion tost, thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint. o miserable of happie! is this the end of this new glorious world, and mee so late the glory of that glory, who now becom accurst of blessed, hide me from the face of god, whom to behold was then my highth of happiness: yet well, if here would end the miserie, i deserv'd it, and would beare my own deservings; but this will not serve; all that i eat or drink, or shall beget, is propagated curse. o voice once heard delightfully, encrease and multiply, now death to heare! for what can i encrease or multiplie, but curses on my head? who of all ages to succeed, but feeling the evil on him brought by me, will curse my head, ill fare our ancestor impure, for this we may thank adam; but his thanks shall be the execration; so besides mine own that bide upon me, all from mee shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound, on mee as on thir natural center light heavie, though in thir place. o fleeting joyes of paradise, deare bought with lasting woes! did i request thee, maker, from my clay to mould me man, did i sollicite thee from darkness to promote me, or here place in this delicious garden? as my will concurd not to my being, it were but right and equal to reduce me to my dust, desirous to resigne, and render back all i receav'd, unable to performe thy terms too hard, by which i was to hold the good i sought not. to the loss of that, sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added the sense of endless woes? inexplicable thy justice seems; yet to say truth, too late, i thus contest; then should have been refusd those terms whatever, when they were propos'd: thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good, then cavil the conditions? and though god made thee without thy leave, what if thy son prove disobedient, and reprov'd, retort, wherefore didst thou beget me? i sought it not: wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee that proud excuse? yet him not thy election, but natural necessity begot. god made thee of choice his own, and of his own to serve him, thy reward was of his grace, thy punishment then justly is at his will. be it so, for i submit, his doom is fair, that dust i am, and shall to dust returne: o welcom hour whenever! why delayes his hand to execute what his decree fixd on this day? why do i overlive, why am i mockt with death, and length'nd out to deathless pain? how gladly would i meet mortalitie my sentence, and be earth insensible, how glad would lay me down as in my mothers lap? there i should rest and sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more would thunder in my ears, no fear of worse to mee and to my ofspring would torment me with cruel expectation. yet one doubt pursues me still, least all i cannot die, least that pure breath of life, the spirit of man which god inspir'd, cannot together perish with this corporeal clod; then in the grave, or in some other dismal place who knows but i shall die a living death? o thought horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath of life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life and sin? the bodie properly hath neither. all of me then shall die: let this appease the doubt, since humane reach no further knows. for though the lord of all be infinite, is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so, but mortal doom'd. how can he exercise wrath without end on man whom death must end? can he make deathless death? that were to make strange contradiction, which to god himself impossible is held, as argument of weakness, not of power. will he, draw out, for angers sake, finite to infinite in punisht man, to satisfie his rigour satisfi'd never; that were to extend his sentence beyond dust and natures law, by which all causes else according still to the reception of thir matter act, not to th' extent of thir own spheare. but say that death be not one stroak, as i suppos'd, bereaving sense, but endless miserie from this day onward, which 1 feel begun both in me, and without me, and so last to perpetuitie; ay me, that fear comes thundring back with dreadful revolution on my defensless head; both death and i am found eternal, and incorporate both, nor i on my part single, in mee all posteritie stands curst: fair patrimonie that i must leave ye, sons; o were i able to waste it all my self, and leave ye none! so disinherited how would ye bless me now your curse! ah, why should all mankind for one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn'd, if guiltless? but from me what can proceed, but all corrupt, both mind and will deprav'd, not to do onely, but to will the same with me? how can they then acquitted stand in sight of god? him after all disputes forc't i absolve: all my evasions vain, and reasonings, though through mazes, lead me still but to my own conviction: first and last on mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring of all corruption, all the blame lights due; so might the wrauth. fond wish! couldst thou support that burden heavier then the earth to bear then all the world much heavier, though divided with that bad woman? thus what thou desir'st and what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope of refuge, and concludes thee miserable beyond all past example and future, to satan only like both crime and doom. o conscience, into what abyss of fears and horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which i find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd! thus adam to himself lamented loud through the still night, not now, as ere man fell, wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black air accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom, which to his evil conscience represented all things with double terror: on the ground outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft curs'd his creation, death as oft accus'd of tardie execution, since denounc't the day of his offence. why comes not death, said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke to end me? shall truth fail to keep her word, justice divine not hast'n to be just? but death comes not at call, justice divine mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries. o woods, o fountains, hillocks, dales and bowrs, with other echo late i taught your shades to answer, and resound farr other song. whom thus afflicted when sad eve bebeld, desolate where she sate, approaching nigh, soft words to his fierce passion she assay'd: but her with stern regard he thus repell'd. out of my sight, thou serpent, that name best befits thee with him leagu'd, thy self as false and hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, like his, and colour serpentine may shew thy inward fraud, to warn all creatures from thee henceforth; least that too heav'nly form, pretended to hellish falshood, snare them. but for thee i had persisted happie, had not thy pride and wandring vanitie, when lest was safe, rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd not to be trusted, longing to be seen though by the devil himself, him overweening to over-reach, but with the serpent meeting fool'd and beguil'd, by him thou, i by thee, to trust thee from my side, imagin'd wise, constant, mature, proof against all assaults, and understood not all was but a shew rather then solid vertu, all but a rib crooked by nature, bent, as now appears, more to the part sinister from me drawn, well if thrown out, as supernumerarie to my just number found. o why did god, creator wise, that peopl'd highest heav'n with spirits masculine, create at last this noveltie on earth, this fair defect of nature, and not fill the world at once with men as angels without feminine, or find some other way to generate mankind? this mischief had not then befall'n, and more that shall befall, innumerable disturbances on earth through femal snares, and straight conjunction with this sex: for either he never shall find out fit mate, but such as some misfortune brings him, or mistake, or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain through her perversness, but shall see her gaind by a farr worse, or if she love, withheld by parents, or his happiest choice too late shall meet, alreadie linkt and wedlock-bound to a fell adversarie, his hate or shame: which infinite calamitie shall cause to humane life, and houshold peace confound. he added not, and from her turn'd, but eve not so repulst, with tears that ceas'd not flowing, and tresses all disorderd, at his feet fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught his peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. forsake me not thus, adam, witness heav'n what love sincere, and reverence in my heart i beare thee, and unweeting have offended, unhappilie deceav'd; thy suppliant i beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, whereon i live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, thy counsel in this uttermost distress, my onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee, whither shall i betake me, where subsist? while yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps, between us two let there be peace, both joyning, as joyn'd in injuries, one enmitie against a foe by doom express assign'd us, that cruel serpent: on me exercise not thy hatred for this miserie befall'n, on me alreadie lost, mee then thy self more miserable; both have sin'd, but thou against god onely, i against god and thee, and to the place of judgment will return, there with my cries importune heaven, that all the sentence from thy head remov'd may light on me, sole cause to thee of all this woe, mee mee onely just object of his ire. she ended weeping, and her lowlie plight, immoveable till peace obtain'd from fault acknowledg'd and deplor'd, in adam wraught commiseration; soon his heart relented towards her, his life so late and sole delight, now at his feet submissive in distress, creature so faire his reconcilement seeking, his counsel whom she had displeas'd, his aide; as one disarm'd, his anger all he lost, and thus with peaceful words uprais'd her soon. unwarie, and too desirous, as before, so now of what thou knowst not, who desir'st the punishment all on thy self; alas, beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine his full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part, and my displeasure bearst so ill. if prayers could alter high decrees, i to that place would speed before thee, and be louder heard, that on my head all might be visited, thy frailtie and infirmer sex forgiv'n, to me committed and by me expos'd. but rise, let us no more contend, nor blame each other, blam'd enough elsewhere, but strive in offices of love, how we may light'n each others burden in our share of woe; since this days death denounc't, if ought i see, will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac't evill, a long days dying to augment our paine, and to our seed (o hapless seed!) deriv'd. to whom thus eve, recovering heart, repli'd. adam, by sad experiment i know how little weight my words with thee can finde, found so erroneous, thence by just event found so unfortunate; nevertheless, restor'd by thee, vile as i am, to place of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine thy love, the sole contentment of my heart living or dying, from thee i will not hide what thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n, tending to some relief of our extremes, or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, as in our evils, and of easier choice. if care of our descent perplex us most, which must be born to certain woe, devourd by death at last, and miserable it is to be to others cause of misery, our own begotten, and of our loines to bring into this cursed world a woful race, that after wretched life must be at last food for so foule a monster, in thy power it lies, yet ere conception to prevent the race unblest, to being yet unbegot. childless thou art, childless remaine: so death shall be deceav'd his glut, and with us two be forc'd to satisfie his rav'nous maw. but if thou judge it hard and difficult, conversing, looking, loving, to abstain from loves due rites, nuptial imbraces sweet, and with desire to languish without hope, before the present object languishing with like desire, which would be meserie and torment less then none of what we dread, then both our selves and seed at once to free from what we fear for both, let us make short, let us seek death, or he not found, supply with our own hands his office on our selves; why stand we longer shivering under feares, that shew no end but death, and have the power, of many ways to die the shortest choosing, destruction with destruction to destroy. she ended heer, or vehement despaire broke off the rest; so much of death her thoughts had entertaind, as di'd her cheeks with pale. but adam with such counsel nothing sway'd, to better hopes his more attentive minde labouring had rais'd, and thus to eve repli'd. eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems to argue in thee somthing more sublime and excellent then what thy minde contemnes; but self-destruction therefore saught, refutes that excellence thought in thee, and implies, not thy contempt, but anguish and regret for loss of life and pleasure overlov'd. or if thou covet death, as utmost end of miserie, so thinking to evade the penaltie pronounc't, doubt not but god hath wiselier arm'd his vengeful ire then so to be forestall'd; much more i fear least death so snatcht will not exempt us from the paine we are by doom to pay; rather such acts of contumacie will provoke the highest to make death in us live: then let us seek some safer resolution, which methinks i have in view, calling to minde with heed part of our sentence, that thy seed shall bruise the serpents head; piteous amends, unless be meant, whom i conjecture, our grand foe satan, who in the serpent hath contriv'd against us this deceit: to crush his head would be revenge indeed; which will be lost by death brought on our selves, or childless days resolv'd, as thou proposest; so our foe shall scape his punishment ordain'd, and wee instead shall double ours upon our heads. no more be mention'd then of violence against our selves, and wilful barrenness, that cuts us off from hope, and savours onely rancor and pride, impatience and despite, reluctance against god and his just yoke laid on our necks. remember with what mild and gracious temper he both heard and judg'd without wrauth or reviling; wee expected immediate dissolution, which we thought was meant by death that day, when lo, to thee pains onely in child-bearing were foretold, and bringing forth, soon recompenc't with joy, fruit of thy womb: on mee the curse aslope glanc'd on the ground, with labour i must earne my bread; what harm? idleness had bin worse; my labour will sustain me; and least cold or heat should injure us, his timely care hath unbesaught provided, and his hands cloath'd us unworthie, pitying while he judg'd; how much more, if we pray him, will his ear be open, and his heart to pitie incline, and teach us further by what means to shun th' inclement seasons, rain, ice, hail and snow, which now the skie with various face begins to shew us in this mountain, while the winds blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks of these fair spreading trees; which bids us seek som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish our limbs benumm'd, ere this diurnal starr leave cold the night, how we his gather'd beams reflected, may with matter sere foment, or by collision of two bodies grinde the air attrite to fire, as late the clouds justling or pusht with winds rude in thir shock tine the slant lightning, whose thwart flame driv'n down kindles the gummie bark of firr or pine, and sends a comfortable heat from farr, which might supplie the sun: such fire to use, and what may else be remedie or cure to evils which our own misdeeds have wrought, hee will instruct us praying, and of grace beseeching him, so as we need not fear to pass commodiously this life, sustain'd by him with many comforts, till we end in dust, our final rest and native home. what better can we do, then to the place repairing where he judg'd us, prostrate fall before him reverent, and there confess humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears watering the ground, and with our sighs the air frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek. undoubtedly he will relent and turn from his displeasure; in whose look serene, when angry most he seem'd and most severe, what else but favor, grace, and mercie shon? so spake our father penitent, nor eve felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place repairing where he judg'd them prostrate fell before him reverent, and both confess'd humbly thir faults, and pardon beg'd, with tears watering the ground, and with thir sighs the air frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek. <line>","religion,christianity,god & the divine"

11132,10771,"<line> <line>1 <line> <line>taking advantage of the relationships and interaction, which actually exist between what happens <line> <line>to her and her desire, she creates some metaphors both obvious and opaque, as screens of rays crisscrossing <line> <line>the landscape in which herself and what she expected from you in the way of support coincide, <line> <line>so that i and you resemble each other, now. the way they light the land like infrared without a trace <line> <line>on film, really, part of your image was linked so closely to my desire, it remained inside my body. <line> <line>it never reached the emotions, which tend to damage the body, but which memory requires. <line> <line>thus a formal device was discovered for detailing information that was intimate and largely unacceptable <line> <line>to what i thought i required from you, regarding beauty in idea and form. she expected distress <line> <line>to automatically bring about this beauty, like a woman’s theft of fire rope from your house, <line> <line>but not her hanging in the orchard by the house. she was a stranger to you. <line> <line>she was never in your consciousness. hence she was never forgotten. <line> <line>she is in you the way direct experience generates consciousness, adding the energy of its materialization. <line> <line>to live another person’s biography is not the same as to live his or her life. <line> <line>she constructs a story line or cluster of anecdotal details, like clothes around the body, <line> <line>instruments of both defense and expansion, which give meaning to fluctuations, such as in pleasures <line> <line>occurring between herself and you. her sunglasses swathed in feathers express <line> <line>the contingency of a light and a space, so that the anecdote of a hanging could be utilized <line> <line>as colorist or combinatory data, instead of her instinct for the imaginary in which what she imagines <line> <line>represents what happens, whether or not it misrepresents it. <line> <line>sometimes it happens during a routine she represents by evenness of light on the land <line> <line>or when things usually mean nothing, like harmony in light, what happens and something to mean <line> <line>join accidentally. the thing isn’t what it is, but it is like what it is. <line> <line>like a fake, it doesn’t mean anything, although there is something to mean, <line> <line>so that her solitude is the guise of unending repetition of a hanging or her relationship with you, <line> <line>in which all that is to be included will find a place. this is empathy or sharing her intuition with her. <line> <line>you look into someone’s eyes as if you were seeing through the face. <line> <line>2 <line> <line>because it’s not possible to absorb more than one insight at a time, <line> <line>there seems to be a contradiction between the visual or space, and the context or meaning. <line> <line>she felt deep uneasiness with the image of this sunset of unnatural energy, its sinister expression <line> <line>of an order of impossible beauty we thought we lost, accounting for the intensity of yellow light on the hill, <line> <line>which is not a thing, and it is not a metaphor, the way your life is not a metaphor to her, or <line> <line>the way intense light on the hill is a recollection en plein air, in the sense that it happened. <line> <line>soon the background turns gray and the hill regains its natural color, but there are three dimensions of gray. <line> <line>this is a metaphor for the fact that the hanged woman actually made contact with you, although you never knew her. <line> <line>there is a link with her appearance, as with sex, or the way a name is attached to something <line> <line>after naming it, by the occurrence of its name, in this case linking with the appearances <line> <line>or biographies of a whole parade of lovers, so what she thinks of as human help from him <line> <line>is no longer dependent on changing her desire for him in the present, but is a substitute for it. <line> <line>the landscape is empty and it is immanent. the context of the woman in its reality <line> <line>may differ from the context in which the viewer thinks about her, the element of transparency. <line> <line>the way the viewer thinks about her is the way low clouds extend a landscape. the viewer <line> <line>is acting on the landscape in consideration that the context of the viewer distinct from the context <line> <line>of general human help could be a metaphor for itself. <line> <line>there were yellow-leaved trees behind a screen of green ones at the edge of the orchard. <line> <line>they are not a border between organization and decay of autumn trees, which are organized. <line> <line>the yellow leaves around your feet have an impossible beauty that was achieved and then lost. <line> <line>a way you can define a woman is to remember everything the woman is not. <line> <line>if you move your head fast enough, you can all of a sudden discern the whole structure <line> <line>of the surface of each leaf, and it links in your stomach, as with sex. <line> <line>if you remember not desiring her fast enough, you can all of a sudden discern her whole body. <line> <line>you can feel in your stomach the way any moment that happened and in which you think about her goes <line> <line>a long way toward convincing you of the autonomy and pre-existence of her form. <line> <line>3 <line> <line>her concentration became a direct experience of his life, an erotic concentration. <line> <line>her biography of her persistently locates the point of impact of one’s own system of representations, <line> <line>insofar as vision itself is a representative operating on what she sees, <line> <line>and for which a particular light can represent an initial condition. even the slightest movement <line> <line>of a hand or a finger is controlled and emphasized as by a spotlight of this sensitiveness, <line> <line>the way repetition is a cessation of the potential for conscious experience, or death, <line> <line>visiting the same places during the same seasons, at almost the same hour, <line> <line>so that landscape could be a simple repetition, which thrives on reproduction, <line> <line>in order to resolve what is happening into its own combination or name of words in the form of its time, <line> <line>and in order to defer the story. <line> <line>in a way, her memory is a theory about how the hanged woman looked to her in the orchard, <line> <line>which she has to respect, in the sense that the landscape’s immanence is an organically developing <line> <line>failure of its language to speak its content. the connection between word and idea corresponding <line> <line>to the landscape is retained, but the connection between the word and the landscape is lost, <line> <line>so the shadow of a hill stays dark during lightning. how she sees the lightning <line> <line>is a time lapse into the planar dimension, a hierarchy of grammar or deference <line> <line>by way of the word belonging to her such as lady suicide or woman suicide, <line> <line>because the woman doesn’t die in her own absence or in effigy, so that <line> <line>no existing philosophy and no philosopher will know soon, enough points with enough speed <line> <line>to handle the richness of her reconstruction of her or him for long. he starts to see <line> <line>patterns in the words and the patterns are pretty to him and distract him. <line> <line>it is well known that lightning is attracted to body heat, a person on horseback <line> <line>or a large saguaro, the way a racket of birds in the morning is a kind of empathy for two people. <line> <line>if we retain the belief that her image of him or her, let’s say him, is a pre-requisite for <line> <line>gaining consciousness of the unknown person, we suppose there is no direct channel of communication <line> <line>to the unknown person, with the result that facts about him or her must exit into the world, <line> <line>before a life can be perceived between the light and dark of function or the object, and desire or the image. <line> <line>at any time one can turn into its opposite, like desire or a screen, and the object <line> <line>or her story and him, who does not so much convey an image as a background <line> <line>to the biography. so, he says, she must emphasize references and conditions of her own life <line> <line>over its memories, or what she sees of the landscape by the manner of its illumination, <line> <line>unless she says it is illuminated within the arms of a great cottonwood, yellow or green, <line> <line>a faith of imaginary or real connotation repeating itself from him, like alternating current <line> <line>or radioactive dirt being turned up that registers on her without marking her. <line> <line>4 <line> <line>her persistent observation, even after the frost, is of each leaf coinciding with its luminousness, <line> <line>because of its structure as a lighted space and which shows brightness in idea and form, <line> <line>so you have to maintain your own consciousness in order not to be unconscious with me. <line> <line>even if we can uniquely bridge the gap between the fact of a frost and the value <line> <line>of luminousness, and even though these intrinsic properties of the plant may not be what it feels. <line> <line>what it feels may be a space with pillars, so with light the space extends, as in what you believe <line> <line>to live with. a belief is a word-like object. you can focus your attention on it down to a point, <line> <line>like desire or memory of a strong feeling. you have a certain amount of control over your feeling <line> <line>about general human help by changing what you believe, which embodies the memories <line> <line>your speech is empowered to represent, she says. <line> <line>space is material, but seems to open up a beyond, which is thought to defy material in its failure <line> <line>to speak its content. it still cues this content by links or desires, as to a form of physical appearance. <line> <line>to the extent that she can reconstruct a context or pornography in her body suitable for a hanged woman, <line> <line>a contingency is beaten back, critically. in the sense that events happening at the same time are <line> <line>meaningful, but not connected, there are events which mean nothing, though there is something to mean. <line> <line>this is an easy way to expect with desire from moment to moment, while the woman was hanging herself, <line> <line>as if consistency and the quest for certainty were not emotional, <line> <line>as when a person begins telling a story, leaves move. <line> <line>he believed that when a life is valuable, there is further value when it is responded to <line> <line>as valuable, but this could occur through evaluative judgement, without his attendant emotion. <line> <line>the product is in one case consistent manners, in the other, beautiful manners. <line> <line> <line>","relationships,men & women,arts & sciences,philosophy,social

paths. they drove <line> <line>to the center of a wide field and stopped. old sweat, <line> <line>without the breeze of movement, prickled in the heat. <line> <line>a metal smell drifted, an untended apple grove <line> <line>baked on a hill, and the weeds droned, motory with bees. <line> <line>but suljic noticed none of these, fixed instead <line> <line>on the gaps in the field where bodies, all dead, <line> <line>matted down the wild carrot and chicory, their khakis <line> <line>splotched darkly, like a fawn's dappled haunches <line> <line>obscuring them. the men clambered down into the tall grass <line> <line>and lined up at gunpoint. suljic was sure the last <line> <line>good thing he'd ever see would be the apple branches <line> <line>drooping with fruit, but the man beside him grabbed <line> <line>his hand, and looked him in the face, as if <line> <line>suljic, just a bricklayer, had any assurances to give. <line> <line>he squeezed the hand back, hard, and felt a scab <line> <line>crossing the man's knuckles. he saw, too, a thin scar <line> <line>worrying the arch of his left eyebrow, much older, <line> <line>perhaps from a fall as a child from a ladder <line> <line>picking fruit. his hand was like a clump of mortar, <line> <line>and three nights without sleep had webbed his eyes red. <line> <line>and suljic suddenly stuttered to ask his name, <line> <line>what town was he from, his job—anything—but there came <line> <line>the crackle, like sometimes thunder, undecided <line> <line>whether to begin, that starts, stalls, then trips <line> <line>over itself, the sound crinkling from one <line> <line>end of the sky to the other. the sound took possession <line> <line>of his face until it, too, crinkled, his grip <line> <line>pulsed, and he fell forward. suljic winced <line> <line>in the tackle of bodies, and splayed down in the dirt <line> <line>flattening himself like a beetle, not hurt <line> <line>in any new way, not yet convinced <line> <line>he wasn't dead and didn't feel it. he heard the click <line> <line>of fresh clips sliding into place, and shut <line> <line>his eyes lightly, sure someone had seen he wasn't shot <line> <line>and would come finish it. but no one came. another truck <line> <line>rolled up. the men climbed down, and lined up, docilely. <line> <line>he recognized, solely by rhythm, a prayer, cut off <line> <line>by the crackle, the hush of crickets, the soft <line> <line>whump of bodies folding at the knees <line> <line>and knocked by bullets shoulder first <line> <line>into the grass. no one yelled. no one tried to run. <line> <line>another truck, another group, falling like a succession <line> <line>of bricks sliding off a hod. suljic finally pissed <line> <line>where he lay, and blended in all the better <line> <line>with the others. the noise stopped, and he cracked <line> <line>his eyes enough to see, across the backs <line> <line>like bleeding hills, a man strolling along the scatter <line> <line>of bodies with a pistol, putting a slug <line> <line>into the skull of anyone that still twitched <line> <line>or mumbled. then came the snort and low-pitched <line> <line>rumble of diesel engines as two backhoes dug <line> <line>a trench along the margin of all the collapsed <line> <line>bodies. impossibly, the crackling started anew, <line> <line>and when darkness finally settled, the squads continued <line> <line>in what light the backhoes' headlights threw. perhaps <line> <line>the shooting was over long before the sound <line> <line>left him, the crackle to his eardrums <line> <line>was like the rolling of a boat to his limbs <line> <line>echoing long after he'd reached dry ground. <line> <line>the soldiers left. still he didn't move, but eased <line> <line>his eyes full open. the moon above the orchard <line> <line>was shrinking higher, its light glossing the awkward <line> <line>pale forms that stubbled the dry weeds, <line> <line>glinting off teeth and eyes. he scuttled from beneath <line> <line>the arms and legs flopped sleepingly over <line> <line>his own, as though by drunkards or lovers, <line> <line>and rose like a foal to his numb feet, <line> <line>seeing throughout the field no man not touched <line> <line>by three dead others. he stood for a moment, trying <line> <line>to guess, even roughly, their number, multiplying <line> <line>bodies per square yard, but the math was too much, <line> <line>the count too huge. he stared at the faces beside him <line> <line>in the grass, like a man leaving something he knew <line> <line>he would someday have to return to, <line> <line>looking for the landmarks that would guide him— <line> <line>the crooked teeth, the welted cheek, the pale eyes eclipsed <line> <line>by half-shut lids, lolling upward, inward, swollen <line> <line>as though with weeping, blood from an unseen hole <line> <line>glistering down a chin line, crusting on lips. <line> <line>how could he explain his life, what could he say <line> <line>to those who weren't here to see, to the mothers and wives <line> <line>who'd swear for years their men were still alive, <line> <line>somewhere, the bodies never found, bulldozed into clay— <line> <line>would he tell them how he tiptoed, unable to avoid <line> <line>stepping on hands and ankles, or how the tears <line> <line>like a secret he'd harbored through three years <line> <line>of siege shook loose, and how he let them, no longer afraid <line> <line>of being found out and cut down by gunfire, <line> <line>or how he ran anyway, when he reached the open, quick <line> <line>as his bum leg would let him, without a look <line> <line>back at the faces turned like gourds in the dark mire. <line>","social commentaries,war & conflict"

although not feminine, she was maternal. then that thought passed. she shrugged and comforted herself. difficult, celibate, implacable, a final time she assessed the couple of compromised want, aware that nothing blackens the heart like a mariage blanc, and stamped them — mwah! mwah! — with the imprimatur of two kisses each. the relationship lasted three months. they had chosen wrongly, and plausibly they fell apart, like the couple in godard’s le mépris. had she wanted more than a cover? had he covered more than he wanted? the heart, behind its casements, is faceted, pronged, coveted, intricate and known by few. he could not be kept. she withdrew her money. reconciliation occurred after they ceased speaking. on their last night in monaco, she turned to him and wondered if her life had meant anything. he did not answer: he had developed a grace for offering himself to those who found truth difficult. when they left the restaurant, she paid using a heavy, black american express card. each took a doggy bag and smelled of cooked meat. this alignment of opposite sexes had provided solace, and for a time, each had assumed a place, discerned a way to live. indeed, they lived on, never to see each other again, both aware the one had harmed the other: whether intended or not, the act could not be undone. what they recalled, when they recalled, was often wrong, or was it that so much went wrong and that was why they kept recalling? at the mention of monaco, they recounted certain adornments — agapanthus purpling, old men playing boules, and blue yachts tilting on a malachite sea, or were they malachite yachts tilting on a blue sea? wherever they went henceforth — the hôtel du cap, the boboli gardens, or even simple, small places in america — their minds would inexorably turn, and then return, to that interval in monaco, where they saw the truth and the truth was . . . monaco, monaco — frivolous, ridiculous, miniscule principality. it was there they came to know how dangerous beauty could be, how one could disappear into it, and with that dark knowledge they traveled on. each, in their separate lives, always mentioned monaco with deference, out of shyness, yes, but also shame, and that need to abridge the past. do you recognize them? they were not a couple, but they were a pair. tonight the sea pushes against monaco. jewelry store owners don white gloves, lock their doors. the principality has long forgotten the pair. baronesses, marchionesses, and princesses have had their portraits painted and affixed to walls. the narrow, dead-end streets embed themselves into the escarpments like bobby pins. the moon spreads her cape of baubles across the sea with glamorous transience, enlarging behind the dollhouse casino, banks, hotels, feeling into the rooms, fingering the miniatures. <line>","relationships,men & women,social commentaries,cities & urban life"

11505,9786,"<line> <line>when the norn mother saw the whirlwind hour greatening and darkening as it hurried on, she left the heaven of heroes and came down to make a man to meet the mortal need. she took the tried clay of the common road— clay warm yet with the genial heat of earth, dashed through it all a strain of prophecy; tempered the heap with thrill of human tears; then mixed a laughter with the serious stuff. into the shape she breathed a flame to light that tender, tragic, ever-changing face. here was a man to hold against the world, a man to match the mountains and the sea. the color of the ground was in him, the red earth; the smack and tang of elemental things; the rectitude and patience of the cliff; the good-will of the rain that loves all leaves; the friendly welcome of the wayside well; the courage of the bird that dares the sea; the gladness of the wind that shakes the corn; the pity of the snow that hides all scars; the secrecy of streams that make their way beneath the mountain to the rifted rock; the tolerance and equity of light that gives as freely to the shrinking flower as to the great oak flaring to the wind— to the grave’s low hill as to the matterhorn that shoulders out the sky. sprung from the west, he drank the valorous youth of a new world. the strength of virgin forests braced his mind, the hush of spacious prairies stilled his soul. his words were oaks in acorns; and his thoughts were roots that firmly gripped the granite truth. up from log cabin to the capitol, one fire was on his spirit, one resolve— to send the keen ax to the root of wrong, clearing a free way for the feet of god, the eyes of conscience testing every stroke, to make his deed the measure of a man. he built the rail-pile as he built the state, pouring his splendid strength through every blow: the grip that swung the ax in illinois was on the pen that set a people free. so came the captain with the mighty heart; and when the judgment thunders split the house, wrenching the rafters from their ancient rest, he held the ridgepole up, and spiked again the rafters of the home. he held his place— held the long purpose like a growing tree— held on through blame and faltered not at praise. and when he fell in whirlwind, he went down as when a lordly cedar, green with boughs, goes down with a great shout upon the hills, and leaves a lonesome place against the sky. <line>","social commentaries,heroes & patriotism"

i need something to eat. do you have any chocolate?” opening the fridge, i said quietly and perhaps too seriously, trying to impress you: “the monster is that being who refuses to adapt to her circumstances.” her fate. her body. great britain. you said: “so, is laloo english or british?” i said: “she’s from london.” but the more i said london, the more it sounded like a joke. londonlondonlondon. <line> <line> <line> 2 i was thinking today about what happens when you keep going in a car. this is something you can only do here. wish for something. did you ever do it? wish you weren’t there? i want that go on, go even though it is unclear to me what happens when you get to the panama canal or idaho. hitchhiking in idaho as a veritable child, i was taken in by a farming couple, fatty and daddy, a hundred miles or so outside of boise. fatty was rail thin, about seventy-five, and daddy was a big man who had a reclining chair in each room and looked younger than his wife. they picked me up in their truck—i was sitting by the side of the road brushing the knots out of my hair with my fingers—and i stayed with them for five days. they said it was not the right thing for me to be in the open like that, and they took me to eat every day at a restaurant called country buffet. in my innocence, i had been walking on a road that led to the country compound of a kkk leader/operative, charles reynold. what is an operative? it is someone who is always planning a way in, like the hen-house fox with his beautifully red, bushy tail. daddy, fatty, and i hunkered down until daddy’s nephew, robert, stopped by on his way through nowhere and gave me a ride to boise proper, where there was a bus station. i waited until robert had gone and then i walked out to the main drag to get a cup of coffee and interview murderers. “i can take you as far as the state line.” “that would be lovely.” obsessed, far from home with its gooseberry patches and grim professions based upon openings at heathrow airport or nestle, the main employers in the dingy part of northwest london that constituted my origins, i said yes. soft yes to the color green, which is going. <line> <line> <line> 3 that is a tree (going) but also an ocean: a way of being saturated with color that only happens here in your country for me; for you it might happen in another place. mine. like laloo, i lived for many years on an island with congested traffic flows. thus, a juniper tree flying by the window, intensely blue, or the atlantic ocean, to the left, if the car has a destination to the south, such as to the keys, is magical to me. improbable in light of my origins. hers. the girl in the car. i don’t know. i am writing to you, in your special writing dress made from scraps of lace as if it (the dress, the morning of writing ahead of you) is a café; as if, writing, you are hypnotizing not only the biologies of strangers and friends but also yourself. for this reason, when i think of you reading, i think of you as writing blindly. you read but you are also writing. as if my own eyes were closed, i see your white books floating in the sky above my painting of the red girl. these books are separate from my own work, here in the salt-water notebook, but they communicate with it in a nonlocal sense. like birds. <line> <line> <line> 4 this is pre but the notebook is after. soaked already at the edge and foamy. past future. writing on the warp when dry. pages. entries by hand. that is the morning i woke up and walked to the pacific ocean, after a night in a motel in florence, oregon, complete with a dodgy door and the reality of pillows. the woman at the front desk was wearing a very pretty apron with purple and yellow flowers on it. an expatriate, she said exaggeratedly, oblivious to our common origin: “about four miles. you’re not going to walk, are you? do you have an umbrella? you can’t go out like that, ducky.” <line> <line> <line> 5 i walked towards the sound of something roaring in a day, the kind of day that is like darkness but lit up, on its forested, proximal verge by gorse, which is a bright yellow flower. citron-yellow and a kind of tin or silver roofing with holes in it. the day. like walking in a dreamed landscape drenched with the wrong rain. monsoon. what kind of rain is this? i recognized the immensity but not the temperature. this was monstrous: the inability to assimilate, on the level of the senses, an ordinary experience of weather. here is the tongue, for example, constantly darting out to feel the air: what is it? is it summer? is it a different season? it’s a different day. that’s okay. damaged from her travels, in some sense unsettled, enormously anxious, a girl does it anway: gets up and goes. it’s as if the day has a memory of her and not the other way around. <line>","life choices,activities,travels & journeys,relationships,nature,arts & sciences,social commentaries,popular culture"

11580,7122,"<line> <line>the year’s twelve daughters had in turn gone by, of measured pace tho’ varying mien all twelve, some froward, some sedater, some adorn’d for festival, some reckless of attire. the snow had left the mountain-top; fresh flowers had withered in the meadow; fig and prune hung wrinkling; the last apple glow’d amid its freckled leaves; and weary oxen blinkt between the trodden corn and twisted vine, under whose bunches stood the empty crate, to creak ere long beneath them carried home. this was the season when twelve months before, o gentle hamadryad, true to love! thy mansion, thy dim mansion in the wood was blasted and laid desolate: but none dared violate its precincts, none dared pluck the moss beneath it, which alone remain’d of what was thine. old thallinos sat mute in solitary sadness. the strange tale (not until rhaicos died, but then the whole) echion had related, whom no force could ever make look back upon the oaks. the father said “echion! thou must weigh, carefully, and with steady hand, enough (although no longer comes the store as once!) of wax to burn all day and night upon that hollow stone where milk and honey lie: so may the gods, so may the dead, be pleas’d!” thallinos bore it thither in the morn, and lighted it and left it. first of those who visited upon this solemn day the hamadryad’s oak, were rhodope and acon; of one age, one hope, one trust. graceful was she as was the nymph whose fate she sorrowed for: he slender, pale, and first lapt by the flame of love: his father’s lands were fertile, herds lowed over them afar. now stood the two aside the hollow stone and lookt with stedfast eyes toward the oak shivered and black and bare. “may never we love as they loved!” said acon. she at this smiled, for he said not what he meant to say, and thought not of its bliss, but of its end. he caught the flying smile, and blusht, and vow’d nor time nor other power, whereto the might of love hath yielded and may yield again, should alter his. the father of the youth wanted not beauty for him, wanted not song, that could lift earth’s weight from off his heart, discretion, that could guide him thro’ the world, innocence, that could clear his way to heaven; silver and gold and land, not green before the ancestral gate, but purple under skies bending far off, he wanted for his heir. fathers have given life, but virgin heart they never gave; and dare they then control or check it harshly?

this bank, where first i sate with him . . the faithful (now i know, too late!) the faithful rhaicos. haste thee home; be happy, if thou canst; but come no more where those whom death alone could sever, died.” he started up: the moss whereon he slept was dried and withered: deadlier paleness spread over his cheek; he sickened: and the sire had land enough; it held his only son. <line>","relationships,family & ancestors,nature,landscapes & pastorals,mythology & folklore,greek & roman mythology,heroes & patriotism"

all things have rest: why should we toil alone, we only toil, who are the first of things, and make perpetual moan, still from one sorrow to another thrown: nor ever fold our wings, and cease from wanderings, nor steep our brows in slumber's holy balm; nor harken what the inner spirit sings, ""there is no joy but calm!"" why should we only toil, the roof and crown of things? iii lo! in the middle of the wood, the folded leaf is woo'd from out the bud with winds upon the branch, and there grows green and broad, and takes no care, sun-steep'd at noon, and in the moon nightly dew-fed; and turning yellow falls, and floats adown the air. lo! sweeten'd with the summer light, the full-juiced apple, waxing over-mellow, drops in a silent autumn night. all its allotted length of days the flower ripens in its place, ripens and fades, and falls, and hath no toil, fast-rooted in the fruitful soil. iv hateful is the dark-blue sky, vaulted o'er the dark-blue sea. death is the end of life; ah, why should life all labour be? let us alone. time driveth onward fast, and in a little while our lips are dumb. let us alone. what is it that will last? all things are taken from us, and become portions and parcels of the dreadful past. let us alone. what pleasure can we have to war with evil? is there any peace in ever climbing up the climbing wave? all things have rest, and ripen toward the grave in silence; ripen, fall and cease: give us long rest or death, dark death, or dreamful ease. v how sweet it were, hearing the downward stream, with half-shut eyes ever to seem falling asleep in a half-dream! to dream and dream, like yonder amber light, which will not leave the myrrh-bush on the height; to hear each other's whisper'd speech; eating the lotos day by day, to watch the crisping ripples on the beach, and tender curving lines of creamy spray; to lend our hearts and spirits wholly to the influence of mild-minded melancholy; to muse and brood and live again in memory, with those old faces of our infancy heap'd over with a mound of grass, two handfuls of white dust, shut in an urn of brass! vi dear is the memory of our wedded lives, and dear the last embraces of our wives and their warm tears: but all hath suffer'd change: for surely now our household hearths are cold, our sons inherit us: our looks are strange: and we should come like ghosts to trouble joy. or else the island princes over-bold have eat our substance, and the minstrel sings before them of the ten years' war in troy, and our great deeds, as half-forgotten things. is there confusion in the little isle? let what is broken so remain. the gods are hard to reconcile: 'tis hard to settle order once again. there is confusion worse than death, trouble on trouble, pain on pain, long labour unto aged breath, sore task to hearts worn out by many wars and eyes grown dim with gazing on the pilot-stars. vii but, propt on beds of amaranth and moly, how sweet (while warm airs lull us, blowing lowly) with half-dropt eyelid still, beneath a heaven dark and holy, to watch the long bright river drawing slowly his waters from the purple hill— to hear the dewy echoes calling from cave to cave thro' the thick-twined vine— to watch the emerald-colour'd water falling thro' many a wov'n acanthus-wreath divine! only to hear and see the far-off sparkling brine, only to hear were sweet, stretch'd out beneath the pine. viii the lotos blooms below the barren peak: the lotos blows by every winding creek: all day the wind breathes low with mellower tone: thro' every hollow cave and alley lone round and round the spicy downs the yellow lotos-dust is blown. we have had enough of action, and of motion we, roll'd to starboard, roll'd to larboard, when the surge was seething free, where the wallowing monster spouted his foam-fountains in the sea. let us swear an oath, and keep it with an equal mind, in the hollow lotos-land to live and lie reclined on the hills like gods together, careless of mankind. for they lie beside their nectar, and the bolts are hurl'd far below them in the valleys, and the clouds are lightly curl'd round their golden houses, girdled with the gleaming world: where they smile in secret, looking over wasted lands, blight and famine, plague and earthquake, roaring deeps and fiery sands, clanging fights, and flaming towns, and sinking ships, and praying hands. but they smile, they find a music centred in a doleful song steaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong, like a tale of little meaning tho' the words are strong; chanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave the soil, sow the seed, and reap the harvest with enduring toil, storing yearly little dues of wheat, and wine and oil; till they perish and they suffer—some, 'tis whisper'd—down in hell suffer endless anguish, others in elysian valleys dwell, resting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel. surely, surely, slumber is more sweet than toil, the shore than labour in the deep mid-ocean, wind and wave and oar; o, rest ye, brother mariners, we will not wander more. <line>","living,time & brevity,mythology & folklore"

when soft the western breezes blow, and strolling youths meet sauntering maids, i love to watch the stirring trades beneath the vallombrosa shades our much-enduring elms bestow; the vender and his rhetoric’s flow, that lambent stream of liquid lies; the bait he dangles from his line, the gudgeon and his gold-washed prize. i halt before the blazoned sign that bids me linger to admire the drama time can never tire, the little hero of the hunch, with iron arm and soul of fire, and will that works his fierce desire,— untamed, unscared, unconquered punch! my ear a pleasing torture finds in tones the withered sibyl grinds,— the dame sans merci’s broken strain, whom i erewhile, perchance, have known, when orleans filled the bourbon throne, a siren singing by the seine. but most i love the tube that spies the orbs celestial in their march; that shows the comet as it whisks its tail across the planets’ disks, as if to blind their blood-shot eyes; or wheels so close against the sun we tremble at the thought of risks our little spinning ball may run, to pop like corn that children parch, from summer something overdone, and roll, a cinder, through the skies. grudge not to-day the scanty fee to him who farms the firmament, to whom the milky way is free; who holds the wondrous crystal key, the silent open sesame that science to her sons has lent; who takes his toll, and lifts the bar that shuts the road to sun and star. if venus only comes to time, (and prophets say she must and shall,) to-day will hear the tinkling chime of many a ringing silver dime, for him whose optic glass supplies the crowd with astronomic eyes,— the galileo of the mall. dimly the transit morning broke; the sun seemed doubting what to do, as one who questions how to dress, and takes his doublets from the press, and halts between the old and new. please heaven he wear his suit of blue, or don, at least, his ragged cloak, with rents that show the azure through! i go the patient crowd to join that round the tube my eyes discern, the last new-comer of the file, and wait, and wait, a weary while, and gape, and stretch, and shrug, and smile, (for each his place must fairly earn, hindmost and foremost, in his turn,) till hitching onward, pace by pace, i gain at last the envied place, and pay the white exiguous coin: the sun and i are face to face; he glares at me, i stare at him; and lo! my straining eye has found a little spot that, black and round, lies near the crimsoned fire-orb’s rim. o blessed, beauteous evening star, well named for her whom earth adores,— the lady of the dove-drawn car,— i know thee in thy white simar; but veiled in black, a rayless spot, blank as a careless scribbler’s blot, stripped of thy robe of silvery flame,— the stolen robe that night restores when day has shut his golden doors,— i see thee, yet i know thee not; and canst thou call thyself the same? a black, round spot,—and that is all; and such a speck our earth would be if he who looks upon the stars through the red atmosphere of mars could see our little creeping ball across the disk of crimson crawl as i our sister planet see. and art thou, then, a world like ours, flung from the orb that whirled our own a molten pebble from its zone? how must thy burning sands absorb the fire-waves of the blazing orb, thy chain so short, thy path so near, thy flame-defying creatures hear the maelstroms of the photosphere! and is thy bosom decked with flowers that steal their bloom from scalding showers? and hast thou cities, domes, and towers, and life, and love that makes it dear, and death that fills thy tribes with fear? lost in my dream, my spirit soars through paths the wandering angels know; my all-pervading thought explores the azure ocean’s lucent shores; i leave my mortal self below, as up the star-lit stairs i climb, and still the widening view reveals in endless rounds the circling wheels that build the horologe of time. new spheres, new suns, new systems gleam; the voice no earth-born echo hears steals softly on my ravished ears: i hear them “singing as they shine”— a mortal’s voice dissolves my dream: my patient neighbor, next in line, hints gently there are those who wait. o guardian of the starry gate, what coin shall pay this debt of mine? too slight thy claim, too small the fee that bids thee turn the potent key the tuscan’s hand has placed in thine. forgive my own the small affront, the insult of the proffered dime; take it, o friend, since this thy wont, but still shall faithful memory be a bankrupt debtor unto thee, and pay thee with a grateful rhyme. <line>","nature,stars, planets, heavens,arts & sciences,sciences,social commentaries,cities & urban life"

two candles in translucent, white-waxed sacks, <line> <line>and a polychrome madonna with meeting brows. <line> <line>through your window, car wheels, railings; and, above, <line> <line>my own second-story windows. “we saw you <line> <line>reading there,” you said from behind me, “when we moved in.” <line> <line>you sat me on the sofa, and formally presented your daughter <line> <line>(she moved her schoolbooks all to one end.) near her, a shallow, <line> <line>linoleumed-over trench and a bathroom sink. you said: <line> <line>“i’m a widow from the mountains near morache, very near <line> <line>the home-town of señora luz. my real work is hotel maid, and i’ve got <line> <line>a nice job, at a place called the tricontinental.” <line> <line>then you paused, and i felt how clearly <line> <line>you’d presented yourself, as americans do, with your job, <line> <line>your état civil, and i said: “i’m a graduate student <line> <line>at nyu, where luz studies, no, not married, no children ...” <line> <line>i tried to add something else at once, to leave this less ... <line> <line>definitive, but nothing came, so we ran through bridge-rumors, <line> <line>and soon we were hardly listening, waiting <line> <line>for our own next word, and laughing at our gabble. pequita <line> <line>told us what the priest had said <line> <line>about the drilling; you spoke of pequita’s <line> <line>first communion, and none of us could stop <line> <line>finding striking things to say. next day you came over <line> <line>to see my plants, and i came back for soup-supper, looking up <line> <line>at my windows, which in the easy half-yellow light <line> <line>of autumn looked oddly beckoning. as we ate, <line> <line>you leaned forward, with a sudden rogue’s smile, <line> <line>and mockingly proposed that we three walk across the bridge, <line> <line>“there’s a path up there. if the bridge <line> <line>is bad, we’ll tell off the mayor—” (in what spirit, i wondered, <line> <line>had you listened to our committee?) and when i got home <line> <line>i looked down, and through your sheer curtains saw you <line> <line>cleaning up, and pequita, at the table, reading.iv <line> <line>but next week, instead of the plank stair <line> <line>that zigzags up the anchorage-side, we wandered <line> <line>the riverside shipping alleys. from below, we could see <line> <line>overhead the under-arch of the bridge, and feel <line> <line>the resonant top-thrum of westbound <line> <line>subways and trucks. then the riverside—i loved <line> <line>this part. a sort of post-industrial fenworld, with tiny <line> <line>terrace houses, big dredger-parts laid aside <line> <line>from the drillings, and abandoned wreckers’ lots <line> <line>filled with sea-floor light and trembling, long-awned <line> <line>panicles of switchgrass. its timelessness <line> <line>soothed me—though ephemeral. even that day, one freshly <line> <line>tuckpointed facade, and a pair of brandnew bronze <line> <line>edwardian mermaid doorknockers. i could see <line> <line>our quarter five years from now, say—the withering <line> <line>discount chains, tentative boutiques, <line> <line>and mother and daughter figuring, to the upscale <line> <line>“pioneers,” as neighborhood indigenes, living on <line> <line>with strange literalness among them, supplying <line> <line>their just-permissible quantum of urban grit. <line> <line>you were ahead, and pequita trailed us, rattling weed stalks <line> <line>with a stray lath. as we progressed in and out <line> <line>of the endspan’s slatted shadows, you turned <line> <line>and called me into a side-lot—sunken concrete, flask- <line> <line>green puddles, to a broken-off building wall. it had been <line> <line>interior, once—rows of soiled roomsized <line> <line>plaster squares trailing sawn pipes, with one high trembling <line> <line>toilet, like a pearl. in a lower square, fringed <line> <line>with ailanthus and barbs of gang graffiti, <line> <line>was a mural. muy latino: the mountain <line> <line>dreaming the city: a terrace cafe with palm trees <line> <line>and a dancer shawled in black lace, with inward-angled <line> <line>castanets. and you lifted yourself on tiptoe, <line> <line>pilar, to touch the lace, as you might have grazed <line> <line>pequita’s cheek. i felt a pang, as if i already needed you <line> <line>sturdy inside your sturdy body, not this gesture <line> <line>as if, exiled within, you reached out— we stepped <line> <line>back, museum-wise, to contemplate, and you said: <line> <line>“luz likes to say i’m some mountain-woman, but when <line> <line>my mother died, i lived with my aunt in the city—i only <line> <line>went back when i married.” i told her i’d lived <line> <line>in this city, with a stepmother, who’d divorced my uncle <line> <line>to marry my father; and beat me. “a stepmother’s <line> <line>a curse of god,” you said gently. and on the walk back, <line> <line>pointed out more wall palms, beaches, until new york <line> <line>seemed a dot in a belt of capitals <line> <line>high on the globe: world-cities, packed <line> <line>with immigrants, refugees, gastarbeiter: a snowy <line> <line>latitude suffused with tropical nostalgia.v <line> <line>we were a threesome. coffee, suppers, tv, <line> <line>pequita at my computer—you’d asked me to teach her— <line> <line>or sleeping on my sofa, one bad month <line> <line>they moved you to night shift. yet only that summer, <line> <line>i’d worked in my window like a scholar <line> <line>in a lamplit bay, the night filled with myriad noises, <line> <line>like roman juvenal, to whose ears “came ever <line> <line>the sounds of buildings collapsing.” across, the two <line> <line>tenement-faces, florid, all bucrania, meanders, dusky trails <line> <line>of fire-escape bedding. and everything underlit <line> <line>by the sinister, slow-stopping car lights of our street. <line> <line>but now it was the dailiness of two <line> <line>from another hemisphere. through snow-fissures, winds fluting <line> <line>on railings and building-flaws, pilar in her low frame <line> <line>paced with armfuls of laundry, washed <line> <line>in the sink and hung to dry everywhere. the thousand <line> <line>stratagems of those who simply must not spend; <line> <line>and the tiny mother-decisions: though you preferred <line> <line>periphery, housekeeping around her, <line> <line>you’d make yourself interrupt her, to mop <line> <line>behind your sweeping. and pequita—i saw her wrap <line> <line>you up on the sofa when you had flu, and bring you <line> <line>orange juice, as they’d taught her in school, for she <line> <line>loved you, she was the person who loved you— <line> <line>i saw too, that of what i wanted the university <line> <line>to be for me—a tiny model of the city <line> <line>with its own rules and subsets: “tell me <line> <line>each day who i am”—you’d found your part <line> <line>in pequita; i followed the shape <line> <line>of your day touching center as it funneled <line> <line>into her hand and moving pencil-point.vi <line> <line>for everything seemed natural to pequita: <line> <line>the credo, her photocopied choir music <line> <line>piled beside the tidy prie-dieu, <line> <line>our neighborhood of syringe-filled gutters, drug-stoops and pimps, <line> <line>her school’s turkey cutouts, metal detectors, backed-up toilets ... <line> <line>our human wilderness, half-urban, half-surreal <line> <line>to her was a matter-of-fact eden, like the picturesque ruins <line> <line>and laughably rococo grottoes imagined <line> <line>by the seicento as the golden age. <line> <line>—and i, i thought her whole world, it comes back— <line> <line>touching, as if her child’s paradisial will were there <line> <line>for my affectionate recreation, like our still faithfully, <line> <line>occasionally, typed-up and dispatched <line> <line>protests from the ramp committee to the mayor. slight effects <line> <line>of perspective, tiny human gestures <line> <line>giving point to the city’s vast, ironic beauty.part twovii <line> <line>at a moment when no one was thinking <line> <line>about her, pequita awoke. perhaps <line> <line>she enjoyed the solitude, pilar asleep, <line> <line>me asleep across the street. she got up <line> <line>and stood on the cheap oval bathroom rug <line> <line>before the sink. at seven the drills started, <line> <line>deeper-toned than ever before (they woke me)— <line> <line>and part of your ceiling fell in; a beam <line> <line>splintered, plummeting straight to the oval rug— <line> <line>the person screaming over the phone <line> <line>was pilar. i thought it must be really <line> <line>all right, or she’d be crying not screaming, <line> <line>but when i’d called 911 and run over, pequita <line> <line>was barely alive. <line> <line>then the hospital corridors, <line> <line>me trying to close my winter coat <line> <line>(the buttons were off) on my nightgown, you <line> <line>on a bench, staring straight ahead. <line> <line>when they said pequita was <line> <line>“gone,” you were utterly silent. i brought you <line> <line>to my place (though our street was a tangle <line> <line>of police lights and yellow tape), terrified <line> <line>of your fixed inner focus, as if you had <line> <line>a plan ... next night i had luz stay over, <line> <line>i slept at her place; the third i was back. you, <line> <line>thank god (i thought), were crying, and luz <line> <line>had set up the service. she propelled us downstairs <line> <line>and to a tiny brick church i must often have passed <line> <line>without seeing it, two blocks inland. <line> <line>egg-blue inside, it was, with a little green <line> <line>and gilt altar, dark stations on the walls, <line> <line>and the statue of the virgin of guadeloupe <line> <line>placed oddly below the altar stairs, so that pilar, <line> <line>after the death-mass, could kneel <line> <line>before her, praying straight into her face, <line> <line>while i on a kneeler buried mine in my hands. <line> <line>what would the mother live for now, the hotel, me, or luz, <line> <line>already writing more endless mad letters? yet only these <line> <line>had from the city real answers: they’d brace the drill site <line> <line>with vibration-absorbing piers; and they wanted <line> <line>her and her friend mrs. citrin to know <line> <line>“that no one else had been more than lightly injured.”viii <line> <line>it was the end of winter, very dark. the building <line> <line>managers, nervy, had moved you to the first floor <line> <line>next door, till you found a new place (i knew <line> <line>you weren’t looking). each day i saw you <line> <line>arrive from work, answer my call tersely, <line> <line>then pull down your blinds. a shadow showed rarely, <line> <line>flattened, shapeless; you lay on your sofa a lot. <line> <line>“thanks anne—i’m better without company,” or <line> <line>“please understand.” but often, later <line> <line>in the evening, you’d come down the stairs <line> <line>and turn inland. then, one morning as i was passing <line> <line>with early groceries, you were leaving the parish hall <line> <line>in your black winter coat, heavily scarved, <line> <line>and we paused. approvingly, you tapped one glove <line> <line>on my armload—you’d told me to cook more, dictated <line> <line>recipes. i asked if this had been pequita’s <line> <line>choir-practice place; the sentence wavered, <line> <line>but you replied with grim joy, <line> <line>“she’s not practicing now.” it took me a minute. <line> <line>pequita was singing, this moment, in the presence. <line> <line>still what you felt most (it was in your face) <line> <line>was absence, absence, but from something bitter <line> <line>in your eyes, that seemed small and round with the cold, i felt <line> <line>your desire to exclude me and our old collusive ironies. <line> <line>what were such luxuries now, ironies, anglo friends; <line> <line>and i thought you hated my mind <line> <line>that remembered the brownpapered books, <line> <line>the orange juice. i reached to touch your arm—to get past <line> <line>this, but no, you had to get home: <line> <line>“i fasted for communion”; and your eyes <line> <line>swerved away. all my laughable, <line> <line>my lovely, delusional studies, that i’d seen you <line> <line>sort through for pequita, were now an affront. and yet <line> <line>i felt you moving behind your own mind, as if <line> <line>with something held in reserve ...ix <line> <line>but then you stopped answering the phone, went <line> <line>less often to church. what i thought <line> <line>was that you were angry (certainly i was). perhaps <line> <line>i thought you needed to talk, and i’d visit you <line> <line>in manhattan. so one morning in march, <line> <line>in the black coat i’d got for the funeral, i walked east <line> <line>from the forty-second street lexington stop <line> <line>to the three-story, fairy-lit jungle atrium <line> <line>of the tricontinental, and went to the seventh floor, <line> <line>where you started. there was a cart in the hall, <line> <line>a gleaming chrome maid’s cart half-projecting <line> <line>from a bedroom. on its sides were rows <line> <line>of glasses with lace sani-bonnets, gold- <line> <line>stamped mini-soaps and deodorants. it moved out, <line> <line>and you stood in the door with a sheet-load, looking fat <line> <line>in a starchy pink uniform monogrammedpilar. when you saw me, you dropped the sheets <line> <line>and in pain, pressed both palms to your cheeks, <line> <line>and looked at me looking at you. when <line> <line>i started sobbing, you took my shoulder and backed me <line> <line>to the elevator. pressed the button, stepped back, <line> <line>and then, to my surprise, gave me a sudden hug <line> <line>before pushing me in.x <line> <line>it had been always this half-connected <line> <line>and tenuous, our friendship. what light on my own <line> <line>isolation and need, that i hadn’t known. <line> <line>but you actually called me, that week, to propose <line> <line>our old joke, a bridge walk—maybe saturday? <line> <line>your voice in my ears sounded wobbly <line> <line>with tension, held-backness, so i got in first: <line> <line>a friend had wound up her doctorate and left me <line> <line>a minute village studio starting june ... after that <line> <line>i could listen, somber, as you poured out <line> <line>your need to leave, luz’s cousin, the possible <line> <line>hotel job “right in la.” you added “anne,” and broke off. <line> <line>“well, i’ll tell you that later. look, it may <line> <line>snow on saturday, ok?” “i don’t care.” and before <line> <line>you hung up, i’d resigned you, <line> <line>given you up. we’d part, on my side <line> <line>in anger, on yours in oblivion. i met you <line> <line>at the foot of the anchorage stair <line> <line>(not the eastern approach, with its easy grade <line> <line>near the ramp site). we climbed through the snow, <line> <line>slowly, pausing at landings for different <line> <line>views of our old alley world. like a museum <line> <line>of disused urban functions—we noted a bricked-over <line> <line>backyard privy arch, and from higher, roof-huts, inkily distinct, <line> <line>of old-style tenement dumbwaiters. the whole scene <line> <line>thrown out of drawing by one of those giant <line> <line>nyc cable-spools, charred at the bottom <line> <line>where some homeless had tried to burn it. <line> <line>the moist snow was sweeping <line> <line>through the cable tower when we clambered <line> <line>onto the path beneath it. as we moved, hunched slightly, <line> <line>onto the mainspan, the whole city abruptly <line> <line>whited-out to a monochrome geometry <line> <line>of vertical and stooping gray lines. i thought <line> <line>how pequita would have loved it, and caught <line> <line>her mother’s eye. we went on cautiously, soon <line> <line>pausing to stamp our boots and look over the rail <line> <line>at the traffic lanes below us. “anne, what <line> <line>i started to say before—this is it: i’m sorry <line> <line>i didn’t talk to you—you understand?” “of course,” <line> <line>i lied aimlessly. but you, glancing sideways, <line> <line>“but i’m really sorry ...” “no, really ...” you shook <line> <line>your head slightly, then took my arm. “okay then— <line> <line>what’s this thing?” pointing a snowy boot <line> <line>at a bolt as high as our knees, with a rusted-on octagonal <line> <line>nut: “it’s just a bolt.” you tapped your glove on a strut— <line> <line>“strut,” i provided. and you said, pompously, in luz’ very <line> <line>intonations (in what spirit had you <line> <line>listened?)—“the tolerances just aren’t there.” <line> <line>then, feeling easier, we started naming everything— <line> <line>spikes, spun-wire vertical cables: english, <line> <line>spanish, and then i heard you speak quiché (words once <line> <line>for vines, for split trunks <line> <line>over gorges?) but everything on the bridge was <line> <line>shabby, neglected-looking; and you said <line> <line>soberly: “if anyone was supposed <line> <line>to look after this bridge, he’s forgot all about it.” <line> <line>we didn’t link arms again, but started back, pausing <line> <line>to throw a few loose snowballs <line> <line>on the manhattan traffic below us. we’d go <line> <line>our separate ways—i’d go on delaying, skirting <line> <line>around my burnt-out places;

frets doubt the maw-crammed beast? rejoice we are allied to that which doth provide and not partake, effect and not receive! a spark disturbs our clod; nearer we hold of god who gives, than of his tribes that take, i must believe. then, welcome each rebuff that turns earth's smoothness rough, each sting that bids nor sit nor stand but go! be our joys three-parts pain! strive, and hold cheap the strain; learn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe! for thence,—a paradox which comforts while it mocks,— shall life succeed in that it seems to fail: what i aspired to be, and was not, comforts me: a brute i might have been, but would not sink i' the scale. what is he but a brute whose flesh has soul to suit, whose spirit works lest arms and legs want play?

'twas heavy then to hear thy voice of moan, but this is worse, that thou art speechless grown. thou hast forgot thy name thou hadst; thou wast nothing but she, and her thou hast o'erpast. for, as a child kept from the font until a prince, expected long, come to fulfill the ceremonies, thou unnam'd had'st laid, had not her coming, thee her palace made; her name defin'd thee, gave thee form, and frame, and thou forget'st to celebrate thy name. some months she hath been dead (but being dead, measures of times are all determined) but long she'ath been away, long, long, yet none offers to tell us who it is that's gone. but as in states doubtful of future heirs, when sickness without remedy impairs the present prince, they're loath it should be said, ""the prince doth languish,"" or ""the prince is dead;"" so mankind feeling now a general thaw, a strong example gone, equal to law, the cement which did faithfully compact and glue all virtues, now resolv'd, and slack'd, thought it some blasphemy to say sh'was dead, or that our weakness was discovered in that confession; therefore spoke no more than tongues, the soul being gone, the loss deplore. but though it be too late to succour thee, sick world, yea dead, yea putrified, since she thy' intrinsic balm, and thy preservative, can never be renew'd, thou never live, i (since no man can make thee live) will try, what we may gain by thy anatomy. her death hath taught us dearly that thou art corrupt and mortal in thy purest part. let no man say, the world itself being dead, 'tis labour lost to have discovered the world's infirmities, since there is none alive to study this dissection; for there's a kind of world remaining still, though she which did inanimate and fill the world, be gone, yet in this last long night, her ghost doth walk; that is a glimmering light, a faint weak love of virtue, and of good, reflects from her on them which understood her worth; and though she have shut in all day, the twilight of her memory doth stay, which, from the carcass of the old world free, creates a new world, and new creatures be produc'd. the matter and the stuff of this, her virtue, and the form our practice is. and though to be thus elemented, arm these creatures from home-born intrinsic harm, (for all assum'd unto this dignity so many weedless paradises be, which of themselves produce no venomous sin, except some foreign serpent bring it in) yet, because outward storms the strongest break, and strength itself by confidence grows weak, this new world may be safer, being told the dangers and diseases of the old; for with due temper men do then forgo, or covet things, when they their true worth know. there is no health; physicians say that we at best enjoy but a neutrality. and can there be worse sickness than to know that we are never well, nor can be so? we are born ruinous: poor mothers cry that children come not right, nor orderly; except they headlong come and fall upon an ominous precipitation. how witty's ruin! how importunate upon mankind! it labour'd to frustrate even god's purpose; and made woman, sent for man's relief, cause of his languishment. they were to good ends, and they are so still, but accessory, and principal in ill, for that first marriage was our funeral; one woman at one blow, then kill'd us all, and singly, one by one, they kill us now. we do delightfully our selves allow to that consumption; and profusely blind, we kill our selves to propagate our kind. and yet we do not that; we are not men; there is not now that mankind, which was then, when as the sun and man did seem to strive, (joint tenants of the world) who should survive; when stag, and raven, and the long-liv'd tree, compar'd with man, died in minority; when, if a slow-pac'd star had stol'n away from the observer's marking, he might stay two or three hundred years to see't again, and then make up his observation plain; when, as the age was long, the size was great (man's growth confess'd, and recompens'd the meat), so spacious and large, that every soul did a fair kingdom, and large realm control; and when the very stature, thus erect, did that soul a good way towards heaven direct. where is this mankind now? who lives to age, fit to be made methusalem his page? alas, we scarce live long enough to try whether a true-made clock run right, or lie. old grandsires talk of yesterday with sorrow, and for our children we reserve tomorrow. so short is life, that every peasant strives, in a torn house, or field, to have three lives. and as in lasting, so in length is man contracted to an inch, who was a span; for had a man at first in forests stray'd, or shipwrack'd in the sea, one would have laid a wager, that an elephant, or whale, that met him, would not hastily assail a thing so equall to him; now alas, the fairies, and the pigmies well may pass as credible; mankind decays so soon, we'are scarce our fathers' shadows cast at noon, only death adds t'our length: nor are we grown in stature to be men, till we are none. but this were light, did our less volume hold all the old text; or had we chang'd to gold their silver; or dispos'd into less glass spirits of virtue, which then scatter'd was. but 'tis not so; w'are not retir'd, but damp'd; and as our bodies, so our minds are cramp'd; 'tis shrinking, not close weaving, that hath thus in mind and body both bedwarfed us. we seem ambitious, god's whole work t'undo; of nothing he made us, and we strive too, to bring our selves to nothing back; and we do what we can, to do't so soon as he. with new diseases on our selves we war, and with new physic, a worse engine far. thus man, this world's vice-emperor, in whom all faculties, all graces are at home (and if in other creatures they appear, they're but man's ministers and legates there to work on their rebellions, and reduce them to civility, and to man's use); this man, whom god did woo, and loath t'attend till man came up, did down to man descend, this man, so great, that all that is, is his, o what a trifle, and poor thing he is! if man were anything, he's nothing now; help, or at least some time to waste, allow t'his other wants, yet when he did depart with her whom we lament, he lost his heart. she, of whom th'ancients seem'd to prophesy, when they call'd virtues by the name of she; she in whom virtue was so much refin'd, that for alloy unto so pure a mind she took the weaker sex; she that could drive the poisonous tincture, and the stain of eve, out of her thoughts, and deeds, and purify all, by a true religious alchemy, she, she is dead; she's dead: when thou knowest this, thou knowest how poor a trifling thing man is, and learn'st thus much by our anatomy, the heart being perish'd, no part can be free, and that except thou feed (not banquet) on the supernatural food, religion, thy better growth grows withered, and scant; be more than man, or thou'rt less than an ant. then, as mankind, so is the world's whole frame quite out of joint, almost created lame, for, before god had made up all the rest, corruption ent'red, and deprav'd the best; it seiz'd the angels, and then first of all the world did in her cradle take a fall, and turn'd her brains, and took a general maim, wronging each joint of th'universal frame. the noblest part, man, felt it first; and then both beasts and plants, curs'd in the curse of man. so did the world from the first hour decay, that evening was beginning of the day, and now the springs and summers which we see, like sons of women after fifty be. and new philosophy calls all in doubt, the element of fire is quite put out, the sun is lost, and th'earth, and no man's wit can well direct him where to look for it. and freely men confess that this world's spent, when in the planets and the firmament they seek so many new; they see that this is crumbled out again to his atomies. 'tis all in pieces, all coherence gone, all just supply, and all relation; prince, subject, father, son, are things forgot, for every man alone thinks he hath got to be a phoenix, and that then can be none of that kind, of which he is, but he. this is the world's condition now, and now she that should all parts to reunion bow, she that had all magnetic force alone, to draw, and fasten sund'red parts in one; she whom wise nature had invented then when she observ'd that every sort of men did in their voyage in this world's sea stray, and needed a new compass for their way; she that was best and first original of all fair copies, and the general steward to fate; she whose rich eyes and breast gilt the west indies, and perfum'd the east; whose having breath'd in this world, did bestow spice on those isles, and bade them still smell so, and that rich india which doth gold inter, is but as single money, coin'd from her; she to whom this world must it self refer, as suburbs or the microcosm of her, she, she is dead; she's dead: when thou know'st this, thou know'st how lame a cripple this world is <line>","living,death,disappointment & failure,sorrow & grieving,time & brevity,relationships,men & women,religion,christianity,faith & doubt,god & the divine,arts & sciences,philosophy,social commentaries,gender & sexuality,history & politics,war & conflict"

the beam of the flashlight. <line> <line>he was climbing a tree beside the house, trying to get onto the porch, i think, for a wad of oatmeal <line> <line>simmered in cider from the bottom of the pan we'd left out for the birds. <line> <line>and earlier a burnished, somewhat dazed woodchuck, his coat gleaming with spring, <line> <line>loping toward his burrow in the roots of a tree among the drying winter's litter <line> <line>of old leaves on the floor of the woods, when i went out to get the new york times. <line> <line>and male cardinals whistling back and forth—sireeep, sreeep, sreeep— <line> <line>sets of three sweet full notes, weaving into and out of each other like the triplet rhymes in medieval poetry, <line> <line>and the higher, purer notes of the tufted titmice among them, <line> <line>high in the trees where they were catching what they could of the early sun. <line> <line>and a doe and two yearlings, picking their way along the worrying path they'd made through the gully, their coats the color of the forest floor, <line> <line>stopped just at the roots of the great chestnut where the woodchuck's burrow was, <line> <line>froze, and the doe looked back over her shoulder at me for a long moment, and leapt forward, <line> <line>her young following, and bounded with that almost mincing precision in the landing of each hoof <line> <line>up the gully, over it, and out of sight. so that i remembered <line> <line>dreaming last night that a deer walked into the house while i was writing at the kitchen table, <line> <line>came in the glass door from the garden, looked at me with a stilled defiant terror, like a thing with no choices, <line> <line>and, neck bobbing in that fragile-seeming, almost mechanical mix of arrest and liquid motion, came to the table <line> <line>and snatched a slice of apple, and stood, and then quietened, and to my surprise did not leave again. <line> <line>and those little captains, the chickadees, swift to the feeder and swift away. <line> <line>and the squirrels with their smoke-plume tails trailing digging in the leaves to bury or find buried— <line> <line>i'm told they don't remember where they put things, that it's an activity of incessant discovery— <line> <line>nuts, tree-fall proteins, whatever they forage from around the house of our leavings, <line> <line>and the flameheaded woodpecker at the suet with his black-and-white ladderback elegant fierceness— <line> <line>they take sunflower seeds and stash them in the rough ridges of the tree's bark <line> <line>where the beaks of the smoke-and-steel blue nuthatches can't quite get at them— <line> <line>though the nuthatches sometimes seem to get them as they con the trees methodically for spiders' eggs or some other overwintering insect's intricately packaged lump of futurity <line> <line>got from its body before the cold came on. <line> <line>and the little bat in the kitchen lightwell— <line> <line>when i climbed on a chair to remove the sheet of wimpled plastic and let it loose, <line> <line>it flew straight into my face and i toppled to the floor, chair under me, <line> <line>and it flared down the hall and did what seemed a frantic

ringtail curled and flared to make him look bigger and not to be messed with— <line> <line>i was thinking he couldn't know how charming his comic-book robber's mask was to me, <line> <line>that his

11833,3195,"<line> <line>the brent geese fly in long low wavering lines on their migrations. <line> <line>they start in western europe, fatten in iceland, then fly over the <line> <line>greenland ice cap to canada. they sometimes breed on the arctic <line> <line>coasts of central and western siberia and winter in western europe, <line> <line>some in england, the rest in germany and france. what i have to <line> <line>offer here is nothing revolutionary. they learn the map from their <line> <line>parents, or through culture rather than through genetics. it is just an <line> <line>observation, a small observation that sometimes art can hold the oil <line> <line>wars and all that they mean and might yet mean within. just as <line> <line>sometimes there are seven stanzas in a song. and just as sometimes <line> <line>there is a refrain between each stanza. and just as often this sort of <line> <line>song tells a certain sort of story, one about having something and then <line> <line>losing it. just as sometimes the refrain of a song is just one word said <line> <line>four times. just as sometimes the word is huge, sometimes coming <line> <line>from a machine and yet hitting in the heart; uplifting and ironic and <line> <line>big enough to hold all these things in its four syllables. just as some- <line> <line>times, often even, it contradicts, and thus works with, the stanzas. just <line> <line>as the police clear out yet another public space and yet another camera <line> <line>follows along behind. just as the stream has no narration, only ambient <line> <line>noise. and the police move slowly, methodically in a line as if they are <line> <line>a many-legged machine. they know what they are doing. it is their <line> <line>third time clearing the park and they will clear it many more times and <line> <line>then they will win and a building will be built where there once was <line> <line>the park. in this song, as is true of many songs, it is unclear why the <line> <line>singer has lost something, maybe someone. in this time, the time of <line> <line>the oil wars, there are many reasons that singers give for being so lost. <line> <line>often they are lost because of love. sometimes they are lost because of <line> <line>drugs. sometimes they have lost their country and in their heart it feels <line> <line>as if they have lost something big. and then sometimes they are lost <line> <line>just because they are in bakersfield. really though they are lost <line> <line>because in this time song holds loss. and this time is a time of loss. <line> <line>the police know, as they move through the park yet one more time, <line> <line>that they will win and a building will be built on the space. but right <line> <line>now, the building is not there. all that is there are the police and <line> <line>debris and the police deal with the debris. they push over book- <line> <line>shelves, open up boxes and look inside, tear into tents, awkwardly, the <line> <line>poles springing. they are only there to see if any humans remain. <line> <line>tomorrow the bulldozers will push the debris into big piles and load it <line> <line>into trucks. the police wear white helmets and short sleeves under <line> <line>their kevlar vests. for many years the brent geese ate eelgrass, but once <line> <line>the eelgrass was gone to the wasting disease and the estuaries filled, <line> <line>they moved inland to agricultural lands and began eating grasses and <line> <line>winter-sown cereals. the brent geese are social, adaptable. they fly <line> <line>around together, learning from each other, even as these groups are <line> <line>often unstable, changing from season to season. songs in their most <line> <line>popular versions tend to be epiphanic, gorgeous with swelling chord <line> <line>changes, full of lament too. and this song, like many, expresses the <line> <line>desire to be near someone who is now lost. it travels as something <line> <line>layered, infiltrated, unconfused with its refusals to make a simple <line> <line>sense. i want to give you this song sung in a bar in oakland one night <line> <line>during the ongoing oil wars. the singer had clearly been lost once, but <line> <line>they sang as someone who eventually got in the car and drove out of <line> <line>bakersfield, perhaps early in the morning, the sun just starting to rise, <line> <line>or perhaps later after sun-up, the light washing out everything in <line> <line>bakersfield as the sun is wont to do there. eventually they arrived to <line> <line>sing this song. this might have taken them many years. there was <line> <line>nothing that implied that the lostness was recent. but the lostness, it <line> <line>was clear, was huge and had been experienced fully by them. it <line> <line>probably doesn't matter where the sun was that day in bakersfield <line> <line>when they got in the car. it probably just matters that there is a sun, <line> <line>still, and they got in the car and drove, drove through the oil fields with <line> <line>their wells pumping out amber colored oils and their refineries with <line> <line>tall towers that heat the oil so as to sort its various viscosities, and drove <line> <line>through the black cloud that is the slow constant burn of the oil wars. <line> <line>then at some point they were in oakland. the oil near bakersfield is <line> <line>heavy but it often benchmarks against the brent blend. brent blend is <line> <line>a light crude oil, though not as light as west texas intermediate. it <line> <line>contains approximately 0.37% of sulphur, classifying it as sweet crude, <line> <line>yet not as sweet as west texas intermediate. when the park is cleared <line> <line>and the building is built, it will headquarter an oil company. when <line> <line>this oil company named their oil fields off the coast of scotland, they <line> <line>choose the names of water birds in alphabetical order: auk, brent, <line> <line>cormorant, dunlin, eider, fulmar, and so on. brent is also an <line> <line>acronym for the jurassic brent formation that makes up the brent <line> <line>oilfield, for broom, rannoch, etive, ness, and tarbert. about two <line> <line>thirds of oil is benchmarked against what is called the brent crude oil <line> <line>spot price. petroleum suppliers in europe, africa and the middle east <line> <line>often price their oil according to brent crude's value on the interconti- <line> <line>nential exchange if it is being sold to the west. the brent crude oil <line> <line>spot price is set in dollars, maintained by force, endlessly manipulated <line> <line>by commodity futures markets. the refrain is the moment when the <line> <line>singer makes it clear that they understand something about what is <line> <line>being lost. it was obvious they had lost their country, it being taken <line> <line>over by bankers and all. they had clearly been rejected. loved too <line> <line>much and gotten too little of it back in return, many times. but none <line> <line>of this matters, it was obvious, in comparison to what is now being lost <line> <line>for that night even though the song is about a minor loss, about the loss <line> <line>of tongue on clit or cock, the singer seemed to understand s0mething <line> <line>about the other things that are lost. while a formation of police clear <line> <line>the far side of the park of the debris of its occupation, another forma- <line> <line>tion of police on the other side shoot the new gasses, the ones we do <line> <line>not yet know by name, into another part of the park where people are <line> <line>now clustered. this camera has sound and every few seconds there is a <line> <line>pop. it is unevenly steady. the song is just about two people who are <line> <line>not near each other, who have probably chosen not to be near each <line> <line>other any more. the song reflects and refracts the oil in ways both <line> <line>relevant and trivial in how it tells about what happens when one lets <line> <line>love go, when one gives up the tongue. it might be that only through <line> <line>the minor we can feel enormity. it might be that there is nothing to <line> <line>epiphany if it does not hint at the moment of sweaty relation larger <line> <line>than the intimate. for what is epiphanic song if it doesn't spill out and <line> <line>over the many that are pulled from intimacies by oil's circulations? <line> <line>the truckers, the sailors and deckhands, the assembly line workers, <line> <line>those who maintain the pipelines, those who drive support in the <line> <line>caravans that escort the tankers, the fertilizers, the thousands of <line> <line>interlocking plastic parts, the workers who move two hundred miles <line> <line>and live in a dorm near a factory, alone, those on the ships who spend <line> <line>fifty weeks circulating with the oil unable to talk to each other because <line> <line>of no shared language and so are left only with two weeks in each year <line> <line>where they can experience the tongue in meaningful conversation. a <line> <line>life that is only circulations. before the police come, before the <line> <line>building, in the middle of one night, a group of people form a line <line> <line>leading to the entrance of the park. or several groups form several <line> <line>lines, all leading to the entrance. some wear medical masks. some <line> <line>wear glasses too. all pass bricks, one by one, down the line so as to <line> <line>make a pile. they are silent for the most part, silent enough that it is <line> <line>possible to hear the bricks make a clink as they fall. the pile gets <line> <line>bigger and bigger. it is waist high. then chest high. some get out of <line> <line>the line and climb on the pile, hold both their hands in the air because <line> <line>they know now is the transitory, momentary triumph and it should be <line> <line>felt. others continue passing brick after brick, from one hand to <line> <line>another hand, arms extended, torsos at moments also going back and <line> <line>forth with the bricks. when they run out of bricks, the pile is topped <line> <line>with fencing. then they gather behind it, waiting. back there, some- <line> <line>one might possibly be singing to a child, singing the epiphanic song <line> <line>that alludes to losing the moment of tongue on clit or cock over and <line> <line>over because the child cannot be comforted, because the singer knows <line> <line>only loss. the room will be dark. the light will be on in the hall. <line> <line>there will be shadows, in other words. and the singer will know about <line> <line>these shadows at this moment and know they had agreed to be with <line> <line>shadows when they had the child. they had gambled in a sense on a <line> <line>question of sustaining. they had agreed to exist from now on with a <line> <line>shadow. a shadow of love and a shadow of the burning of the oil fields that <line> <line>has already happened and is yet to come and yet must come and a million <line> <line>other shadows that might possibly disappear in the light at that moment. <line> <line> <line>","activities,jobs & working,travels & journeys,arts & sciences,music,poetry & poets,social commentaries,cities & urban

(o scholars) this is the ambivalence of classical blues—and the coins came from the blue-devils’ pocket of dipsy muse. across an alp of chitterlings, pungent as epigrams, doctor obi nkomo the alter ego of the harlem gallery —as a news-waif hallooed, “the desert fox is dead!”— clicked his tongue —a residual habit from the veld— and —stout as a peasant in the bread-and-cheese war— said, “the lie of the artist is the only lie for which a mortal or a god should die.” because nobody was a nobody to him, when from his thin charcoal lips irony escaped, it was malice toward none. the therapy of his slips by design into primitive objets d’art humanized the patrons of the harlem gallery as much as the masterworks he salvaged from the lethe of the american way in black manhattan. mr. guy delaporte iii cried out before the regents, “mr. curator, what manner of man is this?” unharassed by the ignis fatuus of a lost job, doctor nkomo clicked throatily and, with a chuckle whispered to me, “it’s not this buckle- head’s right or wrong if he does right or wrong.” like a humming disk came the strophe of a rebel bantu song. hubris is an evil the greeks (euripides, sophocles, aeschylus) boned and fleshed to wear the mask. pride is the lust- sinewed wench the churchman speaks of first in the table of deadly sins: doctor nkomo’s all hail to man was a vane on the wing to winnow the grain in person, place and thing. too many (perhaps) of the regents’ corralled hours doctor nkomo and i left gored in bull rings of pros and cons: without a horse-opera god, the ultra dons the matador’s black of the wherefore and the why, or hoists the white flag and lets the red cells in the marrow die. his idée fixe ebbed and flowed across the dinner table: “absurd life shakes its ass’s ears in cendrars’—not nkomo’s—stable. if, anchored like hooks of a hag-fish to sea weeds and patient as a weaver in haute-lisse tapestry, a rivera or a picasso, with a camel-hair alchemy, paints in fresco-buono the seven panels of a man’s tridimensionality in variforms and varicolors— since virtue has no kelvin scale, since a mother breeds no twins alike, since no man is an escape running wild from self-sown seeds— then, no man, judged by his biosocial identity in toto can be a kiefekil or a tartufe, an iscariot or an iago.” is philosophy, then, a tittle’s snack? history, a peacock's almanac? he laughed down at me, a kidney without anchorage, and said: “you must see through the millstone, since you’re not like julio sigafoos and me— an ex-savage.” his ebony forefinger an assagai blade, he mused aloud as the box played in harlem’s juke: “curator of the harlem ghetto, what is a masterpiece? a virgin or a jade, the vis viva of an ape of god, to awaken one, to pleasure one— a way-of-life’s aubade.” black as cypress lawn, the crag of a woman crabsidled in. the breath of a fraxinella in hot weather, her unlooked-for grin evaporated; then, like a well’s spew of mud and oil and raw gas, she blew her top. dipsy muse slumped like uhlan when his feet failed to prop, his squeal the squeal of a peccary ax-poled in its pen. the stem and stern of the elite chitterling shop pitched and ditched in the chatter and squawks, in the clatter and guffaws, as a yarmouth yawl yaws when struck by a rogue-elephant sea. scragged beyond the cavernous door, clamorous as a parrot against the rain, dipsy muse’s vanity scrabbled in vain like an anchor along the neck-gorge of a sea-floor. the jukebox railed and wailed: the black widow spider gets rid of her man, gets rid of her daddy as fast as she can. if you fool around, i know what i’ll do— like the black widow spider i’ll get rid of you. a giraffine fellow whose yellow skin mocked the netted pattern of a cantaloupe opened his rawhide pocketbook to sniff of dope a whiff, with a galley curse and an alley gag; then—laughing, choking, brimstoning his spouse, he caved in like ben franklin’s beggarly bag. doctor nkomo sighed: “the nicks and cuts under a stallion’s tail spur him to carry it higher; but the incised horsetail of a man drains the bones of his i-ness drier.” a black outsider with all his eggs but one in the white man’s basket, he quaffed his beer, stretched his beanpole legs; then —a rubberneck robin hood in a morris dance— readied a hobby with another color for a ride beyond the afrikaner’s stance. “o, romeo,” he said, “o casanova, prithee, what is chivalrous—what, barbaric? (why gnaw one’s thoughts to the bone?) when a cavemen painted a rubric figure of his mate with a gritstone, eros conquered thanatos.” his eyes glistening dots of an ice plant, he said: “my western friends —with deserts to be turned into green pastures— rent diving bells to get the bends, curfew morals, incubate tsetse flies, stage a barroom brawl of means and ends in a cul-de-sac. (eagles dying of hunger with cocks in their claws!) that rebel jukebox! hear the ghetto’s dark guffaws that defy manhattan’s bible belt! aeons separate my native veld and your peaks of philosophy: i made the trek, curator, on man’s vegetable ivory, in threescore years and ten.” a whale of a man, i thought, a true, but not a typical, mammal. he absorbs alien ideas as urdu arabic characters. in a sepulchral corner, i glimpsed a scarlet sister mary on the make, her lips dark and juicy like a half-done t-bone steak. the giraffine fellow eyed us with a dog-ape look and outed his impatience in a sigh; a single-acting plunger cast the die, “mister, who are you?” his catarrhal eye baited by doctor nkomo’s hair (the silvery gray patina of a japanese alloy), he was but a squeaking cleopatra boy when the reply came like the undershot of a poncelet water wheel: “obi nkomo, my dear watson; but that is nil, a water stair that meanders to no vessel. if you ask what am i, you dash on rocks the wisdom and the will of solon and solomon. am i a bee drugged on the honey of sophistry? am i a fish from a river jordan, fated to die as soon as it reaches an asphalt sea?” not a sound came from the yellow giraffine fellow— not a sound from the bowels of this ixion bound to the everlasting revolving ghetto wheel. nearer the ground than townsend’s solitaire, doctor nkomo raked his hair … his brain … but he did not blink the cliff of ice. “what am i? what are you? perhaps we are twin colors in a crystal. when i was a zulu lad, i heard an old-wives’ tale for seven-foot-spear chakas to be. in a barnyard near a buffalo trail a hunter discovered an eagle eating dung with chickens. he carried the feathered rex to a mountain top, although it raised the dickens. the hunter explained, ‘you're not a chicken, aquila.’ he launched the ungainly bird into space. a fouled umbrella! in the wing lock of habit, it tumbled in disgrace … down … down … down a ghostified cock! “out of the visaing face of the sun swooped the falcon baron clarioning the summons of an aeried race. twice the barnyard eagle answered the solar city wight; thrice he spiraled the simoom-blistered height— braked and banked and beaked upward, upward, into transfiguring light. old probabilities, what am i? mister, what are you? an eagle or a chicken come home to roost? i wish i knew!” his character (in the greek sense) phrased a nonplus—needed a metaphor’s translation. as an african prince, kings and chiefs peacocked themselves behind him; and he, himself tough-conscienced, had slain heathenism, the giant grim, without a backward cry. scot and plot, caste and class, rifted right angles to the curving grain. the dream of abraham’s bosom bottled long ago, he walked the pork barrel’s porphyry street with the man in the ears; and the glassy rivers of talk —heraclitean, fabian, marxian— in the lights and shadows of the illuminating gas, bona fides, limned a figure and cast of homo aethiopicus who knew all riverine traffickers pass beyond the seven walls of water—to join … the last of the greeks … of the romans, the last. once in a while his apology shaped itself like the symbol q in a skipper’s log. during the falconry in the chamber of the regents, mr. delaporte iii flew off at a tangent and off the handle. doctor nkomo’s dandie dinmount terrier epithet sprang across the tables. my gavel big-talked in slang. like a turtle’s head, the session withdrew into its shell. the old africanist bowed cavalierly and said: “i’ve called the gentleman a liar —it’s true— and i am sorry for it.” wealth of the fettered, illth of the lettered, left his realism, like rock dust, unweathered: one who eyes the needle of the present to knit the future’s garb. in his own buttoned guise he seemed to speak to the man friday in everyman boned and lined and veined for the twelve great fatigues to the promised land: “the golden mean of the dark wayfarer’s way between black scylla and white charybdis, i have traveled; subdued ifs in the way; from vile-canaille balconies and nigger heavens, seen day beasts and night beasts of prey in the disemboweling pits of europe and america, in the death-worming bowels of asia and africa; and, although a dumb ox (like young aquinas), i have not forgot the rainbows and the olive leaves against the orient sky. “the basso profundo gibbon of putney —not the lyric tenor, thomas of celano— hymns the dies irae!” <line>","living,life choices,the mind,relationships,family & ancestors,arts & sciences,music,philosophy,social commentaries,class,race & ethnicity"

or did god mean to scourge with scorpions for a rod our sins, faustine? i know what queen at first you were, as though i had seen red gold and black imperious hair twice crown faustine. as if your fed sarcophagus spared flesh and skin, you come back face to face with us, the same faustine. she loved the games men played with death, where death must win; as though the slain man's blood and breath revived faustine. nets caught the pike, pikes tore the net; lithe limbs and lean from drained-out pores dripped thick red sweat to soothe faustine. she drank the steaming drift and dust blown off the scene; blood could not ease the bitter lust that galled faustine. all round the foul fat furrows reeked, where blood sank in; the circus splashed and seethed and shrieked all round faustine. but these are gone now: years entomb the dust and din; yea, even the bath's fierce reek and fume that slew faustine. was life worth living then? and now is life worth sin? where are the imperial years? and how are you faustine? your soul forgot her joys, forgot her times of teen; yea, this life likewise will you not forget, faustine? for in the time we know not of did fate begin weaving the web of days that wove your doom, faustine. the threads were wet with wine, and all were smooth to spin; they wove you like a bacchanal, the first faustine. and bacchus cast your mates and you wild grapes to glean; your flower-like lips were dashed with dew from his, faustine. your drenched loose hands were stretched to hold the vine's wet green, long ere they coined in roman gold your face, faustine. then after change of soaring feather and winnowing fin, you woke in weeks of feverish weather, a new faustine. a star upon your birthday burned, whose fierce serene red pulseless planet never yearned in heaven, faustine. stray breaths of sapphic song that blew through mitylene shook the fierce quivering blood in you by night, faustine. the shameless nameless love that makes hell's iron gin shut on you like a trap that breaks the soul, faustine. and when your veins were void and dead, what ghosts unclean swarmed round the straitened barren bed that hid faustine? what sterile growths of sexless root or epicene? what flower of kisses without fruit of love, faustine? what adders came to shed their coats? what coiled obscene small serpents with soft stretching throats caressed faustine? but the time came of famished hours, maimed loves and mean, this ghastly thin-faced time of ours, to spoil faustine. you seem a thing that hinges hold, a love-machine with clockwork joints of supple gold — no more, faustine. not godless, for you serve one god, the lampsacene, who metes the gardens with his rod; your lord, faustine. if one should love you with real love (such things have been, things your fair face knows nothing of, it seems, faustine); that clear hair heavily bound back, the lights wherein shift from dead blue to burnt-up black; your throat, faustine, strong, heavy, throwing out the face and hard bright chin and shameful scornful lips that grace their shame, faustine, curled lips, long since half kissed away, still sweet and keen; you'd give him — poison shall we say?

<line> <line>2. wide <line> <line>the “wide” is always haunted by surprise. in a dark world, the “wide” is the sudden door that opens on unfurling blackness, the void pooling at the bottom of the unlit stairs. to be bounded is our usual condition; to be open is anomalous, even excessive. <line> <line> <line> <line>a wide-eyed girl is extreme in her unliddedness, her bare membranes flinching at any contact, vulnerable to motes, to smuts, to dryness. a wide-hipped girl extends the splayed arches of her body to bridge the generational divide. a wide-legged girl unseals a portal between persons; she is disturbing to the extent that she is open to all comers, a trapdoor that must be shut for safety’s sake. a wide-eyed girl is often thought desirable; a wide-hipped girl is often thought eligible; a wide-legged girl is often thought deplorable. a wide-legged girl is rarely wide-eyed, though she may have started out that way. <line> <line> <line> <line>we can understand why milton, in the narrowing orbit of his blindness, would have considered wideness, unboundedness to be threatening. what’s less clear is why the wideness of the wide-legged girl is also considered threatening. does the wideness of the wide-legged girl evoke a kind of blindness, a dark room where one might blunder into strangers, the way two men once met each other in me? <line> <line>3. hide <line> <line>“but why hide it in a hole?” asks the master, returning from his long absence, sparks of bewilderment flaring into rage. <line> <line> <line> <line>an unanswered question worries at the parable of the talents: why is the master so terribly angry? it is not as if the servant had stolen the money, or spent it—his sin is one of omission, of overly risk-averse investing. a talent was a unit of weight in ancient greece: in monetary terms, it was worth eighty pounds of silver, or 6,000 denarii—nearly twenty years’ wages for the average worker. but milton uses the word in its more modern sense, dating from the fifteenth century: a natural ability or skill. <line> <line> <line> <line>how did a word for a deadweight of metal come to mean something inborn, innate? confusion between the inorganic and the natural trickles into the parable and the poem. the master prides himself on being a man who reaps where he has not sown and gathers where he did not scatter seed. was the servant’s fault to confuse coins for seeds, did he think he was planting when he was merely burying, did he mistake for viable what had no chance of living, what had never been alive? <line> <line>4. bent <line> <line>and what about the hole, which for so long had held treasure? did it wonder why — despite all the moistness and richness it could muster — those cold, glinting seeds never sprouted? did it understand that, if released into the wider world, the coins could have quickened, multiplied? that instead of an incubator, the hole had become an oubliette, a place where otherwise fruitful things were sent to languish, to become lodged, useless? <line> <line> <line> <line>“useless” — a word like a capped lead pipe, like the extra bone in my foot i will never pass down to my daughter. <line> <line> <line> <line>a thing becomes useless if it is bent out of shape. to “get bent” is to be put to another kind of use, a use my therapist considered tantamount to rape. to bend is to be bound, to bow down without breaking, with perhaps just the head tilted at an angle so as to peer upward. <line> <line>5. present <line> <line>the master has become the maker. the servile body wholly “his,” splayed wide in a welcome-home, bound up in a beribboned bow. <line> <line> <line> <line>but the reader will object. this is all wrong. first of all, in the sonnet, “bent” doesn’t mean to bow down as if in submission to an outside force, but instead denotes an innate or internalized tendency or inclination. second, a “present” is not a gift, but a verb meaning to offer openly, full-faced, the sun beaming down on a clean page. third, the body never comes into it at all. <line> <line>“therewith” — a safe word, a strongbox to be buried.6. chide <line> <line>is a “true account” a story or a sum? is the maker an audience or an auditor? <line> <line> <line> <line>the page scoured white by little grains of fear. <line> <line> <line> <line>a story has an ending. a sum has a bottom line. there was no accounting for me because my allotment leaked out of me, month after month, i scrubbed the sheets as if effacing the marks of a crime. <line> <line> <line> <line>then one day the fear reversed itself. like a photo negative but in higher contrast—its whites more glaring and its darks more glossy, as if a whisper-thin suspicion had come unzipped. <line> <line> <line> <line>“chide” is an enormous understatement. the servant isn’t merely scolded, he is cast into “the outer darkness” where there is “weeping and gnashing of teeth.” if the “outer darkness” is deemed to be a punishment, then does that lustrous inner darkness count as a reward? <line> <line>7. denied <line> <line>it seems unfair, is milton’s point. to be assigned a task, but not provided sufficient materials to complete it, is to be placed in a situation of contrived scarcity, like a lab rat or like the youngest sister in a fairy tale. <line> <line> <line> <line>the parable of the wise and foolish virgins—which prefaces the parable of the talents — centers on this scarcity. the virgins wait for the bridegroom, to greet him with lamps alight. five virgins have brought extra flasks of oil, but five virgins have let their lamps burn out and must go lampless into the night to look for oil. that much we are told, but questions hover around the shadowed margins of the story. why isn’t the bridegroom with the bride? why is he so delayed? why is the bridegroom met in the middle of the night by a phalanx of lamp-bearing virgins, like a troupe of pom-pom girls or like a sacrificial rite? <line> <line> <line> <line>the virginity of the virgins renders them piquant, memorable. adorning gothic portals, evoking thresholds, entrances, they are a particular feature of french cathedrals—much more so, one suspects, than if the parable had called them “maidservants” or even “bridesmaids.” <line> <line> <line> <line>the presumed desideratum of the story does not interest us much: the sated bridegroom at the midnight feast, the smug, unctuous faces of the wise virgins. instead, the imagination pursues the foolish virgins rushing into the night, their desperation making them vulnerable, their vulnerability making them erotic, the fill-holes of their useless lamps dark and slick with oil. is this how i was taught to sexualize insufficiency, the lack that set me wandering night after night, my body too early emptied out? <line> <line>8. prevent <line> <line>“prevent” — a word like a white sheet folded back to cover the mouth. <line> <line> <line> <line>a white egg bursts from the ovary and falls away, leaving a star-shaped scar. corpus albicans, the whitening body. such starbursts, at first, are scattered constellations, frost embroidering a dark field. but at what point does this white lacework shift over from intricacy to impossibility, opacity, obstacle—the ice disc clogging the round pond, the grid of proteins baffling the eye? <line> <line> <line> <line>“prevent” — a word that slams shut, a portcullis (latin: cataracta). <line> <line> <line> <line>letter to leonard philaras, september 28, 1654: “the dimness which i experience by night and day, seems to incline more to white than to black.” <line> <line>9. need <line> <line>has patience been looming in the background all along, silent, so as not to intrude upon a blind man’s consciousness? patience, whose garment is “white and close-fitting so that it is not blown about or disturbed by the wind.” <line> <line> <line> <line>at the turn of the sonnet, patience pries open its sculpted lips, its stiff tongue like a weaver’s shuttle drawing woolly strands through the warp and weft of milton’s blindness, a white monologue that admits neither interruption nor rejoinder. <line> <line> <line> <line>milton’s little murmur stitched back into his mouth. <line> <line> <line> <line>woven tight enough to repel need — a liquid beading on the surface, the blood the needles drew from me week after week, hundreds of stoppered vials consigned to the biohazard bin, en route to the incinerator. <line> <line> <line> <line>“need,” from the high german, for danger. <line> <line> <line> <line>“murmur,” from the sanskrit, a crackling fire. <line> <line>10. best <line> <line>the best beam in contentment, ranging themselves in rows. erect as test tubes but forswearing undue pride in such uprightness, mustering shoulder-to-shoulder with the fellow-elect. the best arrayed in regimental ranks, in refrigerated racks, white hymn of the unneeded, white hum of the unneeding. <line> <line> <line> <line>“best,” originally superlative of bot (old english: remedy, reparation). <line> <line> <line> <line>the best affect a pious pose, mouths held taut in tongueless os. sotto voce chorus of that soft, subjunctive song: if you were complete ... if you were replete ... <line> <line> <line> <line>superlative. the most remediated. the most repaired. <line> <line>11. state <line> <line>to be scooped out, emptied of need and rinsed clean of its greasy smears, pristine as a petri dish on a stainless lab table. enucleated, the white of the egg awaiting an unknown yolk. <line> <line> <line> <line>“yolk” from geolu (old english: yellow). not to be confused with “yoke” from geocian (old english: to be joined together). a yoke is an implement, meant to be used, to fill a need. but where there is no field to be plowed, no wagon to be pulled, why demand a yoke that is useless, needless? <line> <line> <line> <line>one day the romans sent for cincinnatus to lead the republic against the invading aequian army. he laid down his plow in the field and went to war. when the aequians surrendered, cincinnatus spared their lives but decreed that they must “pass under the yoke.” the romans fashioned a yoke from three spears, two fixed in the ground, and one tied across the tops of the two verticals. since the horizontal spear was only a few feet off the ground, the aequians were made to crouch down like animals in order to complete the surrender. this is thought to be the origin of the word “subjugate,” to be brought under the yoke. to bear a yoke is to be bowed down, oxbowed, cowed. <line> <line> <line> <line>one day they laid me down on a gurney, my feet strapped in stirrups, my legs bent and splayed like the horns of a white bull. <line> <line>12. speed <line> <line>but why would milton, of all people, use the word “kingly” as a compliment? roundheaded milton, who wrote tract after tract in defense of regicide, who would later be detained for opposing the restoration? <line> <line> <line> <line>at this point, our suspicions are confirmed: milton has disappeared entirely from the poem. we haven’t heard from him since the turn of the sonnet. we’ve been lulled by the cadenced voice of patience, its dusty tongue self-lubricating, its pallid breath clouding the room, precipitating frangible chains of hydrocarbons, their branchings barbed like fluffs of eiderdown. through the faint reticulations, we discern no dark stoop-shouldered figure, but only white-robed forms, upright as if hung from hooks, their faces unyielding as lanterns, shuttered as if once aflame. <line> <line>13. rest <line> <line>rest — a word like a gauze bandage, a ropy weave of collagen knitting its way across a wound. outspread as if fingered, gelid gestures suggesting solace: to stanch, to shield, to seal, to shut off. <line> <line> <line> <line>rest — the rind of the best, a contoured pod that cradles the shape of what it doesn’t hold. <line> <line> <line> <line>rest — those who are left when thousands have sped away, the bereft, who litter the land, with husks for hands, vacant-eyed, vacant faces raised like basins under a contrail-scarred sky. <line> <line>14. wait <line> <line>to stand and wait is a task far weightier than simply to wait. it is to permit the distractible body neither ease nor action, nor food nor drink nor any such reprieve; it is to pit the body in enmity against its own heaviness. <line> <line> <line> <line>to abide in readiness as in a winter orchard, the lacerated land bandaged in snow. to exist inert as if limbless, skin seamless as if reknit over what had been pruned away, knotted rootstock fit for no other service: no branch, no leaf, no fruit. to persist as a stripped stick persists in a white field, bark peeled back from one exposed split, uptilted as if eager for the grafted slip. <line> <line> <line> <line>to stand and wait for the one who reaps where he has not sown. <line> <line> <line> <line>mercy sugars the starving soil with nitrogen, potassium, phosphate. mercy captures rain in silver beads and stitches them through the threadbare weave of cloud. mercy wields a scalpel cutting a cleft in the lopped-off stump, mercy forces home the rootless wand, mercy seals the join with tar and tape. <line> <line> <line> <line>to foster the raw scion as if it were a son, to siphon light down through its body as if it were your own. <line>","living,the body,arts & sciences,poetry & poets,social commentaries,gender & sexuality,history & politics"

""fairest of mortals, thou distinguish'd care of thousand bright inhabitants of air! if e'er one vision touch'd thy infant thought, of all the nurse and all the priest have taught, of airy elves by moonlight shadows seen, the silver token, and the circled green, or virgins visited by angel pow'rs, with golden crowns and wreaths of heav'nly flow'rs, hear and believe! thy own importance know, nor bound thy narrow views to things below. some secret truths from learned pride conceal'd, to maids alone and children are reveal'd: what tho' no credit doubting wits may give? the fair and innocent shall still believe. know then, unnumber'd spirits round thee fly, the light militia of the lower sky; these, though unseen, are ever on the wing, hang o'er the box, and hover round the ring. think what an equipage thou hast in air, and view with scorn two pages and a chair. as now your own, our beings were of old, and once inclos'd in woman's beauteous mould; thence, by a soft transition, we repair from earthly vehicles to these of air. think not, when woman's transient breath is fled, that all her vanities at once are dead; succeeding vanities she still regards, and tho' she plays no more, o'erlooks the cards. her joy in gilded chariots, when alive, and love of ombre, after death survive. for when the fair in all their pride expire, to their first elements their souls retire: the sprites of fiery termagants in flame mount up, and take a salamander's name. soft yielding minds to water glide away, and sip with nymphs, their elemental tea. the graver prude sinks downward to a gnome, in search of mischief still on earth to roam. the light coquettes in sylphs aloft repair, and sport and flutter in the fields of air. know further yet; whoever fair and chaste rejects mankind, is by some sylph embrac'd: for spirits, freed from mortal laws, with ease assume what sexes and what shapes they please. what guards the purity of melting maids, in courtly balls, and midnight masquerades, safe from the treach'rous friend, the daring spark, the glance by day, the whisper in the dark, when kind occasion prompts their warm desires, when music softens, and when dancing fires? 'tis but their sylph, the wise celestials know, though honour is the word with men below. some nymphs there are, too conscious of their face, for life predestin'd to the gnomes' embrace. these swell their prospects and exalt their pride, when offers are disdain'd, and love denied: then gay ideas crowd the vacant brain, while peers, and dukes, and all their sweeping train, and garters, stars, and coronets appear, and in soft sounds 'your grace' salutes their ear. 'tis these that early taint the female soul, instruct the eyes of young coquettes to roll, teach infant cheeks a bidden blush to know, and little hearts to flutter at a beau. oft, when the world imagine women stray, the sylphs through mystic mazes guide their way, thro' all the giddy circle they pursue, and old impertinence expel by new. what tender maid but must a victim fall to one man's treat, but for another's ball? when florio speaks, what virgin could withstand, if gentle damon did not squeeze her hand? with varying vanities, from ev'ry part, they shift the moving toyshop of their heart; where wigs with wigs, with sword-knots sword-knots strive, beaux banish beaux, and coaches coaches drive. this erring mortals levity may call, oh blind to truth! the sylphs contrive it all. of these am i, who thy protection claim, a watchful sprite, and ariel is my name. late, as i rang'd the crystal wilds of air, in the clear mirror of thy ruling star i saw, alas! some dread event impend, ere to the main this morning sun descend, but heav'n reveals not what, or how, or where: warn'd by the sylph, oh pious maid, beware! this to disclose is all thy guardian can. beware of all, but most beware of man!"" he said; when shock, who thought she slept too long, leap'd up, and wak'd his mistress with his tongue. 'twas then, belinda, if report say true, thy eyes first open'd on a billet-doux; wounds, charms, and ardors were no sooner read, but all the vision vanish'd from thy head. and now, unveil'd, the toilet stands display'd, each silver vase in mystic order laid. first, rob'd in white, the nymph intent adores with head uncover'd, the cosmetic pow'rs. a heav'nly image in the glass appears, to that she bends, to that her eyes she rears; th' inferior priestess, at her altar's side, trembling, begins the sacred rites of pride. unnumber'd treasures ope at once, and here the various off'rings of the world appear; from each she nicely culls with curious toil, and decks the goddess with the glitt'ring spoil. this casket india's glowing gems unlocks, and all arabia breathes from yonder box. the tortoise here and elephant unite, transform'd to combs, the speckled and the white. here files of pins extend their shining rows, puffs, powders, patches, bibles, billet-doux. now awful beauty puts on all its arms; the fair each moment rises in her charms, repairs her smiles, awakens ev'ry grace, and calls forth all the wonders of her face; sees by degrees a purer blush arise, and keener lightnings quicken in her eyes. the busy sylphs surround their darling care; these set the head, and those divide the hair, some fold the sleeve, whilst others plait the gown; and betty's prais'd for labours not her own. <line>","relationships,friends & enemies,men & women,arts & sciences,humor & satire,social commentaries"

<line> <line>i say, moving over you, my voice crosses <line> <line>out of forbidden chambers of the emperor of china, <line> <line>through chronicles of exile and death in a foreign country, <line> <line>to touch the ground i touch in me <line> <line>when i speak to you. <line> <line>she says, a new mind makes the world new. <line> <line>true words are a little blue. <line> <line>and being human

12276,13087,"<line> <line>there was a roaring in the wind all night; the rain came heavily and fell in floods; but now the sun is rising calm and bright; the birds are singing in the distant woods; over his own sweet voice the stock-dove broods; the jay makes answer as the magpie chatters; and all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters. all things that love the sun are out of doors; the sky rejoices in the morning's birth; the grass is bright with rain-drops;—on the moors the hare is running races in her mirth; and with her feet she from the plashy earth raises a mist, that, glittering in the sun, runs with her all the way, wherever she doth run. i was a traveller then upon the moor; i saw the hare that raced about with joy; i heard the woods and distant waters roar; or heard them not, as happy as a boy: the pleasant season did my heart employ: my old remembrances went from me wholly; and all the ways of men, so vain and melancholy. but, as it sometimes chanceth, from the might of joys in minds that can no further go, as high as we have mounted in delight in our dejection do we sink as low; to me that morning did it happen so; and fears and fancies thick upon me came; dim sadness—and blind thoughts, i knew not, nor could name. i heard the sky-lark warbling in the sky; and i bethought me of the playful hare: even such a happy child of earth am i; even as these blissful creatures do i fare; far from the world i walk, and from all care; but there may come another day to me— solitude, pain of heart, distress, and poverty. my whole life i have lived in pleasant thought, as if life's business were a summer mood; as if all needful things would come unsought to genial faith, still rich in genial good; but how can he expect that others should build for him, sow for him, and at his call love him, who for himself will take no heed at all? i thought of chatterton, the marvellous boy, the sleepless soul that perished in his pride; of him who walked in glory and in joy following his plough, along the mountain-side: by our own spirits are we deified: we poets in our youth begin in gladness; but thereof come in the end despondency and madness. now, whether it were by peculiar grace, a leading from above, a something given, yet it befell that, in this lonely place, when i with these untoward thoughts had striven, beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven i saw a man before me unawares: the oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs. as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence; wonder to all who do the same espy, by what means it could thither come, and whence; so that it seems a thing endued with sense: like a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself; such seemed this man, not all alive nor dead, nor all asleep—in his extreme old age: his body was bent double, feet and head coming together in life's pilgrimage; as if some dire constraint of pain, or rage of sickness felt by him in times long past, a more than human weight upon his frame had cast. himself he propped, limbs, body, and pale face, upon a long grey staff of shaven wood: and, still as i drew near with gentle pace, upon the margin of that moorish flood motionless as a cloud the old man stood, that heareth not the loud winds when they call, and moveth all together, if it move at all. at length, himself unsettling, he the pond stirred with his staff, and fixedly did look upon the muddy water, which he conned, as if he had been reading in a book: and now a stranger's privilege i took; and, drawing to his side, to him did say, ""this morning gives us promise of a glorious day."" a gentle answer did the old man make, in courteous speech which forth he slowly drew: and him with further words i thus bespake, ""what occupation do you there pursue? this is a lonesome place for one like you."" ere he replied, a flash of mild surprise broke from the sable orbs of his yet-vivid eyes. his words came feebly, from a feeble chest, but each in solemn order followed each, with something of a lofty utterance drest— choice word and measured phrase, above the reach of ordinary men; a stately speech; such as grave livers do in scotland use, religious men, who give to god and man their dues. he told, that to these waters he had come to gather leeches, being old and poor: employment hazardous and wearisome! and he had many hardships to endure: from pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor; housing, with god's good help, by choice or chance; and in this way he gained an honest maintenance. the old man still stood talking by my side; but now his voice to me was like a stream scarce heard; nor word from word could i divide; and the whole body of the man did seem like one whom i had met with in a dream; or like a man from some far region sent, to give me human strength, by apt admonishment. my former thoughts returned: the fear that kills; and hope that is unwilling to be fed; cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills; and mighty poets in their misery dead. —perplexed, and longing to be comforted, my question eagerly did i renew, ""how is it that you live, and what is it you do?"" he with a smile did then his words repeat; and said that, gathering leeches, far and wide he travelled; stirring thus about his feet the waters of the pools where they abide. ""once i could meet with them on every side; but they have dwindled long by slow decay; yet still i persevere, and find them where i may."" while he was talking thus, the lonely place, the old man's shape, and speech—all troubled me: in my mind's eye i seemed to see him pace about the weary moors continually, wandering about alone and silently. while i these thoughts within myself pursued, he, having made a pause, the same discourse renewed. and soon with this he other matter blended, cheerfully uttered, with demeanour kind, but stately in the main; and, when he ended, i could have laughed myself to scorn to find in that decrepit man so firm a mind. ""god,"" said i, ""be my help and stay secure; i'll think of the leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!"" <line>","living,the mind,activities,jobs & working,travels & journeys,nature,landscapes & pastorals,arts & sciences,poetry & poets"

12325,8507,"<line> <line>once upon a midnight dreary, while i pondered, weak and weary, <line> <line>over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— <line> <line> while i nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, <line> <line>as of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. <line> <line>“’tis some visitor,” i muttered, “tapping at my chamber door— <line> <line> only this and nothing more.” <line> <line> ah, distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december; <line> <line>and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. <line> <line> eagerly i wished the morrow;—vainly i had sought to borrow <line> <line> from my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost lenore— <line> <line>for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore— <line> <line> nameless here for evermore. <line> <line> and the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain <line> <line>thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; <line> <line> so that now, to still the beating of my heart, i stood repeating <line> <line> “’tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door— <line> <line>some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;— <line> <line> this it is and nothing more.” <line> <line> presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, <line> <line>“sir,” said i, “or madam, truly your forgiveness i implore; <line> <line> but the fact is i was napping, and so gently you came rapping, <line> <line> and so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, <line> <line>that i scarce was sure i heard you”—here i opened wide the door;— <line> <line> darkness there and nothing more. <line> <line> deep into that darkness peering, long i stood there wondering, fearing, <line> <line>doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; <line> <line> but the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, <line> <line> and the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “lenore?” <line> <line>this i whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “lenore!”— <line> <line> merely this and nothing more. <line> <line> back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, <line> <line>soon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. <line> <line> “surely,” said i, “surely that is something at my window lattice; <line> <line> let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore— <line> <line>let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;— <line> <line> ’tis the wind and nothing more!” <line> <line> open here i flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, <line> <line>in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore; <line> <line> not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; <line> <line> but, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door— <line> <line>perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door— <line> <line> perched, and sat, and nothing more. <line> <line>then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, <line> <line>by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, <line> <line>“though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” i said, “art sure no craven, <line> <line>ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore— <line> <line>tell me what thy lordly name is on the night’s plutonian shore!” <line> <line> quoth the raven “nevermore.” <line> <line> much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, <line> <line>though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore; <line> <line> for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being <line> <line> ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door— <line> <line>bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, <line> <line> with such name as “nevermore.” <line> <line> but the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only <line> <line>that one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. <line> <line> nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered— <line> <line> till i scarcely more than muttered “other friends have flown before— <line> <line>on the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.” <line> <line> then the bird said “nevermore.” <line> <line> startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, <line> <line>“doubtless,” said i, “what it utters is its only stock and store <line> <line> caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster <line> <line> followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore— <line> <line>till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore <line> <line> of ‘never—nevermore’.” <line> <line> but the raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, <line> <line>straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door; <line> <line> then, upon the velvet sinking, i betook myself to linking <line> <line> fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore— <line> <line>what this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore <line> <line> meant in croaking “nevermore.” <line> <line> this i sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing <line> <line>to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core; <line> <line> this and more i sat divining, with my head at ease reclining <line> <line> on the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er, <line> <line>but whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er, <line> <line> she shall press, ah, nevermore! <line> <line> then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer <line> <line>swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. <line> <line> “wretch,” i cried, “thy god hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee <line> <line> respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore; <line> <line>quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore!” <line> <line> quoth the raven “nevermore.” <line> <line> “prophet!” said i, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!— <line> <line>whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, <line> <line> desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted— <line> <line> on this home by horror haunted—tell me truly, i implore— <line> <line>is there—is there balm in gilead?—tell me—tell me, i implore!” <line> <line> quoth the raven “nevermore.” <line> <line> “prophet!” said i, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil! <line> <line>by that heaven that bends above us—by that god we both adore— <line> <line> tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant aidenn, <line> <line> it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore— <line> <line>clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore.” <line> <line> quoth the raven “nevermore.” <line> <line> “be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” i shrieked, upstarting— <line> <line>“get thee back into the tempest and the night’s plutonian shore! <line> <line> leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! <line> <line> leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door! <line> <line>take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!” <line> <line> quoth the raven “nevermore.” <line> <line> and the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting <line> <line>on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door;

here’s an aunt waving at us mid-way through the soft-focus neon breakfasts with aunt jemima’s maple syrup (made from maple leaves); here’s a nephew waving at us next to the poster of a red and white michael jordan in a quilted bedroom, his rotund brown body snuggled in tie-dye and tucked into tartan flannel sheets. blackness was a rumor, that is, until michael jackson’s bad ripped into our consciousness and suddenly, knobby-kneed pre-teens found a way to make stringy curls with coconut oil stolen from their mothers’ kitchens and started moonwalking backwards into my social studies classrooms, all snappy crotch and jaunty limbs. we girls rolled our eyes but we kept on watching. <line> <line>it wasn’t long before jackson’s unsparing gaze, draped in slick black leather, began replacing the glowing pastel ganeshes and saraswatis hanging above study desks. but replacing an elephantine god’s soft paunch with lean, mean celebrity did not save us from our own ignorance of how blackness and brownness were connected through a struggle for economic self-realization and human rights. while kids in chennai were rehearsing michael peters’ signature choreography for “thriller” and pretending to be zombies—little exemplary half-dead spectacles—union carbide was industriously shirking responsibility for the bhopal tragedy, which choked thousands of indians to death, and black mortality was spiking in violent, homicidal protest of the us dea’s drug buys and cocaine busts. <line> <line>in other words, tamilians blinked away michael jackson’s blackness. we kept the heat and thunder of his fat synth bass, which found its way into ilayaraaja’s electric disco in films of the late 1980s like vetri vizha and agni natchathiram. we kept the ebullient automation of his moves, which became a muscular theme in prabhu deva’s blend of baggy breakdance and whimsical terukoothu folk dancing in the 1990s. but we forgot his blackness. in time, the lightning of his presence was replaced by the grey hum of cnn, cops, law & order, and the dull horror of handcuffs on dark wrists. posters yellowed, cassettes spooled out, and my moonwalking classmates found their scientific calculators and study guides again. <line> <line>but the rumors of racial difference in george bush sr.’s america continued to bloom and wilt in morose cycles in my childhood homes into the 1990s. in damp clusters, it grew like moss under rocks. rootless, it stretched its stringy arms and held us by the ankles; it grew like mold between bathroom tiles; it spun itself fine and strong, webbing into corners where our brooms couldn’t reach. in time, the mossy rocks lined our after-dinner walks past the hibiscus bushes. in time, a grandmother slipped on the bathroom tiles and stayed in bed, fed conjee by a fatherless girl brought in from the village and the moss grew between her toes and drew her into the earth where they buried the nameless pets and tossed the chicken feathers. in time, the spiders hung so low they fell into pickle jars every time a child fished for a gooseberry or a slice of stony green mango from the brine. and from this brine, in time, we learned to believe that it existed. and as tamilian families began drifting from the flashy monsoons of india to the june gloom of the california bay or to the sharp wet summers of the keys, they carried the damp and stench in suitcases and buried it in hushed conversations. they made a poultice of moss and spider web and lodged it in the prayer books, hung it around the children’s necks like a talisman, and they said—as long as she doesn’t marry a black man. <line>","social commentaries,money & economics,race & ethnicity"

if wrong, i smil'd; if right, i kiss'd the rod. pains, reading, study, are their just pretence, and all they want is spirit, taste, and sense. commas and points they set exactly right, and 'twere a sin to rob them of their mite. yet ne'er one sprig of laurel grac'd these ribalds, from slashing bentley down to pidling tibbalds. each wight who reads not, and but scans and spells, each word-catcher that lives on syllables, ev'n such small critics some regard may claim, preserv'd in milton's or in shakespeare's name. pretty! in amber to observe the forms of hairs, or straws, or dirt, or grubs, or worms; the things, we know, are neither rich nor rare, but wonder how the devil they got there? were others angry? i excus'd them too; well might they rage; i gave them but their due. a man's true merit 'tis not hard to find, but each man's secret standard in his mind, that casting weight pride adds to emptiness, this, who can gratify? for who can guess? the bard whom pilfer'd pastorals renown, who turns a persian tale for half a crown, just writes to make his barrenness appear, and strains, from hard-bound brains, eight lines a year: he, who still wanting, though he lives on theft, steals much, spends little, yet has nothing left: and he, who now to sense, now nonsense leaning, means not, but blunders round about a meaning: and he, whose fustian's so sublimely bad, it is not poetry, but prose run mad: all these, my modest satire bade translate, and own'd, that nine such poets made a tate. how did they fume, and stamp, and roar, and chafe? and swear, not addison himself was safe. peace to all such! but were there one whose fires true genius kindles, and fair fame inspires, blest with each talent and each art to please, and born to write, converse, and live with ease: should such a man, too fond to rule alone, bear, like the turk, no brother near the throne, view him with scornful, yet with jealous eyes, and hate for arts that caus'd himself to rise; damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer, and without sneering, teach the rest to sneer; willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike, just hint a fault, and hesitate dislike; alike reserv'd to blame, or to commend, a tim'rous foe, and a suspicious friend; dreading ev'n fools, by flatterers besieg'd, and so obliging, that he ne'er oblig'd; like cato, give his little senate laws, and sit attentive to his own applause; while wits and templars ev'ry sentence raise, and wonder with a foolish face of praise. who but must laugh, if such a man there be? who would not weep, if atticus were he? what though my name stood rubric on the walls, or plaister'd posts, with claps, in capitals? or smoking forth, a hundred hawkers' load, on wings of winds came flying all abroad? i sought no homage from the race that write; i kept, like asian monarchs, from their sight: poems i heeded (now berhym'd so long) no more than thou, great george! a birthday song. i ne'er with wits or witlings pass'd my days, to spread about the itch of verse and praise; nor like a puppy, daggled through the town, to fetch and carry sing-song up and down; nor at rehearsals sweat, and mouth'd, and cried, with handkerchief and orange at my side; but sick of fops, and poetry, and prate, to bufo left the whole castalian state. proud as apollo on his forked hill, sat full-blown bufo, puff'd by every quill; fed with soft dedication all day long, horace and he went hand in hand in song. his library (where busts of poets dead and a true pindar stood without a head,) receiv'd of wits an undistinguish'd race, who first his judgment ask'd, and then a place: much they extoll'd his pictures, much his seat, and flatter'd ev'ry day, and some days eat: till grown more frugal in his riper days, he paid some bards with port, and some with praise, to some a dry rehearsal was assign'd, and others (harder still) he paid in kind. dryden alone (what wonder?) came not nigh, dryden alone escap'd this judging eye: but still the great have kindness in reserve, he help'd to bury whom he help'd to starve. may some choice patron bless each grey goose quill! may ev'ry bavius have his bufo still! so, when a statesman wants a day's defence, or envy holds a whole week's war with sense, or simple pride for flatt'ry makes demands, may dunce by dunce be whistled off my hands! blest be the great! for those they take away, and those they left me—for they left me gay; left me to see neglected genius bloom, neglected die! and tell it on his tomb; of all thy blameless life the sole return my verse, and queensb'ry weeping o'er thy urn! oh let me live my own! and die so too! (""to live and die is all i have to do:"") maintain a poet's dignity and ease, and see what friends, and read what books i please. above a patron, though i condescend sometimes to call a minister my friend: i was not born for courts or great affairs; i pay my debts, believe, and say my pray'rs; can sleep without a poem in my head, nor know, if dennis be alive or dead. why am i ask'd what next shall see the light? heav'ns! was i born for nothing but to write? has life no joys for me? or (to be grave) have i no friend to serve, no soul to save? ""i found him close with swift""—""indeed? no doubt"", (cries prating balbus) ""something will come out"". 'tis all in vain, deny it as i will.

digging a hole in the mud and standing all day in the rain by it waiting his doom; the sharp blow, the swift outpouring of the blood, till the trench of gray mud is turned to a brown purple drain by it. well, there have been scars won in many wars . . .punic, lacedæmonian, wars of napoleon, wars for faith, wars for honour, for love, for possession, but this belgian man in his ugly tunic, his ugly round cap, shooting on, in a sort of obsession, overspreading his miserable land, standing with his wet gun in his hand . . . doom! he finds that in a sudden scrimmage, and lies, an unsightly lump on the sodden grass . . . an image that shall take long to pass! iii for the white-limbed heroes of hellas ride by upon their horses forever through our brains. the heroes of cressy ride by upon their stallions; and battalions and battalions and battalions— the old guard, the young guard, the men of minden and of waterloo, pass, for ever staunch, stand, for ever true; and the small man with the large paunch, and the gray coat, and the large hat, and the hands behind the back, watches them pass in our minds for ever . . . but that clutter of sodden corses on the sodden belgian grass— that is a strange new beauty. iv with no especial legends of marchings or triumphs or duty, assuredly that is the way of it, the way of beauty . . . and that is the highest word you can find to say of it. for you cannot praise it with words compounded of lyres and swords, but the thought of the gloom and the rain and the ugly coated figure, standing beside a drain, shall eat itself into your brain: and you will say of all heroes, “they fought like the belgians!” and you will say: “he wrought like a belgian his fate out of gloom.” and you will say: “he bought like a belgian his doom.” and that shall be an honourable name; “belgian” shall be an honourable word; as honourable as the fame of the sword, as honourable as the mention of the many-chorded lyre, and his old coat shall seem as beautiful as the fabrics woven in tyre. v and what in the world did they bear it for? i don't know. and what in the world did they dare it for? perhaps that is not for the likes of me to understand. they could very well have watched a hundred legions go over their fields and between their cities down into more southerly regions. they could very well have let the legions pass through their woods, and have kept their lives and their wives and their children and cattle and goods. i don't understand. was it just love of their land? oh, poor dears! can any man so love his land? give them a thousand thousand pities and rivers and rivers of tears to wash off the blood from the cities of flanders. vi this is charing cross; it is midnight; there is a great crowd and no light. a great crowd, all black that hardly whispers aloud. surely, that is a dead woman—a dead mother! she has a dead face; she is dressed all in black; she wanders to the bookstall and back, at the back of the crowd; and back again and again back, she sways and wanders. this is charing cross; it is one o'clock. there is still a great cloud, and very little light; immense shafts of shadows over the black crowd that hardly whispers aloud. . . and now! . . that is another dead mother, and there is another and another and another. . . and little children, all in black, all with dead faces, waiting in all the waiting-places, wandering from the doors of the waiting-room in the dim gloom. these are the women of flanders.they await the lost. they await the lost that shall never leave the dock; they await the lost that shall never again come by the train to the embraces of all these women with dead faces; they await the lost who lie dead in trench and barrier and foss, in the dark of the night. this is charing cross; it is past one of the clock; there is very little light. there is so much pain. l’envoi and it was for this that they endured this gloom; this october like november, that august like a hundred thousand hours, and that september, a hundred thousand dragging sunlit days, and half october like a thousand years. . . oh, poor dears! <line>","living,death,sorrow & grieving,social commentaries,war & conflict,mythology & folklore,horror"

""blessed be god! for he created death!"" the mourners said, ""and death is rest and peace;"" then added, in the certainty of faith, ""and giveth life that nevermore shall cease."" closed are the portals of their synagogue, no psalms of david now the silence break, no rabbi reads the ancient decalogue in the grand dialect the prophets spake. gone are the living, but the dead remain, and not neglected; for a hand unseen, scattering its bounty, like a summer rain, still keeps their graves and their remembrance green. how came they here? what burst of christian hate, what persecution, merciless and blind, drove o'er the sea — that desert desolate — these ishmaels and hagars of mankind? they lived in narrow streets and lanes obscure, ghetto and judenstrass, in mirk and mire; taught in the school of patience to endure the life of anguish and the death of fire. all their lives long, with the unleavened bread and bitter herbs of exile and its fears, the wasting famine of the heart they fed, and slaked its thirst with marah of their tears. anathema maranatha! was the cry that rang from town to town, from street to street; at every gate the accursed mordecai was mocked and jeered, and spurned by christian feet. pride and humiliation hand in hand walked with them through the world where'er they went; trampled and beaten were they as the sand, and yet unshaken as the continent. for in the background figures vague and vast of patriarchs and of prophets rose sublime, and all the great traditions of the past they saw reflected in the coming time. and thus forever with reverted look the mystic volume of the world they read, spelling it backward, like a hebrew book, till life became a legend of the dead. but ah! what once has been shall be no more! the groaning earth in travail and in pain brings forth its races, but does not restore, and the dead nations never rise again. <line>","living,death,nature,seas, rivers, & streams,religion,judaism,passover"

""so intimate, this chopin, that i think his soul should be resurrected only among friends some two or three, who will not touch the bloom that is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."" —and so the conversation slips among velleities and carefully caught regrets through attenuated tones of violins mingled with remote cornets and begins.

""and so you are going abroad; and when do you return? but that's a useless question. you hardly know when you are coming back, you will find so much to learn."" my smile falls heavily among the bric-à-brac.

""i have been wondering frequently of late (but our beginnings never know our ends!) why we have not developed into friends."" i feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark suddenly, his expression in a glass. my self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark. ""for everybody said so, all our friends, they all were sure our feelings would relate so closely! i myself can hardly understand. we must leave it now to fate. you will write, at any rate. perhaps it is not too late. i shall sit here, serving tea to friends."" and i must borrow every changing shape to find expression ... dance, dance like a dancing bear, cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape. let us take the air, in a tobacco trance— well! and what if she should die some afternoon, afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose; should die and leave me sitting pen in hand with the smoke coming down above the housetops; doubtful, for quite a while not knowing what to feel or if i understand or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon ... would she not have the advantage, after all? this music is successful with a ""dying fall"" now that we talk of dying— and should i have the right to smile? <line>","living,death,disappointment & failure,growing old,time & brevity,love,break-ups & vexed love,heartache & loss,realistic & complicated,relationships,men & women,arts & sciences,poetry & poets"

hath it spread no covering splendid as the sun-god's hair to veil or to reveal thy lordlier head? xii hath not the sunset strewn across the sea a way majestical enough for thee? what hour save this should be thine hour—and mine, if thou have care of any less divine than thine own soul; if thou take thought of me, marlowe, as all my soul takes thought of thine?

xix the shadow stayed not, but the splendour stays, our brother, till the last of english days. no day nor night on english earth shall be for ever, spring nor summer, junes nor mays, but somewhat as a sound or gleam of thee shall come on us like morning from the sea. xx like sunrise never wholly risen, nor yet quenched; or like sunset never wholly set, a light to lighten as from living eyes the cold unlit close lids of one that lies dead, or a ray returned from death's far skies to fire us living lest our lives forget. xxi for in that heaven what light of lights may be, what splendour of what stars, what spheres of flame sounding, that none may number nor may name, we know not, even thy brethren; yea, not we whose eyes desire the light that lightened thee, whose ways and thine are one way and the same. xxii but if the riddles that in sleep we read, and trust them not, be flattering truth indeed, as he that rose our mightiest called them,—he, much higher than thou as thou much higher than we— there, might we say, all flower of all our seed, all singing souls are as one sounding sea. xxiii all those that here were of thy kind and kin, beside thee and below thee, full of love, full-souled for song,—and one alone above whose only light folds all your glories in— with all birds' notes from nightingale to dove fill the world whither we too fain would win. xxiv the world that sees in heaven the sovereign light of sunlike shakespeare, and the fiery night whose stars were watched of webster; and beneath, the twin-souled brethren of the single wreath, grown in kings' gardens, plucked from pastoral heath, wrought with all flowers for all men's heart's delight. xxv and that fixed fervour, iron-red like mars, in the mid moving tide of tenderer stars, that burned on loves and deeds the darkest done, athwart the incestuous prisoner's bride-house bars; and thine, most highest of all their fires but one, our morning star, sole risen before the sun. xxvi and one light risen since theirs to run such race thou hast seen, o phosphor, from thy pride of place. thou hast seen shelley, him that was to thee as light to fire or dawn to lightning; me, me likewise, o our brother, shalt thou see, and i behold thee, face to glorious face?

but ye— o, more than sunrise to the blind cold sea, that wailed aloud with all her waves all night, much more, being much more glorious, should you be. xxxiv as fire to frost, as ease to toil, as dew to flowerless fields, as sleep to slackening pain, as hope to souls long weaned from hope again returning, or as blood revived anew to dry-drawn limbs and every pulseless vein, even so toward us should no man be but you. xxxv one rose before the sunrise was, and one before the sunset, lovelier than the sun. and now the heaven is dark and bright and loud with wind and starry drift and moon and cloud, and night's cry rings in straining sheet and shroud, what help is ours if hope like yours be none? xxxvi o well-beloved, our brethren, if ye be, then are we not forsaken. this kind earth made fragrant once for all time with your birth, and bright for all men with your love, and worth the clasp and kiss and wedlock of the sea, were not your mother if not your brethren we. xxxvii because the days were dark with gods and kings and in time's hand the old hours of time as rods, when force and fear set hope and faith at odds, ye failed not nor abased your plume-plucked wings; and we that front not more disastrous things, how should we fail in face of kings and gods? xxxviii for now the deep dense plumes of night are thinned surely with winnowing of the glimmering wind whose feet we fledged with morning; and the breath begins in heaven that sings the dark to death. and all the night wherein men groaned and sinned sickens at heart to hear what sundawn saith. xxxix o first-born sons of hope and fairest, ye whose prows first clove the thought-unsounded sea whence all the dark dead centuries rose to bar the spirit of man lest truth should make him free, the sunrise and the sunset, seeing one star, take heart as we to know you that ye are. xl ye rise not and ye set not; we that say ye rise and set like hopes that set and rise look yet but seaward from a land-locked bay; but where at last the sea's line is the sky's and truth and hope one sunlight in your eyes, no sunrise and no sunset marks their day. <line>","nature,seas, rivers, & streams,stars, planets, heavens,arts & sciences,poetry & poets"

for now satan, now first inflam'd with rage, came down, the tempter ere th' accuser of man-kind, to wreck on innocent frail man his loss of that first battel, and his flight to hell: yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold, far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast, begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest, and like a devillish engine back recoiles upon himself; horror and doubt distract his troubl'd thoughts, and from the bottom stirr the hell within him, for within him hell he brings, and round about him, nor from hell one step no more then from himself can fly by change of place: now conscience wakes despair that slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie of what he was, what is, and what must be worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue. sometimes towards eden which now in his view lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad, sometimes towards heav'n and the full-blazing sun, which now sat high in his meridian towre: then much revolving, thus in sighs began. o thou that with surpassing glory crownd, look'st from thy sole dominion like the god of this new world; at whose sight all the starrs hide thir diminisht heads; to thee i call, but with no friendly voice, and add thy name o sun, to tell thee how i hate thy beams that bring to my remembrance from what state i fell, how glorious once above thy spheare; till pride and worse ambition threw me down warring in heav'n against heav'ns matchless king: ah wherefore! he deservd no such return from me, whom he created what i was in that bright eminence, and with his good upbraided none; nor was his service hard. what could be less then to afford him praise, the easiest recompence, and pay him thanks, how due! yet all his good prov'd ill in me, and wrought but malice; lifted up so high i sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher would set me highest, and in a moment quit the debt immense of endless gratitude, so burthensome still paying, still to ow; forgetful what from him i still receivd, and understood not that a grateful mind by owing owes not, but still pays, at once indebted and dischargd; what burden then? o had his powerful destiny ordaind me some inferiour angel, i had stood then happie; no unbounded hope had rais'd ambition. yet why not? som other power as great might have aspir'd, and me though mean drawn to his part; but other powers as great fell not, but stand unshak'n, from within or from without, to all temptations arm'd. hadst thou the same free will and power to stand? thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse, but heav'ns free love dealt equally to all? be then his love accurst, since love or hate, to me alike, it deals eternal woe. nay curs'd be thou; since against his thy will chose freely what it now so justly rues. me miserable! which way shall i flie infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire? which way i flie is hell; my self am hell; and in the lowest deep a lower deep still threatning to devour me opens wide, to which the hell i suffer seems a heav'n. o then at last relent: is there no place left for repentance, none for pardon left? none left but by submission; and that word disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame among the spirits beneath, whom i seduc'd with other promises and other vaunts then to submit, boasting i could subdue th' omnipotent. ay me, they little know how dearly i abide that boast so vaine, under what torments inwardly i groane; while they adore me on the throne of hell, with diadem and scepter high advanc'd the lower still i fall, onely supream in miserie; such joy ambition findes. but say i could repent and could obtaine by act of grace my former state; how soon would higth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay what feign'd submission swore: ease would recant vows made in pain, as violent and void. for never can true reconcilement grow where wounds of deadly hate have peirc'd so deep: which would but lead me to a worse relapse and heavier fall: so should i purchase deare short intermission bought with double smart. this knows my punisher; therefore as farr from granting hee, as i from begging peace: all hope excluded thus, behold in stead of us out-cast, exil'd, his new delight, mankind created, and for him this world. so farwel hope, and with hope farwel fear, farwel remorse: all good to me is lost; evil be thou my good; by thee at least divided empire with heav'ns king i hold by thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne; as man ere long, and this new world shall know. thus while he spake, each passion dimm'd his face thrice chang'd with pale, ire, envie and despair, which marrd his borrow'd visage, and betraid him counterfet, if any eye beheld. for heav'nly mindes from such distempers foule are ever cleer. whereof hee soon aware, each perturbation smooth'd with outward calme, artificer of fraud; and was the first that practisd falshood under saintly shew, deep malice to conceale, couch't with revenge: yet not anough had practisd to deceive uriel once warnd; whose eye pursu'd him down the way he went, and on th' assyrian mount saw him disfigur'd, more then could befall spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce he markd and mad demeanour, then alone, as he suppos'd, all unobserv'd, unseen. so on he fares, and to the border comes, of eden, where delicious paradise, now nearer, crowns with her enclosure green, as with a rural mound the champain head of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides with thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde, access deni'd; and over head up grew insuperable highth of loftiest shade, cedar, and pine, and firr, and branching palm, a silvan scene, and as the ranks ascend shade above shade, a woodie theatre of stateliest view. yet higher then thir tops the verdurous wall of paradise up sprung: which to our general sire gave prospect large into his neather empire neighbouring round. and higher then that wall a circling row of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit, blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt: on which the sun more glad impress'd his beams then in fair evening cloud, or humid bow, when god hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd that lantskip: and of pure now purer aire meets his approach, and to the heart inspires vernal delight and joy, able to drive all sadness but despair: now gentle gales fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole those balmie spoiles. as when to them who saile beyond the cape of hope, and now are past mozambic, off at sea north-east windes blow sabean odours from the spicie shoare of arabie the blest, with such delay well pleas'd they slack thir course, and many a league chear'd with the grateful smell old ocean smiles. so entertaind those odorous sweets the fiend who came thir bane, though with them better pleas'd then asmodeus with the fishie fume, that drove him, though enamourd, from the spouse of tobits son, and with a vengeance sent from media post to aegypt, there fast bound. now to th' ascent of that steep savage hill satan had journied on, pensive and slow; but further way found none, so thick entwin'd, as one continu'd brake, the undergrowth of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext all path of man or beast that past that way: one gate there only was, and that look'd east on th' other side: which when th' arch-fellon saw due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt, at one slight bound high over leap'd all bound of hill or highest wall, and sheer within lights on his feet. as when a prowling wolfe, whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, watching where shepherds pen thir flocks at eeve in hurdl'd cotes amid the field secure, leaps o're the fence with ease into the fould:. or as a thief bent to unhoord the cash of some rich burgher, whose substantial dores, cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault, in at the window climbs, or o're the tiles; so clomb this first grand thief into gods fould: so since into his church lewd hirelings climbe. thence up he flew, and on the tree of life, the middle tree and highest there that grew, sat like a cormorant; yet not true life thereby regaind, but sat devising death to them who liv'd; nor on the vertue thought of that life-giving plant, but only us'd for prospect, what well us'd had bin the pledge of immortality. so little knows any, but god alone, to value right the good before him, but perverts best things to worst abuse, or to thir meanest use. beneath him with new wonder now he views to all delight of human sense expos'd in narrow room natures whole wealth, yea more, a heav'n on earth, for blissful paradise of god the garden was, by him in the east of eden planted; eden stretchd her line from auran eastward to the royal towrs of great seleucia, built by grecian kings, or where the sons of eden long before dwelt in telassar: in this pleasant soile his farr more pleasant garden god ordaind; out of the fertil ground he caus'd to grow all trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; and all amid them stood the tree of life, high eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit of vegetable gold; and next to life our death the tree of knowledge grew fast by, knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill. southward through eden went a river large, nor chang'd his course, but through the shaggie hill pass'd underneath ingulft, for god had thrown that mountain as his garden mould high rais'd upon the rapid current, which through veins of porous earth with kindly thirst up drawn, rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill waterd the garden; thence united fell down the steep glade, and met the neather flood, which from his darksom passage now appeers, and now divided into four main streams, runs divers, wandring many a famous realme and country whereof here needs no account, but rather to tell how, if art could tell, how from that saphire fount the crisped brooks, rowling on orient pearl and sands of gold, with mazie error under pendant shades ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed flours worthy of paradise which not nice art in beds and curious knots, but nature boon powrd forth profuse on hill and dale and plaine, both where the morning sun first warmly smote the open field, and where the unpierc't shade lmbround the noontide bowrs: thus was this place, a happy rural seat of various view; groves whose rich trees wept odorous gumms and balme, others whose fruit burnisht with golden rinde hung amiable, hesperian fables true, if true, here only, and of delicious taste: betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks grasing the tender herb, were interpos'd, or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap of som irriguous valley spred her store, flours of all hue, and without thorn the rose: another side, umbrageous grots and caves of coole recess, o're which the mantling vine layes forth her purple grape, and gently creeps luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall down the slope hills, disperst, or in a lake, that to the fringed bank with myrtle crownd, her chrystal mirror holds, unite thir streams. the birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires, breathing the smell of field and grove, attune the trembling leaves, while universal pan knit with the graces and the hours in dance led on th' eternal spring. not that faire field of enna, where proserpin gathering flours her self a fairer floure by gloomie dis was gatherd, which cost ceres all that pain to seek her through the world; nor that sweet grove of daphne by orontes, and th' inspir'd castalian spring, might with this paradise of eden strive; nor that nyseian ile girt with the river triton, where old cham, whom gentiles ammon call and lybian jove, hid amalthea and her florid son young bacchus from his stepdame rhea's eye; nor where abassin kings thir issue guard, mount amara, though this by som suppos'd true paradise under the ethiop line by nilus head, enclosd with shining rock, a whole days journy high, but wide remote from this assyrian garden, where the fiend saw undelighted all delight, all kind of living creatures new to sight and strange: two of far nobler shape erect and tall, godlike erect, with native honour clad in naked majestie seemd lords of all, and worthie seemd, for in thir looks divine the image of thir glorious maker shon, truth, wisdome, sanctitude severe and pure, severe but in true filial freedom plac't; whence true autoritie in men; though both not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd; for contemplation hee and valour formd, for softness shee and sweet attractive grace, hee for god only, shee for god in him: his fair large front and eye sublime declar'd absolute rule; and hyacinthin locks round from his parted forelock manly hung clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad: shee as a vail down to the slender waste her unadorned golden tresses wore dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav'd as the vine curles her tendrils, which impli'd subjection, but requir'd with gentle sway, and by her yielded, by him best receivd, yielded with coy submission, modest pride, and sweet reluctant amorous delay. nor those mysterious parts were then conceald, then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame of natures works, honor dishonorable, sin-bred, how have ye troubl'd all mankind with shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure, and banisht from mans life his happiest life, simplicitie and spotless innocence. so passd they naked on, nor shund the sight of god or angel, for they thought no ill: so hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair that ever since in loves imbraces met, adam the goodliest man of men since borne his sons, the fairest of her daughters eve. under a tuft of shade that on a green stood whispering soft, by a fresh fountain side they sat them down, and after no more toil of thir sweet gardning labour then suffic'd to recommend coole zephyr, and made ease more easie, wholsom thirst and appetite more grateful, to thir supper fruits they fell, nectarine fruits which the compliant boughes yielded them, side-long as they sat recline on the soft downie bank damaskt with flours: the savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream; nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial league, alone as they. about them frisking playd all beasts of th' earth, since wilde, and of all chase in wood or wilderness, forrest or den; sporting the lion rampd, and in his paw dandl'd the kid; bears, tygers, ounces, pards, gambold before them, th' unwieldy elephant to make them mirth us'd all his might, and wreathd his lithe proboscis; close the serpent sly insinuating, wove with gordian twine his breaded train, and of his fatal guile gave proof unheeded; others on the grass coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat, or bedward ruminating: for the sun declin'd was hasting now with prone carreer to th' ocean iles, and in th' ascending scale of heav'n the starrs that usher evening rose: when satan still in gaze, as first he stood, scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad. o hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold, into our room of bliss thus high advanc't creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps, not spirits, yet to heav'nly spirits bright little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue with wonder, and could love, so lively shines in them divine resemblance, and such grace the hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd. ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh your change approaches, when all these delights will vanish and deliver ye to woe, more woe, the more your taste is now of joy; happie, but for so happie ill secur'd long to continue, and this high seat your heav'n ill fenc't for heav'n to keep out such a foe as now is enterd; yet no purpos'd foe to you whom i could pittie thus forlorne though i unpittied: league with you i seek, and mutual amitie so streight, so close, that i with you must dwell, or you with me henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please like this fair paradise, your sense, yet such accept your makers work; he gave it me, which i as freely give; hell shall unfold, to entertain you two, her widest gates, and send forth all her kings; there will be room, not like these narrow limits, to receive ass your numerous ofspring; if no better place, thank him who puts me loath to this revenge on you who wrong me not for him who wrongd. and should i at your harmless innocence melt, as i doe, yet public reason just, honour and empire with revenge enlarg'd, by conquering this new world, compels me now to do what else though damnd i should abhorre. so spake the fiend, and with necessitie, the tyrants plea, excus'd his devilish deeds. then from his loftie stand on that high tree down he alights among the sportful herd of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one, now other, as thir shape servd best his end neerer to view his prey, and unespi'd to mark what of thir state he more might learn by word or action markt: about them round a lion now he stalkes with fierie glare, then as a tyger, who by chance hath spi'd in some purlieu two gentle fawnes at play, strait couches close, then rising changes oft his couchant watch, as one who chose his ground whence rushing he might surest seize them both grip't in each paw: when adam first of men to first of women eve thus moving speech, turnd him all eare to hear new utterance flow. sole partner and sole part of all these joyes, dearer thy self then all; needs must the power that made us, and for us this ample world be infinitly good, and of his good as liberal and free as infinite, that rais'd us from the dust and plac't us here in all this happiness, who at his hand have nothing merited, nor can performe aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires from us no other service then to keep this one, this easie charge, of all the trees in paradise that bear delicious fruit so various, not to taste that onely tree of knowledge, planted by the tree of life, so neer grows death to life, what ere death is, som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst god hath pronounc't it death to taste that tree, the only sign of our obedience left among so many signes of power and rule conferrd upon us, and dominion giv'n over all other creatures that possess earth, aire, and sea. then let us not think hard one easie prohibition, who enjoy free leave so large to all things else, and choice unlimited of manifold delights: but let us ever praise him, and extoll his bountie, following our delightful task to prune these growing plants, and tend these flours, which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet. to whom thus eve repli'd. o thou for whom and from whom i was formd flesh of thy flesh, and without whom am to no end, my guide and head, what thou hast said is just and right. for wee to him indeed all praises owe, and daily thanks, i chiefly who enjoy so farr the happier lot, enjoying thee praeeminent by so much odds, while thou like consort to thy self canst no where find. that day i oft remember, when from sleep i first awak't, and found my self repos'd under a shade of flours, much wondring where and what i was, whence thither brought, and how. not distant far from thence a murmuring sound of waters issu'd from a cave and spread into a liquid plain, then stood unmov'd pure as th' expanse of heav'n; i thither went with unexperienc't thought, and laid me downe on the green bank, to look into the cleer smooth lake, that to me seemd another skie. as i bent down to look, just opposite, a shape within the watry gleam appeerd bending to look on me, i started back, it started back, but pleas'd i soon returnd, pleas'd it returnd as soon with answering looks of sympathie and love; there i had fixt mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire, had not a voice thus warnd me, what thou seest, what there thou seest fair creature is thy self, with thee it came and goes: but follow me, and i will bring thee where no shadow staies thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare multitudes like thy self, and thence be call'd mother of human race: what could i doe, but follow strait, invisibly thus led? till i espi'd thee, fair indeed and tall, under a platan, yet methought less faire, less winning soft, less amiablie milde, then that smooth watry image; back i turnd, thou following cryd'st aloud, return faire eve, whom fli'st thou? whom thou fli'st, of him thou art, his flesh, his bone; to give thee being i lent out of my side to thee, neerest my heart substantial life, to have thee by my side henceforth an individual solace dear; part of my soul i seek thee, and thee claim my other half: with that thy gentle hand seisd mine, i yielded, and from that time see how beauty is excelld by manly grace and wisdom, which alone is truly fair. so spake our general mother, and with eyes of conjugal attraction unreprov'd, and meek surrender, half imbracing leand on our first father, half her swelling breast naked met his under the flowing gold of her loose tresses hid: he in delight both of her beauty and submissive charms smil'd with superior love, as jupiter on juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds that shed may flowers; and press'd her matron lip with kisses pure: aside the devil turnd for envie, yet with jealous leer maligne ey'd them askance, and to himself thus plaind. sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two imparadis't in one anothers arms the happier eden, shall enjoy thir fill of bliss on bliss, while i to hell am thrust, where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire, among our other torments not the least, still unfulfill'd with pain of longing pines; yet let me not forget what i have gain'd from thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems: one fatal tree there stands of knowledge call'd, forbidden them to taste: knowledge forbidd'n? suspicious, reasonless. why should thir lord envie them that? can it be sin to know, can it be death? and do they onely stand by ignorance, is that thir happie state, the proof of thir obedience and thir faith? o fair foundation laid whereon to build thir ruine! hence i will excite thir minds with more desire to know, and to reject envious commands, invented with designe to keep them low whom knowledge might exalt equal with gods; aspiring to be such, they taste and die: what likelier can ensue? but first with narrow search i must walk round this garden, and no corner leave unspi'd; a chance but chance may lead where i may meet some wandring spirit of heav'n, by fountain side, or in thick shade retir'd, from him to draw what further would be learnt. live while ye may, yet happie pair; enjoy, till i return, short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed. so saying, his proud step he scornful turn'd, but with sly circumspection, and began through wood, through waste, o're hill, o're dale his roam. mean while in utmost longitude, where heav'n with earth and ocean meets, the setting sun slowly descended, and with right aspect against the eastern gate of paradise leveld his eevning rayes: it was a rock of alablaster, pil'd up to the clouds, conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent accessible from earth, one entrance high; the rest was craggie cliff, that overhung still as it rose, impossible to climbe. betwixt these rockie pillars gabriel sat chief of th' angelic guards, awaiting night; about him exercis'd heroic games th' unarmed youth of heav'n, but nigh at hand celestial armourie, shields, helmes, and speares, hung high with diamond flaming, and with gold. thither came uriel, gliding through the eeven on a sun beam, swift as a shooting starr in autumn thwarts the night, when vapors fir'd impress the air, and shews the mariner from what point of his compass to beware impetuous winds: he thus began in haste. gabriel, to thee thy course by lot hath giv'n charge and strict watch that to this happie place no evil thing approach or enter in; this day at highth of noon came to my spheare a spirit, zealous, as he seem'd, to know more of th' almighties works, and chiefly man gods latest image: i describ'd his way bent all on speed, and markt his aerie gate; but in the mount that lies from eden north, where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks alien from heav'n, with passions foul obscur'd: mine eye pursu'd him still, but under shade lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew i fear, hath ventur'd from the deep, to raise new troubles; him thy care must be to find. to whom the winged warriour thus returnd: uriel, no wonder if thy perfet sight, amid the suns bright circle where thou sitst, see farr and wide: in at this gate none pass the vigilance here plac't, but such as come well known from heav'n; and since meridian hour no creature thence: if spirit of other sort, so minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds on purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude spiritual substance with corporeal barr. but if within the circuit of these walks, in whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom thou tellst, by morrow dawning i shall know. so promis'd hee, and uriel to his charge returnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd bore him slope downward to the sun now fall'n beneath th' azores; whither the prime orb, incredible how swift, had thither rowl'd diurnal, or this less volubil earth by shorter flight to th' east, had left him there arraying with reflected purple and gold the clouds that on his western throne attend: now came still eevning on, and twilight gray had in her sober liverie all things clad; silence accompanied, for beast and bird, they to thir grassie couch, these to thir nests were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale; she all night long her amorous descant sung; silence was pleas'd: now glow'd the firmament with living saphirs: hesperus that led the starrie host, rode brightest, till the moon rising in clouded majestie, at length apparent queen unvaild her peerless light, and o're the dark her silver mantle threw. when adam thus to eve: fair consort, th' hour of night, and all things now retir'd to rest mind us of like repose, since god hath set labour and rest, as day and night to men successive, and the timely dew of sleep now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines our eye-lids; other creatures all day long rove idle unimploid, and less need rest; man hath his daily work of body or mind appointed, which declares his dignitie, and the regard of heav'n on all his waies; while other animals unactive range, and of thir doings god takes no account. to morrow ere fresh morning streak the east with first approach of light, we must be ris'n, and at our pleasant labour, to reform yon flourie arbors, yonder allies green, our walk at noon, with branches overgrown, that mock our scant manuring, and require more hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth: those blossoms also, and those dropping gumms, that lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth, ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease; mean while, as nature wills, night bids us rest. to whom thus eve with perfet beauty adornd. my author and disposer, what thou bidst unargu'd i obey; so god ordains, god is thy law, thou mine: to know no more is womans happiest knowledge and her praise. with thee conversing i forget all time, all seasons and thir change, all please alike. sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet, with charm of earliest birds; pleasant the sun when first on this delightful land he spreads his orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour, glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth after soft showers; and sweet the coming on of grateful eevning milde, then silent night with this her solemn bird and this fair moon, and these the gemms of heav'n, her starrie train: but neither breath of morn when she ascends with charm of earliest birds, nor rising sun on this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure, glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers, nor grateful eevning mild, nor silent night with this her solemn bird, nor walk by moon, or glittering starr-light without thee is sweet. but wherfore all night long shine these, for whom this glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes? to whom our general ancestor repli'd. daughter of god and man, accomplisht eve, those have thir course to finish, round the earth, by morrow eevning, and from land to land in order, though to nations yet unborn, ministring light prepar'd, they set and rise; least total darkness should by night regaine her old possession, and extinguish life in nature and all things, which these soft fires not only enlighten, but with kindly heate of various influence foment and warme, temper or nourish, or in part shed down thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow on earth, made hereby apter to receive perfection from the suns more potent ray. these then, though unbeheld in deep of night, shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none, that heav'n would want spectators, god want praise; millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:. all these with ceasless praise his works behold both day and night: how often from the steep of echoing hill or thicket have we heard celestial voices to the midnight air, sole, or responsive each to others note singing thir great creator: oft in bands while they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk with heav'nly touch of instrumental sounds in full harmonic number joind, thir songs divide the night, and lift our thoughts to heaven. thus talking hand in hand alone they pass'd on to thir blissful bower; it was a place chos'n by the sovran planter, when he fram'd all things to mans delightful use; the roofe of thickest covert was inwoven shade laurel and mirtle, and what higher grew of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side acanthus, and each odorous bushie shrub fenc'd up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour, iris all hues, roses, and gessamin rear'd high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought mosaic; underfoot the violet, crocus, and hyacinth with rich inlay broiderd the ground, more colour'd then with stone of costliest emblem: other creature here beast, bird, insect, or worm durst enter none; such was thir awe of man. in shadie bower more sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd, pan or silvanus never slept, nor nymph, nor faunus haunted. here in close recess with flowers, garlands, and sweet-smelling herbs espoused eve deckt first her nuptial bed, and heav'nly quires the hymenaean sung, what day the genial angel to our sire brought her in naked beauty more adorn'd, more lovely then pandora, whom the gods endowd with all thir gifts, and o too like in sad event, when to the unwiser son of japhet brought by hermes, she ensnar'd mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng'd on him who had stole joves authentic fire. thus at thir shadie lodge arriv'd, both stood both turnd, and under op'n skie ador'd the god that made both skie, air, earth and heav'n which they beheld, the moons resplendent globe and starrie pole: thou also mad'st the night, maker omnipotent, and thou the day, which we in our appointed work imployd have finisht happie in our mutual help and mutual love, the crown of all our bliss ordaind by thee, and this delicious place for us too large, where thy abundance wants partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground. but thou hast promis'd from us two a race to fill the earth, who shall with us extoll thy goodness infinite, both when we wake, and when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep. this said unanimous, and other rites observing none, but adoration pure which god likes best, into thir inmost bowre handed they went; and eas'd the putting off these troublesom disguises which wee wear, strait side by side were laid, nor turnd i weene adam from his fair spouse, nor eve the rites mysterious of connubial love refus'd: whatever hypocrites austerely talk of puritie and place and innocence, defaming as impure what god declares pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all. our maker bids increase, who bids abstain but our destroyer, foe to god and man? haile wedded love, mysterious law, true source of human ofspring, sole proprietie, in paradise of all things common else. by thee adulterous lust was driv'n from men among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee founded in reason, loyal, just, and pure, relations dear, and all the charities of father, son, and brother first were known. farr be it, that i should write thee sin or blame, or think thee unbefitting holiest place, perpetual fountain of domestic sweets, whose bed is undefil'd and chaste pronounc't, present, or past, as saints and patriarchs us'd. here love his golden shafts imploies, here lights his constant lamp, and waves his purple wings, reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile of harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard, casual fruition, nor in court amours mixt dance, or wanton mask, or midnight bal, or serenate, which the starv'd lover sings to his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. these lulld by nightingales imbraceing slept, and on thir naked limbs the flourie roof showrd roses, which the morn repair'd. sleep on blest pair; and o yet happiest if ye seek no happier state, and know to know no more. now had night measur'd with her shaddowie cone half way up hill this vast sublunar vault, and from thir ivorie port the cherubim forth issuing at th' accustomd hour stood armd to thir night watches in warlike parade, when gabriel to his next in power thus spake. uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the south with strictest watch; these other wheel the north, our circuit meets full west. as flame they part half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear. from these, two strong and suttle spirits he calld that neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge. ithuriel and zephon, with wingd speed search through this garden, leave unsearcht no nook, but chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge, now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme. this eevning from the sun's decline arriv'd who tells of som infernal spirit seen hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap'd the barrs of hell, on errand bad no doubt: such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. so saying, on he led his radiant files, daz'ling the moon; these to the bower direct in search of whom they sought: him there they found squat like a toad, close at the eare of eve; assaying by his devilish art to reach the organs of her fancie, and with them forge illusions as he list, phantasms and dreams, or if, inspiring venom, he might taint th' animal spirits that from pure blood arise like gentle breaths from rivers pure, thence raise at least distemperd, discontented thoughts, vaine hopes, vaine aimes, inordinate desires blown up with high conceits ingendring pride. him thus intent ithuriel with his spear touch'd lightly; for no falshood can endure touch of celestial temper, but returns of force to its own likeness: up he starts discoverd and surpriz'd. as when a spark lights on a heap of nitrous powder, laid fit for the tun som magazin to store against a rumord warr, the smuttie graine with sudden blaze diffus'd, inflames the aire: so started up in his own shape the fiend. back stept those two faire angels half amaz'd so sudden to behold the grieslie king; yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon. which of those rebell spirits adjudg'd to hell com'st thou, escap'd thy prison, and transform'd, why satst thou like an enemie in waite here watching at the head of these that sleep? know ye not then said satan, fill'd with scorn, know ye not mee? ye knew me once no mate for you, there sitting where ye durst not soare; not to know mee argues your selves unknown, the lowest of your throng; or if ye know, why ask ye, and superfluous begin your message, like to end as much in vain? to whom thus zephon, answering scorn with scorn. think not, revolted spirit, thy shape the same, or undiminisht brightness, to be known as when thou stoodst in heav'n upright and pure; that glorie then, when thou no more wast good, departed from thee, and thou resembl'st now thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule. but come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account to him who sent us, whose charge is to keep this place inviolable, and these from harm. so spake the cherube, and his grave rebuke severe in youthful beautie, added grace invincible: abasht the devil stood, and felt how awful goodness is, and saw vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin'd his loss; but chiefly to find here observd his lustre visibly impar'd; yet seemd undaunted. if i must contend, said he, best with the best, the sender not the sent, or all at once; more glorie will be wonn, or less be lost. thy fear, said zephon bold, will save us trial what the least can doe single against thee wicked, and thence weak. the fiend repli'd not, overcome with rage; but like a proud steed reind, went hautie on, chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie he held it vain; awe from above had quelld his heart, not else dismai'd. now drew they nigh the western point, where those half-rounding guard just met, and closing stood in squadron joind awaiting next command. to whom thir chief gabriel from the front thus calld aloud. o friends, i hear the tread of nimble feet hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne ithuriel and zephon through the shade, and with them comes a third of regal port, but faded splendor wan; who by his gate and fierce demeanour seems the prince of hell, not likely to part hence without contest; stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. he scarce had ended, when those two approachd and brief related whom they brought, where found, how busied, in what form and posture coucht. to whom with stern regard thus gabriel spake. why hast thou, satan broke the bounds prescrib'd to thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge of others, who approve not to transgress by thy example, but have power and right to question thy bold entrance on this place; imploi'd it seems to violate sleep, and those whose dwelling god hath planted here in bliss? to whom thus satan, with contemptuous brow. gabriel, thou hadst in heav'n th' esteem of wise, and such i held thee; but this question askt puts me in doubt. lives ther who loves his pain? who would not, finding way, break loose from hell, though thither doomd? thou wouldst thy self, no doubt, and boldly venture to whatever place farthest from pain, where thou mightest hope to change torment with ease, and soonest recompence dole with delight, which in this place i sought; to thee no reason; who knowst only good, but evil hast not tri'd: and wilt object his will who bound us? let him surer barr his iron gates, if he intends our stay in that dark durance: thus much what was askt. the rest is true, they found me where they say; but that implies not violence or harme. thus he in scorn.the warlike angel mov'd, disdainfully half smiling thus repli'd. o loss of one in heav'n to judge of wise, since satan fell, whom follie overthrew, and now returns him from his prison scap't, gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither unlicenc't from his bounds in hell prescrib'd; so wise he judges it to fly from pain however, and to scape his punishment. so judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth, which thou incurr'st by flying, meet thy flight seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to hell, which taught thee yet no better, that no pain can equal anger infinite provok't. but wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee came not all hell broke loose? is pain to them less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they less hardie to endure? courageous chief, the first in flight from pain, had'st thou alledg'd to thy deserted host this cause of flight, thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. to which the fiend thus answerd frowning stern. not that i less endure, or shrink from pain, insulting angel, well thou knowst i stood thy fiercest, when in battel to thy aide thy blasting volied thunder made all speed and seconded thy else not dreaded spear. but still thy words at random, as before, argue thy inexperience what behooves from hard assaies and ill successes past a faithful leader, not to hazard all through wayes of danger by himself untri'd. i therefore, i alone first undertook to wing the desolate abyss, and spie this new created world, whereof in hell fame is not silent, here in hope to find better abode, and my afflicted powers to settle here on earth, or in mid aire; though for possession put to try once more what thou and thy gay legions dare against; whose easier business were to serve thir lord high up in heav'n, with songs to hymne his throne, and practis'd distances to cringe, not fight. to whom the warriour angel, soon repli'd. to say and strait unsay, pretending first wise to flie pain, professing next the spie, argues no leader but a lyar trac't, satan, and couldst thou faithful add? o name, o sacred name of faithfulness profan'd! faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? armie of fiends, fit body to fit head; was this your discipline and faith ingag'd, your military obedience, to dissolve allegeance to th' acknowldg'd power supream? and thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem patron of liberty, who more then thou once fawn'd, and cring'd, and servilly ador'd heav'ns awful monarch? wherefore but in hope to dispossess him, and thy self to reigne? but mark what i arreede thee now, avant;

the latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam; which gabriel spying, thus bespake the fiend. satan, i know thy strength, and thou knowst mine, neither our own but giv'n; what follie then to boast what arms can doe, since thine no more then heav'n permits, nor mine, though doubld now to trample thee as mire: for proof look up, and read thy lot in yon celestial sign where thou art weigh'd, and shown how light, how weak, if thou resist. the fiend lookt up and knew his mounted scale aloft: nor more;

(taint what it used to be) ... all alone and feeling ... operators are on duty. call now.as dry as a bubble, as expectant as the dead of night. without product placement, poetry as we know it cannot sur- vive. poetry should not be in the service of art any more than religion, ideology, or morality. poetry should be in the service of nothing — and not even that. if you can identify someone as gnostic they are probably notgnostic enough, for my money. i believe in my disbelief, have faith in my reason. the sacred in a poem is nowhere seen and everywhere felt. there’s more to transgression than ritual, but not enoughmore. there is more to liturgy than doctrine, once in a blue m- oo- n.i left my purpose in my other pants. you’re not the only paddle in the ocean, shadow in the dark, line in the poem, lobster in the trap, pot on the stove, wheel on the truck, letter on the keypad, scythe in the field, lever on the controls, cloud in the sky, fruit in the tree, rat in the lab. reality is usually a poor copy of the imitation. the original is an echo of what is yet to be. time is neither linear nor circular; it is excremental. beauty is the memory of the loss of time. memory is the reflection of the loss of beauty. american poetry suffers from its lack of uncreativity. i have no faith in faith, or hope for hope, no belief in belief, no doubt of doubt. they say god is in the details. that’s because the devil has the rest covered.god is weak and imaginary — a flickering possibility. the dogma of an omniscient and omnipotent god maligns hope and denies the sacred, as it turns its back on the world. god has no doctrine, no morality, no responsibility. to sin against god is to use that name to justify any action or prohibition, whether murder or martyrdom.i’ve got authenticity, you’ve got dogma ... proclaimeth the lord. saying one more time: it’s true but i don’t believe it i believe it but it’s not so. “my logic is all in the melting pot.” [wittgenstein]better an old cow than a dead horse. alzheimer’s: what’s that again? so it turns out i’m not a bull in a china shop but china in a bulls’ shop. sometimes a penis is just a s- y- m- b- ol.in their gloom, the jews go and cometalking of bergen-belsen.

vii hast thou found any likeness for thy vision? o gardener of strange flowers, what bud, what bloom, hast thou found sown, what gathered in the gloom? what of despair, of rapture, of derision, what of life is there, what of ill or good? are the fruits grey like dust or bright like blood? does the dim ground grow any seed of ours, the faint fields quicken any terrene root, in low lands where the sun and moon are mute and all the stars keep silence? are there flowers at all, or any fruit? viii alas, but though my flying song flies after, o sweet strange elder singer, thy more fleet singing, and footprints of thy fleeter feet, some dim derision of mysterious laughter from the blind tongueless warders of the dead, some gainless glimpse of proserpine's veiled head, some little sound of unregarded tears wept by effaced unprofitable eyes, and from pale mouths some cadence of dead sighs — these only, these the hearkening spirit hears, sees only such things rise. ix thou art far too far for wings of words to follow, far too far off for thought or any prayer. what ails us with thee, who art wind and air? what ails us gazing where all seen is hollow? yet with some fancy, yet with some desire, dreams pursue death as winds a flying fire, our dreams pursue our dead and do not find. still, and more swift than they, the thin flame flies, the low light fails us in elusive skies, still the foiled earnest ear is deaf, and blind are still the eluded eyes. x not thee, o never thee, in all time's changes, not thee, but this the sound of thy sad soul, the shadow of thy swift spirit, this shut scroll i lay my hand on, and not death estranges my spirit from communion of thy song — these memories and these melodies that throng veiled porches of a muse funereal — these i salute, these touch, these clasp and fold as though a hand were in my hand to hold, or through mine ears a mourning musical of many mourners rolled. xi i among these, i also, in such station as when the pyre was charred, and piled the sods, and offering to the dead made, and their gods, the old mourners had, standing to make libation, i stand, and to the gods and to the dead do reverence without prayer or praise, and shed offering to these unknown, the gods of gloom, and what of honey and spice my seedlands bear, and what i may of fruits in this chilled air, and lay, orestes-like, across the tomb a curl of severed hair. xii but by no hand nor any treason stricken, not like the low-lying head of him, the king, the flame that made of troy a ruinous thing, thou liest, and on this dust no tears could quicken there fall no tears like theirs that all men hear fall tear by sweet imperishable tear down the opening leaves of holy poets' pages. thee not orestes, not electra mourns; but bending us-ward with memorial urns the most high muses that fulfil all ages weep, and our god's heart yearns. xiii for, sparing of his sacred strength, not often among us darkling here the lord of light makes manifest his music and his might in hearts that open and in lips that soften with the soft flame and heat of songs that shine. thy lips indeed he touched with bitter wine, and nourished them indeed with bitter bread; yet surely from his hand thy soul's food came, the fire that scarred thy spirit at his flame was lighted, and thine hungering heart he fed who feeds our hearts with fame. xiv therefore he too now at thy soul's sunsetting, god of all suns and songs, he too bends down to mix his laurel with thy cypress crown, and save thy dust from blame and from forgetting. therefore he too, seeing all thou wert and art, compassionate, with sad and sacred heart, mourns thee of many his children the last dead, and hallows with strange tears and alien sighs thine unmelodious mouth and sunless eyes, and over thine irrevocable head sheds light from the under skies. xv and one weeps with him in the ways lethean, and stains with tears her changing bosom chill: that obscure venus of the hollow hill, that thing transformed which was the cytherean, with lips that lost their grecian laugh divine long since, and face no more called erycine; a ghost, a bitter and luxurious god. thee also with fair flesh and singing spell did she, a sad and second prey, compel into the footless places once more trod, and shadows hot from hell. xvi and now no sacred staff shall break in blossom, no choral salutation lure to light a spirit sick with perfume and sweet night and love's tired eyes and hands and barren bosom. there is no help for these things; none to mend and none to mar; not all our songs, o friend, will make death clear or make life durable. howbeit with rose and ivy and wild vine and with wild notes about this dust of thine at least i fill the place where white dreams dwell and wreathe an unseen shrine. xvii sleep; and if life was bitter to thee, pardon, if sweet, give thanks; thou hast no more to live; and to give thanks is good, and to forgive. out of the mystic and the mournful garden where all day through thine hands in barren braid wove the sick flowers of secrecy and shade, green buds of sorrow and sin, and remnants grey, sweet-smelling, pale with poison, sanguine-hearted, passions that sprang from sleep and thoughts that started, shall death not bring us all as thee one day among the days departed?

12734,9285,"<line> <line>farewell (sweet cooke-ham) where i first obtained grace from that grace where perfect grace remained; and where the muses gave their full consent, i should have power the virtuous to content; where princely palace willed me to indite, the sacred story of the soul’s delight. farewell (sweet place) where virtue then did rest, and all delights did harbor in her breast; never shall my sad eyes again behold those pleasures which my thoughts did then unfold. yet you (great lady) mistress of that place, from whose desires did spring this work of grace; vouchsafe to think upon those pleasures past, as fleeting worldly joys that could not last, or, as dim shadows of celestial pleasures, which are desired above all earthly treasures. oh how (methought) against you thither came, each part did seem some new delight to frame! the house received all ornaments to grace it, and would endure no foulness to deface it. and walks put on their summer liveries, and all things else did hold like similes. the trees with leaves, with fruits, with flowers clad, embraced each other, seeming to be glad, turning themselves to beauteous canopies, to shade the bright sun from your brighter eyes; the crystal streams with silver spangles graced, while by the glorious sun they were embraced; the little birds in chirping notes did sing, to entertain both you and that sweet spring. and philomela with her sundry lays, both you and that delightful place did praise. oh how me thought each plant, each flower, each tree set forth their beauties then to welcome thee! the very hills right humbly did descend, when you to tread on them did intend. and as you set your feet, they still did rise, glad that they could receive so rich a prize. the gentle winds did take delight to be among those woods that were so graced by thee, and in sad murmur uttered pleasing sound, that pleasure in that place might more abound. the swelling banks delivered all their pride when such a phoenix once they had espied. each arbor, bank, each seat, each stately tree, thought themselves honored in supporting thee; the pretty birds would oft come to attend thee, yet fly away for fear they should offend thee; the little creatures in the burrough by would come abroad to sport them in your eye, yet fearful of the bow in your fair hand. would run away when you did make a stand. now let me come unto that stately tree, wherein such goodly prospects you did see; that oak that did in height his fellows pass, as much as lofty trees, low growing grass, much like a comely cedar straight and tall, whose beauteous stature far exceeded all. how often did you visit this fair tree, which seeming joyful in receiving thee, would like a palm tree spread his arms abroad, desirous that you there should make abode; whose fair green leaves much like a comely veil, defended phoebus when he would assail; whose pleasing boughs did yield a cool fresh air, joying his happiness when you were there. where being seated, you might plainly see hills, vales, and woods, as if on bended knee they had appeared, your honor to salute, or to prefer some strange unlooked-for suit; all interlaced with brooks and crystal springs, a prospect fit to please the eyes of kings. and thirteen shires appeared all in your sight, europe could not afford much more delight. what was there then but gave you all content, while you the time in meditation spent of their creator’s power, which there you saw, in all his creatures held a perfect law; and in their beauties did you plain descry his beauty, wisdom, grace, love, majesty. in these sweet woods how often did you walk, with christ and his apostles there to talk; placing his holy writ in some fair tree to meditate what you therein did see. with moses you did mount his holy hill to know his pleasure, and perform his will. with lowly david you did often sing his holy hymns to heaven’s eternal king. and in sweet music did your soul delight to sound his praises, morning, noon, and night. with blessed joseph you did often feed your pined brethren, when they stood in need. and that sweet lady sprung from clifford’s race, of noble bedford’s blood, fair stem of grace, to honorable dorset now espoused, in whose fair breast true virtue then was housed, oh what delight did my weak spirits find in those pure parts of her well framèd mind. and yet it grieves me that i cannot be near unto her, whose virtues did agree with those fair ornaments of outward beauty, which did enforce from all both love and duty. unconstant fortune, thou art most to blame, who casts us down into so low a frame where our great friends we cannot daily see, so great a difference is there in degree. many are placed in those orbs of state, partners in honor, so ordained by fate, nearer in show, yet farther off in love, in which, the lowest always are above. but whither am i carried in conceit, my wit too weak to conster of the great. why not? although we are but born of earth, we may behold the heavens, despising death; and loving heaven that is so far above, may in the end vouchsafe us entire love. therefore sweet memory do thou retain those pleasures past, which will not turn again: remember beauteous dorset’s former sports, so far from being touched by ill reports, wherein myself did always bear a part, while reverend love presented my true heart. those recreations let me bear in mind, which her sweet youth and noble thoughts did find, whereof deprived, i evermore must grieve, hating blind fortune, careless to relieve, and you sweet cooke-ham, whom these ladies leave, i now must tell the grief you did conceive at their departure, when they went away, how everything retained a sad dismay. nay long before, when once an inkling came, methought each thing did unto sorrow frame: the trees that were so glorious in our view, forsook both flowers and fruit, when once they knew of your depart, their very leaves did wither, changing their colors as they grew together. but when they saw this had no power to stay you, they often wept, though, speechless, could not pray you, letting their tears in your fair bosoms fall, as if they said, why will ye leave us all? this being vain, they cast their leaves away hoping that pity would have made you stay: their frozen tops, like age’s hoary hairs, shows their disasters, languishing in fears. a swarthy riveled rind all over spread, their dying bodies half alive, half dead. but your occasions called you so away that nothing there had power to make you stay. yet did i see a noble grateful mind requiting each according to their kind, forgetting not to turn and take your leave of these sad creatures, powerless to receive your favor, when with grief you did depart, placing their former pleasures in your heart, giving great charge to noble memory there to preserve their love continually. but specially the love of that fair tree, that first and last you did vouchsafe to see, in which it pleased you oft to take the air with noble dorset, then a virgin fair, where many a learned book was read and scanned, to this fair tree, taking me by the hand, you did repeat the pleasures which had passed, seeming to grieve they could no longer last. and with a chaste, yet loving kiss took leave, of which sweet kiss i did it soon bereave, scorning a senseless creature should possess so rare a favor, so great happiness. no other kiss it could receive from me, for fear to give back what it took of thee, so i ungrateful creature did deceive it of that which you in love vouchsafed to leave it. and though it oft had given me much content, yet this great wrong i never could repent; but of the happiest made it most forlorn, to show that nothing’s free from fortune’s scorne, while all the rest with this most beauteous tree made their sad consort sorrow’s harmony. the flowers that on the banks and walks did grow, crept in the ground, the grass did weep for woe. the winds and waters seemed to chide together because you went away they knew not whither; and those sweet brooks that ran so fair and clear, with grief and trouble wrinkled did appear. those pretty birds that wonted were to sing, now neither sing, nor chirp, nor use their wing, but with their tender feet on some bare spray, warble forth sorrow, and their own dismay. fair philomela leaves her mournful ditty, drowned in deep sleep, yet can procure no pity. each arbor, bank, each seat, each stately tree looks bare and desolate now for want of thee, turning green tresses into frosty gray, while in cold grief they wither all away. the sun grew weak, his beams no comfort gave, while all green things did make the earth their grave. each brier, each bramble, when you went away caught fast your clothes, thinking to make you stay; delightful echo wonted to reply to our last words, did now for sorrow die; the house cast off each garment that might grace it, putting on dust and cobwebs to deface it. all desolation then there did appear, when you were going whom they held so dear. this last farewell to cooke-ham here i give, when i am dead thy name in this may live, wherein i have performed her noble hest whose virtues lodge in my unworthy breast, and ever shall, so long as life remains, tying my life to her by those rich chains. <line>","living,time & brevity,activities,eating & drinking,relationships,home life,religion,christianity"

<line>some kill their love when they are young, <line> <line> and some when they are old; <line>some strangle with the hands of lust, <line> <line> some with the hands of gold: <line>the kindest use a knife, because <line> <line> the dead so soon grow cold. <line>some love too little, some too long, <line> <line> some sell, and others buy; <line>some do the deed with many tears, <line> <line> and some without a sigh: <line>for each man kills the thing he loves, <line> <line> yet each man does not die. <line>he does not die a death of shame <line> <line> on a day of dark disgrace, <line>nor have a noose about his neck, <line> <line> nor a cloth upon his face, <line>nor drop feet foremost through the floor <line> <line> into an empty space. <line>he does not sit with silent men <line> <line> who watch him night and day; <line>who watch him when he tries to weep, <line> <line> and when he tries to pray; <line>who watch him lest himself should rob <line> <line> the prison of its prey. <line>he does not wake at dawn to see <line> <line> dread figures throng his room, <line>the shivering chaplain robed in white, <line> <line> the sheriff stern with gloom, <line>and the governor all in shiny black, <line> <line> with the yellow face of doom. <line>he does not rise in piteous haste <line> <line> to put on convict-clothes, <line>while some coarse-mouthed doctor gloats, and notes <line> <line> each new and nerve-twitched pose, <line>fingering a watch whose little ticks <line> <line> are like horrible hammer-blows. <line>he does not know that sickening thirst <line> <line> that sands one's throat, before <line>the hangman with his gardener's gloves <line> <line> slips through the padded door, <line>and binds one with three leathern thongs, <line>that the throat may thirst no more. <line>he does not bend his head to hear <line> <line> the burial office read, <line>nor while the terror of his soul <line> <line> tells him he is not dead, <line>cross his own coffin, as he moves <line> <line> into the hideous shed. <line>he does not stare upon the air <line> <line> through a little roof of glass: <line>he does not pray with lips of clay <line> <line> for his agony to pass; <line>nor feel upon his shuddering cheek <line> <line> the kiss of caiaphas. <line>ii six weeks the guardsman walked the yard, <line> <line> in the suit of shabby gray: <line>his cricket cap was on his head, <line> <line> and his step seemed light and gay, <line>but i never saw a man who looked <line> <line> so wistfully at the day. <line>i never saw a man who looked <line> <line> with such a wistful eye <line>upon that little tent of blue <line> <line> which prisoners call the sky, <line>and at every wandering cloud that trailed <line> <line> its ravelled fleeces by. <line>he did not wring his hands, as do <line> <line> those witless men who dare <line>to try to rear the changeling hope <line> <line> in the cave of black despair: <line>he only looked upon the sun, <line> <line> and drank the morning air. <line>he did not wring his hands nor weep, <line> <line> nor did he peek or pine, <line>but he drank the air as though it held <line> <line> some healthful anodyne; <line>with open mouth he drank the sun <line> <line> as though it had been wine! <line>and i and all the souls in pain, <line> <line> who tramped the other ring, <line>forgot if we ourselves had done <line> <line> a great or little thing, <line>and watched with gaze of dull amaze <line> <line> the man who had to swing. <line>for strange it was to see him pass <line> <line> with a step so light and gay, <line>and strange it was to see him look <line> <line> so wistfully at the day, <line>and strange it was to think that he <line> <line> had such a debt to pay. <line>for oak and elm have pleasant leaves <line> <line> that in the spring-time shoot: <line>but grim to see is the gallows-tree, <line> <line> with its alder-bitten root, <line>and, green or dry, a man must die <line> <line> before it bears its fruit! <line>the loftiest place is that seat of grace <line> <line> for which all worldlings try: <line>but who would stand in hempen band <line> <line> upon a scaffold high, <line>and through a murderer's collar take <line> <line> his last look at the sky? <line>it is sweet to dance to violins <line> <line> when love and life are fair: <line>to dance to flutes, to dance to lutes <line> <line> is delicate and rare: <line>but it is not sweet with nimble feet <line> <line> to dance upon the air! <line>so with curious eyes and sick surmise <line> <line> we watched him day by day, <line>and wondered if each one of us <line> <line> would end the self-same way, <line>for none can tell to what red hell <line> <line> his sightless soul may stray. <line>at last the dead man walked no more <line> <line> amongst the trial men, <line>and i knew that he was standing up <line> <line> in the black dock's dreadful pen, <line>and that never would i see his face <line> <line> in god's sweet world again. <line>like two doomed ships that pass in storm <line> <line> we had crossed each other's way: <line>but we made no sign, we said no word, <line> <line> we had no word to say; <line>for we did not meet in the holy night, <line> <line> but in the shameful day. <line>a prison wall was round us both, <line> <line> two outcast men we were: <line>the world had thrust us from its heart, <line> <line> and god from out his care: <line>and the iron gin that waits for sin <line> <line> had caught us in its snare. <line>iii in debtors' yard the stones are hard, <line> <line> and the dripping wall is high, <line>so it was there he took the air <line> <line> beneath the leaden sky, <line>and by each side a warder walked, <line> <line> for fear the man might die. <line>or else he sat with those who watched <line> <line> his anguish night and day; <line>who watched him when he rose to weep, <line> <line> and when he crouched to pray; <line>who watched him lest himself should rob <line> <line> their scaffold of its prey. <line>the governor was strong upon <line> <line> the regulations act: <line>the doctor said that death was but <line> <line> a scientific fact: <line>and twice a day the chaplain called, <line> <line> and left a little tract. <line>and twice a day he smoked his pipe, <line> <line> and drank his quart of beer: <line>his soul was resolute, and held <line> <line> no hiding-place for fear; <line>he often said that he was glad <line> <line> the hangman's hands were near. <line>but why he said so strange a thing <line> <line> no warder dared to ask: <line>for he to whom a watcher's doom <line> <line> is given as his task, <line>must set a lock upon his lips, <line> <line> and make his face a mask. <line>or else he might be moved, and try <line> <line> to comfort or console: <line>and what should human pity do <line> <line> pent up in murderer's hole? <line>what word of grace in such a place <line> <line> could help a brother's soul? <line>with slouch and swing around the ring <line> <line> we trod the fools' parade! <line>we did not care: we knew we were <line> <line> the devil's own brigade: <line>and shaven head and feet of lead <line> <line> make a merry masquerade. <line>we tore the tarry rope to shreds <line> <line> with blunt and bleeding nails; <line>we rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors, <line> <line> and cleaned the shining rails: <line>and, rank by rank, we soaped the plank, <line> <line> and clattered with the pails. <line>we sewed the sacks, we broke the stones, <line> <line> we turned the dusty drill: <line>we banged the tins, and bawled the hymns, <line> <line> and sweated on the mill: <line>but in the heart of every man <line> <line> terror was lying still. <line>so still it lay that every day <line> <line> crawled like a weed-clogged wave: <line>and we forgot the bitter lot <line> <line> that waits for fool and knave, <line>till once, as we tramped in from work, <line> <line> we passed an open grave. <line>with yawning mouth the yellow hole <line> <line> gaped for a living thing; <line>the very mud cried out for blood <line> <line> to the thirsty asphalte ring: <line>and we knew that ere one dawn grew fair <line> <line> some prisoner had to swing. <line>right in we went, with soul intent <line> <line> on death and dread and doom: <line>the hangman, with his little bag, <line> <line> went shuffling through the gloom: <line>and each man trembled as he crept <line> <line> into his numbered tomb. <line>that night the empty corridors <line> <line> were full of forms of fear, <line>and up and down the iron town <line> <line> stole feet we could not hear, <line>and through the bars that hide the stars <line> <line> white faces seemed to peer. <line>he lay as one who lies and dreams <line> <line> in a pleasant meadow-land, <line>the watchers watched him as he slept, <line> <line> and could not understand <line>how one could sleep so sweet a sleep <line> <line> with a hangman close at hand. <line>but there is no sleep when men must weep <line> <line> who never yet have wept: <line>so we—the fool, the fraud, the knave— <line> <line> that endless vigil kept, <line>and through each brain on hands of pain <line> <line> another's terror crept. <line>alas! it is a fearful thing <line> <line> to feel another's guilt! <line>for, right within, the sword of sin <line> <line> pierced to its poisoned hilt, <line>and as molten lead were the tears we shed <line> <line> for the blood we had not spilt. <line>the warders with their shoes of felt <line> <line> crept by each padlocked door, <line>and peeped and saw, with eyes of awe, <line> <line> gray figures on the floor, <line>and wondered why men knelt to pray <line> <line> who never prayed before. <line>all through the night we knelt and prayed, <line> <line> mad mourners of a corse! <line>the troubled plumes of midnight were <line> <line> the plumes upon a hearse: <line>and bitter wine upon a sponge <line> <line> was the savour of remorse. <line>the gray cock crew, the red cock crew, <line> <line> but never came the day: <line>and crooked shapes of terror crouched, <line> <line> in the corners where we lay: <line>and each evil sprite that walks by night <line> <line> before us seemed to play. <line>they glided past, they glided fast, <line> <line> like travellers through a mist: <line>they mocked the moon in a rigadoon <line> <line> of delicate turn and twist, <line>and with formal pace and loathsome grace <line> <line> the phantoms kept their tryst. <line>with mop and mow, we saw them go, <line> <line> slim shadows hand in hand: <line>about, about, in ghostly rout <line> <line> they trod a saraband: <line>and damned grotesques made arabesques, <line> <line> like the wind upon the sand! <line>with the pirouettes of marionettes, <line> <line> they tripped on pointed tread: <line>but with flutes of fear they filled the ear, <line> <line> as their grisly masque they led, <line>and loud they sang, and long they sang, <line> <line> for they sang to wake the dead. <line>""oho!"" they cried, ""the world is wide, but fettered limbs go lame! and once, or twice, to throw the dice is a gentlemanly game, but he does not win who plays with sin in the secret house of shame."" no things of air these antics were, <line> <line> that frolicked with such glee: <line>to men whose lives were held in gyves, <line> <line> and whose feet might not go free, <line>ah! wounds of christ! they were living things, <line> <line> most terrible to see. <line>around, around, they waltzed and wound; <line> <line> some wheeled in smirking pairs; <line>with the mincing step of a demirep <line> <line> some sidled up the stairs: <line>and with subtle sneer, and fawning leer, <line> <line> each helped us at our prayers. <line>the morning wind began to moan, <line> <line> but still the night went on: <line>through its giant loom the web of gloom <line> <line> crept till each thread was spun: <line>and, as we prayed, we grew afraid <line> <line> of the justice of the sun. <line>the moaning wind went wandering round <line> <line> the weeping prison-wall: <line>till like a wheel of turning steel <line> <line> we felt the minutes crawl: <line>o moaning wind! what had we done <line> <line> to have such a seneschal? <line>at last i saw the shadowed bars, <line> <line> like a lattice wrought in lead, <line>move right across the whitewashed wall <line> <line> that faced my three-plank bed, <line>and i knew that somewhere in the world <line> <line> god's dreadful dawn was red. <line>at six o'clock we cleaned our cells, <line> <line> at seven all was still, <line>but the sough and swing of a mighty wing <line> <line> the prison seemed to fill, <line>for the lord of death with icy breath <line> <line> had entered in to kill. <line>he did not pass in purple pomp, <line> <line> nor ride a moon-white steed. <line>three yards of cord and a sliding board <line> <line> are all the gallows' need: <line>so with rope of shame the herald came <line> <line> to do the secret deed. <line>we were as men who through a fen <line> <line> of filthy darkness grope: <line>we did not dare to breathe a prayer, <line> <line> or to give our anguish scope: <line>something was dead in each of us, <line> <line> and what was dead was hope. <line>for man's grim justice goes its way <line> <line> and will not swerve aside: <line>it slays the weak, it slays the strong, <line> <line> it has a deadly stride: <line>with iron heel it slays the strong, <line> <line> the monstrous parricide! <line>we waited for the stroke of eight: <line> <line> each tongue was thick with thirst: <line>for the stroke of eight is the stroke of fate <line> <line> that makes a man accursed, <line>and fate will use a running noose <line> <line> for the best man and the worst. <line>we had no other thing to do, <line> <line> save to wait for the sign to come: <line>so, like things of stone in a valley lone, <line> <line> quiet we sat and dumb: <line>but each man's heart beat thick and quick, <line> <line> like a madman on a drum! <line>with sudden shock the prison-clock <line> <line> smote on the shivering air, <line>and from all the gaol rose up a wail <line> <line> of impotent despair, <line>like the sound the frightened marshes hear <line> <line> from some leper in his lair. <line>and as one sees most fearful things <line> <line> in the crystal of a dream, <line>we saw the greasy hempen rope <line> <line> hooked to the blackened beam, <line>and heard the prayer the hangman's snare <line> <line> strangled into a scream. <line>and all the woe that moved him so <line> <line> that he gave that bitter cry, <line>and the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats, <line> <line> none knew so well as i: <line>for he who lives more lives than one <line> <line> more deaths than one must die. <line>iv there is no chapel on the day <line> <line> on which they hang a man: <line>the chaplain's heart is far too sick, <line> <line> or his face is far too wan, <line>or there is that written in his eyes <line> <line> which none should look upon. <line>so they kept us close till nigh on noon, <line> <line> and then they rang the bell, <line>and the warders with their jingling keys <line> <line> opened each listening cell, <line>and down the iron stair we tramped, <line> <line> each from his separate hell. <line>out into god's sweet air we went, <line> <line> but not in wonted way, <line>for this man's face was white with fear, <line> <line> and that man's face was gray, <line>and i never saw sad men who looked <line> <line> so wistfully at the day. <line>i never saw sad men who looked <line> <line> with such a wistful eye <line>upon that little tent of blue <line> <line> we prisoners called the sky, <line>and at every careless cloud that passed <line> <line> in happy freedom by. <line>but there were those amongst us all <line> <line> who walked with downcast head, <line>and knew that, had each got his due, <line> <line> they should have died instead: <line>he had but killed a thing that lived, <line> <line> whilst they had killed the dead. <line>for he who sins a second time <line> <line> wakes a dead soul to pain, <line>and draws it from its spotted shroud, <line> <line> and makes it bleed again, <line>and makes it bleed great gouts of blood, <line> <line> and makes it bleed in vain! <line>like ape or clown, in monstrous garb <line> <line> with crooked arrows starred, <line>silently we went round and round <line> <line> the slippery asphalte yard; <line>silently we went round and round, <line> <line> and no man spoke a word. <line>silently we went round and round, <line> <line> and through each hollow mind <line>the memory of dreadful things <line> <line> rushed like a dreadful wind, <line>and horror stalked before each man, <line> <line> and terror crept behind. <line>the warders strutted up and down, <line> <line> and kept their herd of brutes, <line>their uniforms were spick and span, <line> <line> and they wore their sunday suits, <line>but we knew the work they had been at, <line> <line> by the quicklime on their boots. <line>for where a grave had opened wide, <line> <line> there was no grave at all: <line>only a stretch of mud and sand <line> <line> by the hideous prison-wall, <line>and a little heap of burning lime, <line> <line> that the man should have his pall. <line>for he has a pall, this wretched man, <line> <line> such as few men can claim: <line>deep down below a prison-yard, <line> <line> naked for greater shame, <line>he lies, with fetters on each foot, <line> <line> wrapt in a sheet of flame! <line>and all the while the burning lime <line> <line> eats flesh and bone away, <line>it eats the brittle bone by night, <line> <line> and the soft flesh by day, <line>it eats the flesh and bone by turns, <line> <line> but it eats the heart alway. <line>for three long years they will not sow <line> <line> or root or seedling there: <line>for three long years the unblessed spot <line> <line> will sterile be and bare, <line>and look upon the wondering sky <line> <line> with unreproachful stare. <line>they think a murderer's heart would taint <line> <line> each simple seed they sow. <line>it is not true! god's kindly earth <line> <line> is kindlier than men know, <line>and the red rose would but glow more red, <line> <line> the white rose whiter blow. <line>out of his mouth a red, red rose! <line> <line> out of his heart a white! <line>for who can say by what strange way, <line> <line> christ brings his will to light, <line>since the barren staff the pilgrim bore <line> <line> bloomed in the great pope's sight? <line>but neither milk-white rose nor red <line> <line> may bloom in prison air; <line>the shard, the pebble, and the flint, <line> <line> are what they give us there: <line>for flowers have been known to heal <line> <line> a common man's despair. <line>so never will wine-red rose or white, <line> <line> petal by petal, fall <line>on that stretch of mud and sand that lies <line> <line> by the hideous prison-wall, <line>to tell the men who tramp the yard <line> <line> that god's son died for all. <line>yet though the hideous prison-wall <line> <line> still hems him round and round, <line>and a spirit may not walk by night <line> <line> that is with fetters bound, <line>and a spirit may but weep that lies <line> <line> in such unholy ground, <line>he is at peace—this wretched man— <line> <line> at peace, or will be soon: <line>there is no thing to make him mad, <line> <line> nor does terror walk at noon, <line>for the lampless earth in which he lies <line> <line> has neither sun nor moon. <line>they hanged him as a beast is hanged: <line> <line> they did not even toll <line>a requiem that might have brought <line> <line> rest to his startled soul, <line>but hurriedly they took him out, <line> <line> and hid him in a hole. <line>they stripped him of his canvas clothes, <line> <line> and gave him to the flies: <line>they mocked the swollen purple throat, <line> <line> and the stark and staring eyes: <line>and with laughter loud they heaped the shroud <line> <line> in which their convict lies. <line>the chaplain would not kneel to pray <line> <line> by his dishonoured grave: <line>nor mark it with that blessed cross <line> <line> that christ for sinners gave, <line>because the man was one of those <line> <line> whom christ came down to save. <line>yet all is well; he has but passed <line> <line> to life's appointed bourne: <line>and alien tears will fill for him <line> <line> pity's long-broken urn, <line>for his mourners will be outcast men, <line> <line> and outcasts always mourn. <line>v i know not whether laws be right, <line> <line> or whether laws be wrong; <line>all that we know who lie in gaol <line> <line> is that the wall is strong; <line>and that each day is like a year, <line> <line> a year whose days are long. <line>but this i know, that every law <line> <line> that men have made for man, <line>since first man took his brother's life, <line> <line> and the sad world began, <line>but straws the wheat and saves the chaff <line> <line> with a most evil fan. <line>this too i know—and wise it were <line> <line> if each could know the same— <line>that every prison that men build <line> <line> is built with bricks of shame, <line>and bound with bars lest christ should see <line> <line> how men their brothers maim. <line>with bars they blur the gracious moon, <line> <line> and blind the goodly sun: <line>and they do well to hide their hell, <line> <line> for in it things are done <line>that son of god nor son of man <line> <line> ever should look upon! <line>the vilest deeds like poison weeds <line> <line> bloom well in prison-air: <line>it is only what is good in man <line> <line> that wastes and withers there: <line>pale anguish keeps the heavy gate, <line> <line> and the warder is despair. <line>for they starve the little frightened child <line> <line> till it weeps both night and day: <line>and they scourge the weak, and flog the fool, <line> <line> and gibe the old and gray, <line>and some grow mad, and all grow bad, <line> <line> and none a word may say. <line>each narrow cell in which we dwell <line> <line> is a foul and dark latrine, <line>and the fetid breath of living death <line> <line> chokes up each grated screen, <line>and all, but lust, is turned to dust <line> <line> in humanity's machine. <line>the brackish water that we drink <line> <line> creeps with a loathsome slime, <line>and the bitter bread they weigh in scales <line> <line> is full of chalk and lime, <line>and sleep will not lie down, but walks <line> <line> wild-eyed, and cries to time. <line>but though lean hunger and green thirst <line> <line> like asp with adder fight, <line>we have little care of prison fare, <line> <line> for what chills and kills outright <line>is that every stone one lifts by day <line> <line> becomes one's heart by night. <line>with midnight always in one's heart, <line> <line> and twilight in one's cell, <line>we turn the crank, or tear the rope, <line> <line> each in his separate hell, <line>and the silence is more awful far <line> <line> than the sound of a brazen bell. <line>and never a human voice comes near <line> <line> to speak a gentle word: <line>and the eye that watches through the door <line> <line> is pitiless and hard: <line>and by all forgot, we rot and rot, <line> <line> with soul and body marred. <line>and thus we rust life's iron chain <line> <line> degraded and alone: <line>and some men curse, and some men weep, <line> <line> and some men make no moan: <line>but god's eternal laws are kind <line> <line> and break the heart of stone. <line>and every human heart that breaks, <line> <line> in prison-cell or yard, <line>is as that broken box that gave <line> <line> its treasure to the lord, <line>and filled the unclean leper's house <line> <line> with the scent of costliest nard. <line>ah!

12777,5842,"<line> <line>who was the woman who lived in the kingdom behind the barrier.there are those who will tell you she was the wife of every man in the village.and one night while her husbands were finishing their day at the gasworks,the woman was boiling oats for her only child,a young girl who’d amassed a beautiful collection of spoons in her life,each one given to her by one of her mother’s husbands.and this same night the young daughter died.and the woman buried the daughter with her spoons in her pockets.come daybreak the hostiles appeared at the barrier with ice in their beards.“to hell with pax americana,” they said.and they camped outside the wall that night chanting war cries.you say you want to know the names of the war cries that survived history.“wheel the gun carriages up to the barrier of the empire of husbands.”“our first word is ruin and our next word is value.”there are those who will tell you the hostiles carried on like this for some weeks.until one night the dead daughter led them behind the barrier,through a tunnel she’d dug in the earth with her spoons.it was thus the hostiles made it their business to burn everything.they burned the village crops and the distillery.they burned the apothecary, the potash mine.black soot fell on the livery and they burned the livery too.and there’s another war cry that’s since survived history:“tonight like god’s scalp in your kingdom behind the barrierour burning makes snow and ends nowhere.”you say, where were the village husbands while all of this was happening.there are those who will tell you they were working their jobs at the gasworks,and when they heard the bullhorn roar in the watchtowerthey were smoking cigarillos and pacing the floor of the gasworks. and the roar of the bullhorn had a strange effect on the husbands,who each began daydreaming of his wife at home in the village.the first husband thought: “the taste of the breath of my wife,it’s like saying the word houndstooth to myself in the dark.”the next husband thought of her letting her hair down in front of a vanity,and smearing her blue eye shadow onto her fingers,and plucking the stray hairs and flyaways off her head.the next husband thought of her saying, “i’m correcting god’s blunders,”when he asked her why she wears all this foundation on her face. another husband thought: “quitting time is worthless to meso long as the work i do in the gasworks makes me think of my wife’s jawbone.”and all together the husbands said: “the jawbones of my wife,they beat both the same, like when i watch a train leave the kingdom,and all i can see is the pistons beating away in the smoke.”and when the hostiles entered the gasworks the husbands were dancing.and you say you want to know the words the hostiles spoke when they entered.there are those who will tell you they said this: “don’t quit dancing.”“there’s a penalty for an empire that believes it can survive itself,” they said.and so they pointed their war clubs at the husbands,and they said don’t quit, don’t quit dancing on the floor of the gasworks,and they bludgeoned to death the husbands who refused to keep dancing,and one by one the husbands fell dead on the floor of the gasworks,each one dancing himself to death at the hands of the hostiles.and this dancing took many deaths.but you say where was the wife who lost all her husbands this day.there are those who will tell you she was hiding the last of the cheese in a boot.she was rolling up the deed to her house in the village.she was picking up her daughter’s violin and stuffing the scroll in the violin’s f-hole.she was fleeing for the wall when she was stopped by the hostiles.dance, said the hostiles, and they pointed their war clubs at her skull.and these war clubs had a strange effect on the wife,who began daydreaming about a man who wasn’t her husband.she thought of cutting his hair in a sunflower patch in the village.the time should be dusk, she thought, and the shears,they should flash once in her hands like a scythe.she thought there should be two swarms of no-see-ums,one smoldering around each of her hands.and she’d tilt back the head of the man who wasn’t her husband.and she’d oil his throat with the badger brush in her hand.and he’d smell the sandalwood lather she worked in the bristles.and he’d smell the eau de cologne on her neck when she leaned in close.and she’d shave his throat with the blade of a balisong.and the woman thought each time he moaned when she stroked hima dragonfly should dance from his mouth.and he’ll moan until the dragonfly quits dancing, she thought.and i’ll dance around his throat all night like a lantern.“because a war club doesn’t taste like a war club,” she said.“it tastes like my husbands all breathing at once.”she spoke these words with a hole in her skull in the snow.and the smoke coming out of the hole was her thoughts.and her body lying there in the village square was so beautifulthe hostiles began to dance on either side of the body.and they danced, and they danced, until they too fell dead in the snow beside her. <line>","living,death,the body,relationships,home life,men & women,social commentaries,war

then forgive this boast, belovèd brethren, and withdraw no portion of your wonted favour now! mother of this unfathomable world! favour my solemn song, for i have loved thee ever, and thee only; i have watched thy shadow, and the darkness of thy steps, and my heart ever gazes on the depth of thy deep mysteries. i have made my bed in charnels and on coffins, where black death keeps record of the trophies won from thee, hoping to still these obstinate questionings of thee and thine, by forcing some lone ghost thy messenger, to render up the tale of what we are. in lone and silent hours, when night makes a weird sound of its own stillness, like an inspired and desperate alchymist staking his very life on some dark hope, have i mixed awful talk and asking looks with my most innocent love, until strange tears uniting with those breathless kisses, made such magic as compels the charmèd night to render up thy charge:...and, though ne'er yet thou hast unveiled thy inmost sanctuary, enough from incommunicable dream, and twilight phantasms, and deep noon-day thought, has shone within me, that serenely now and moveless, as a long-forgotten lyre suspended in the solitary dome of some mysterious and deserted fane, i wait thy breath, great parent, that my strain may modulate with murmurs of the air, and motions of the forests and the sea, and voice of living beings, and woven hymns of night and day, and the deep heart of man. there was a poet whose untimely tomb no human hands with pious reverence reared, but the charmed eddies of autumnal winds built o'er his mouldering bones a pyramid of mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness:— a lovely youth,—no mourning maiden decked with weeping flowers, or votive cypress wreath, the lone couch of his everlasting sleep:— gentle, and brave, and generous,—no lorn bard breathed o'er his dark fate one melodious sigh: he lived, he died, he sung, in solitude. strangers have wept to hear his passionate notes, and virgins, as unknown he passed, have pined and wasted for fond love of his wild eyes. the fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn, and silence, too enamoured of that voice, locks its mute music in her rugged cell. by solemn vision, and bright silver dream, his infancy was nurtured. every sight and sound from the vast earth and ambient air, sent to his heart its choicest impulses. the fountains of divine philosophy fled not his thirsting lips, and all of great, or good, or lovely, which the sacred past in truth or fable consecrates, he felt and knew. when early youth had past, he left his cold fireside and alienated home to seek strange truths in undiscovered lands. many a wide waste and tangled wilderness has lured his fearless steps; and he has bought with his sweet voice and eyes, from savage men, his rest and food. nature's most secret steps he like her shadow has pursued, where'er the red volcano overcanopies its fields of snow and pinnacles of ice with burning smoke, or where bitumen lakes on black bare pointed islets ever beat with sluggish surge, or where the secret caves rugged and dark, winding among the springs of fire and poison, inaccessible to avarice or pride, their starry domes of diamond and of gold expand above numberless and immeasurable halls, frequent with crystal column, and clear shrines of pearl, and thrones radiant with chrysolite. nor had that scene of ampler majesty than gems or gold, the varying roof of heaven and the green earth lost in his heart its claims to love and wonder; he would linger long in lonesome vales, making the wild his home, until the doves and squirrels would partake from his innocuous hand his bloodless food, lured by the gentle meaning of his looks, and the wild antelope, that starts whene'er the dry leaf rustles in the brake, suspend her timid steps to gaze upon a form more graceful than her own. his wandering step obedient to high thoughts, has visited the awful ruins of the days of old: athens, and tyre, and balbec, and the waste where stood jerusalem, the fallen towers of babylon, the eternal pyramids, memphis and thebes, and whatsoe'er of strange sculptured on alabaster obelisk, or jasper tomb, or mutilated sphynx, dark æthiopia in her desert hills conceals. among the ruined temples there, stupendous columns, and wild images of more than man, where marble daemons watch the zodiac's brazen mystery, and dead men hang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around, he lingered, poring on memorials of the world's youth, through the long burning day gazed on those speechless shapes, nor, when the moon filled the mysterious halls with floating shades suspended he that task, but ever gazed and gazed, till meaning on his vacant mind flashed like strong inspiration, and he saw the thrilling secrets of the birth of time. meanwhile an arab maiden brought his food, her daily portion, from her father's tent, and spread her matting for his couch, and stole from duties and repose to tend his steps:— enamoured, yet not daring for deep awe to speak her love:—and watched his nightly sleep, sleepless herself, to gaze upon his lips parted in slumber, whence the regular breath of innocent dreams arose: then, when red morn made paler the pale moon, to her cold home wildered, and wan, and panting, she returned. the poet wandering on, through arabie and persia, and the wild carmanian waste, and o'er the aërial mountains which pour down indus and oxus from their icy caves, in joy and exultation held his way; till in the vale of cashmire, far within its loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower, beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched his languid limbs. a vision on his sleep there came, a dream of hopes that never yet had flushed his cheek. he dreamed a veilèd maid sate near him, talking in low solemn tones. her voice was like the voice of his own soul heard in the calm of thought; its music long, like woven sounds of streams and breezes, held his inmost sense suspended in its web of many-coloured woof and shifting hues. knowledge and truth and virtue were her theme, and lofty hopes of divine liberty, thoughts the most dear to him, and poesy, herself a poet. soon the solemn mood of her pure mind kindled through all her frame a permeating fire: wild numbers then she raised, with voice stifled in tremulous sobs subdued by its own pathos: her fair hands were bare alone, sweeping from some strange harp strange symphony, and in their branching veins the eloquent blood told an ineffable tale. the beating of her heart was heard to fill the pauses of her music, and her breath tumultuously accorded with those fits of intermitted song. sudden she rose, as if her heart impatiently endured its bursting burthen: at the sound he turned, and saw by the warm light of their own life her glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil of woven wind, her outspread arms now bare, her dark locks floating in the breath of night, her beamy bending eyes, her parted lips outstretched, and pale, and quivering eagerly. his strong heart sunk and sickened with excess of love. he reared his shuddering limbs and quelled his gasping breath, and spread his arms to meet her panting bosom:...she drew back a while, then, yielding to the irresistible joy, with frantic gesture and short breathless cry folded his frame in her dissolving arms. now blackness veiled his dizzy eyes, and night involved and swallowed up the vision; sleep, like a dark flood suspended in its course rolled back its impulse on his vacant brain. roused by the shock he started from his trance— the cold white light of morning, the blue moon low in the west, the clear and garish hills, the distinct valley and the vacant woods, spread round him where he stood. whither have fled the hues of heaven that canopied his bower of yesternight? the sounds that soothed his sleep, the mystery and the majesty of earth, the joy, the exultation? his wan eyes gaze on the empty scene as vacantly as ocean's moon looks on the moon in heaven. the spirit of sweet human love has sent a vision to the sleep of him who spurned her choicest gifts. he eagerly pursues beyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade; he overleaps the bounds. alas! alas! were limbs and breath and being intertwined thus treacherously? lost, lost, for ever lost, in the wide pathless desert of dim sleep, that beautiful shape! does the dark gate of death conduct to thy mysterious paradise, o sleep? does the bright arch of rainbow clouds, and pendent mountains seen in the calm lake, lead only to a black and watery depth, while death's blue vault, with loathliest vapours hung, where every shade which the foul grave exhales hides its dead eye from the detested day, conduct, o sleep, to thy delightful realms? this doubt with sudden tide flowed on his heart, the insatiate hope which it awakened stung his brain even like despair. while daylight held the sky, the poet kept mute conference with his still soul. at night the passion came, like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream, and shook him from his rest, and led him forth into the darkness.—as an eagle grasped in folds of the green serpent, feels her breast burn with the poison, and precipitates through night and day, tempest, and calm, and cloud, frantic with dizzying anguish, her blind flight o'er the wide aëry wilderness: thus driven by the bright shadow of that lovely dream, beneath the cold glare of the desolate night, through tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells, startling with careless step the moonlight snake, he fled. red morning dawned upon his flight, shedding the mockery of its vital hues upon his cheek of death. he wandered on till vast aornos, seen from petra's steep, hung o'er the low horizon like a cloud; through balk, and where the desolated tombs of parthian kings scatter to every wind their wasting dust, wildly he wandered on, day after day a weary waste of hours, bearing within his life the brooding care that ever fed on its decaying flame. and now his limbs were lean; his scattered hair sered by the autumn of strange suffering sung dirges in the wind; his listless hand hung like dead bone within its withered skin; life, and the lustre that consumed it, shone as in a furnace burning secretly from his dark eyes alone. the cottagers, who ministered with human charity his human wants, beheld with wondering awe their fleeting visitant. the mountaineer, encountering on some dizzy precipice that spectral form, deemed that the spirit of wind with lightning eyes, and eager breath, and feet disturbing not the drifted snow, had paused in its career: the infant would conceal his troubled visage in his mother's robe in terror at the glare of those wild eyes, to remember their strange light in many a dream of after-times; but youthful maidens, taught by nature, would interpret half the woe that wasted him, would call him with false names brother, and friend, would press his pallid hand at parting, and watch, dim through tears, the path of his departure from their father's door. at length upon the lone chorasmian shore he paused, a wide and melancholy waste of putrid marshes. a strong impulse urged his steps to the sea-shore. a swan was there, beside a sluggish stream among the reeds. it rose as he approached, and with strong wings scaling the upward sky, bent its bright course high over the immeasurable main. his eyes pursued its flight.—""thou hast a home, beautiful bird; thou voyagest to thine home, where thy sweet mate will twine her downy neck with thine, and welcome thy return with eyes bright in the lustre of their own fond joy. and what am i that i should linger here, with voice far sweeter than thy dying notes, spirit more vast than thine, frame more attuned to beauty, wasting these surpassing powers in the deaf air, to the blind earth, and heaven that echoes not my thoughts?"" a gloomy smile of desperate hope wrinkled his quivering lips. for sleep, he knew, kept most relentlessly its precious charge, and silent death exposed, faithless perhaps as sleep, a shadowy lure, with doubtful smile mocking its own strange charms. startled by his own thoughts he looked around. there was no fair fiend near him, not a sight or sound of awe but in his own deep mind. a little shallop floating near the shore caught the impatient wandering of his gaze. it had been long abandoned, for its sides gaped wide with many a rift, and its frail joints swayed with the undulations of the tide. a restless impulse urged him to embark and meet lone death on the drear ocean's waste; for well he knew that mighty shadow loves the slimy caverns of the populous deep. the day was fair and sunny: sea and sky drank its inspiring radiance, and the wind swept strongly from the shore, blackening the waves. following his eager soul, the wanderer leaped in the boat, he spread his cloak aloft on the bare mast, and took his lonely seat, and felt the boat speed o'er the tranquil sea like a torn cloud before the hurricane. as one that in a silver vision floats obedient to the sweep of odorous winds upon resplendent clouds, so rapidly along the dark and ruffled waters fled the straining boat.—a whirlwind swept it on, with fierce gusts and precipitating force, through the white ridges of the chafèd sea. the waves arose. higher and higher still their fierce necks writhed beneath the tempest's scourge like serpents struggling in a vulture's grasp. calm and rejoicing in the fearful war of wave ruining on wave, and blast on blast descending, and black flood on whirlpool driven with dark obliterating course, he sate: as if their genii were the ministers appointed to conduct him to the light of those belovèd eyes, the poet sate holding the steady helm. evening came on, the beams of sunset hung their rainbow hues high 'mid the shifting domes of sheeted spray that canopied his path o'er the waste deep; twilight, ascending slowly from the east, entwined in duskier wreaths her braided locks o'er the fair front and radiant eyes of day; night followed, clad with stars. on every side more horribly the multitudinous streams of ocean's mountainous waste to mutual war rushed in dark tumult thundering, as to mock the calm and spangled sky. the little boat still fled before the storm; still fled, like foam down the steep cataract of a wintry river; now pausing on the edge of the riven wave; now leaving far behind the bursting mass that fell, convulsing ocean. safely fled— as if that frail and wasted human form, had been an elemental god. at midnight the moon arose: and lo! the ethereal cliffs of caucasus, whose icy summits shone among the stars like sunlight, and around whose caverned base the whirlpools and the waves bursting and eddying irresistibly rage and resound for ever.—who shall save?— the boat fled on,—the boiling torrent drove,— the crags closed round with black and jaggèd arms, the shattered mountain overhung the sea, and faster still, beyond all human speed, suspended on the sweep of the smooth wave, the little boat was driven. a cavern there yawned, and amid its slant and winding depths ingulfed the rushing sea. the boat fled on with unrelaxing speed.—""vision and love!"" the poet cried aloud, ""i have beheld the path of thy departure. sleep and death shall not divide us long!"" the boat pursued the windings of the cavern. daylight shone at length upon that gloomy river's flow; now, where the fiercest war among the waves is calm, on the unfathomable stream the boat moved slowly. where the mountain, riven, exposed those black depths to the azure sky, ere yet the flood's enormous volume fell even to the base of caucasus, with sound that shook the everlasting rocks, the mass filled with one whirlpool all that ample chasm; stair above stair the eddying waters rose, circling immeasurably fast, and laved with alternating dash the gnarlèd roots of mighty trees, that stretched their giant arms in darkness over it. i' the midst was left, reflecting, yet distorting every cloud, a pool of treacherous and tremendous calm. seized by the sway of the ascending stream, with dizzy swiftness, round, and round, and round, ridge after ridge the straining boat arose, till on the verge of the extremest curve, where, through an opening of the rocky bank, the waters overflow, and a smooth spot of glassy quiet mid those battling tides is left, the boat paused shuddering.—shall it sink down the abyss? shall the reverting stress of that resistless gulf embosom it? now shall it fall?—a wandering stream of wind, breathed from the west, has caught the expanded sail, and, lo! with gentle motion, between banks of mossy slope, and on a placid stream, beneath a woven grove it sails, and, hark! the ghastly torrent mingles its far roar, with the breeze murmuring in the musical woods. where the embowering trees recede, and leave a little space of green expanse, the cove is closed by meeting banks, whose yellow flowers for ever gaze on their own drooping eyes, reflected in the crystal calm. the wave of the boat's motion marred their pensive task, which nought but vagrant bird, or wanton wind, or falling spear-grass, or their own decay had e'er disturbed before. the poet longed to deck with their bright hues his withered hair, but on his heart its solitude returned, and he forbore. not the strong impulse hid in those flushed cheeks, bent eyes, and shadowy frame had yet performed its ministry: it hung upon his life, as lightning in a cloud gleams, hovering ere it vanish, ere the floods of night close over it. the noonday sun now shone upon the forest, one vast mass of mingling shade, whose brown magnificence a narrow vale embosoms. there, huge caves scooped in the dark base of their aëry rocks mocking its moans, respond and roar for ever. the meeting boughs and implicated leaves wove twilight o'er the poet's path, as led by love, or dream, or god, or mightier death, he sought in nature's dearest haunt, some bank her cradle, and his sepulchre. more dark and dark the shades accumulate. the oak, expanding its immense and knotty arms, embraces the light beech. the pyramids of the tall cedar overarching, frame most solemn domes within, and far below, like clouds suspended in an emerald sky, the ash and the acacia floating hang tremulous and pale. like restless serpents, clothed in rainbow and in fire, the parasites, starred with ten thousand blossoms, flow around the grey trunks, and, as gamesome infants' eyes, with gentle meanings, and most innocent wiles, fold their beams round the hearts of those that love, these twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs uniting their close union; the woven leaves make net-work of the dark blue light of day, and the night's noontide clearness, mutable as shapes in the weird clouds. soft mossy lawns beneath these canopies extend their swells, fragrant with perfumed herbs, and eyed with blooms minute yet beautiful. one darkest glen sends from its woods of musk-rose, twined with jasmine, a soul-dissolving odour, to invite to some more lovely mystery. through the dell, silence and twilight here, twin-sisters, keep their noonday watch, and sail among the shades, like vaporous shapes half seen; beyond, a well, dark, gleaming, and of most translucent wave, images all the woven boughs above, and each depending leaf, and every speck of azure sky, darting between their chasms; nor aught else in the liquid mirror laves its portraiture, but some inconstant star between one foliaged lattice twinkling fair, or painted bird, sleeping beneath the moon, or gorgeous insect floating motionless, unconscious of the day, ere yet his wings have spread their glories to the gaze of noon. hither the poet came. his eyes beheld their own wan light through the reflected lines of his thin hair, distinct in the dark depth of that still fountain; as the human heart, gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave, sees its own treacherous likeness there. he heard the motion of the leaves, the grass that sprung startled and glanced and trembled even to feel an unaccustomed presence, and the sound of the sweet brook that from the secret springs of that dark fountain rose. a spirit seemed to stand beside him—clothed in no bright robes of shadowy silver or enshrining light, borrowed from aught the visible world affords of grace, or majesty, or mystery;— but, undulating woods, and silent well, and leaping rivulet, and evening gloom now deepening the dark shades, for speech assuming, held commune with him, as if he and it were all that was,—only... when his regard was raised by intense pensiveness,... two eyes, two starry eyes, hung in the gloom of thought, and seemed with their serene and azure smiles to beckon him. obedient to the light that shone within his soul, he went, pursuing the windings of the dell.—the rivulet wanton and wild, through many a green ravine beneath the forest flowed. sometimes it fell among the moss, with hollow harmony dark and profound. now on the polished stones it danced; like childhood laughing as it went: then, through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept, reflecting every herb and drooping bud that overhung its quietness.—""o stream! whose source is inaccessibly profound, whither do thy mysterious waters tend? thou imagest my life. thy darksome stillness, thy dazzling waves, thy loud and hollow gulfs, thy searchless fountain, and invisible course have each their type in me: and the wide sky, and measureless ocean may declare as soon what oozy cavern or what wandering cloud contains thy waters, as the universe tell where these living thoughts reside, when stretched upon thy flowers my bloodless limbs shall waste i' the passing wind!"" beside the grassy shore of the small stream he went; he did impress on the green moss his tremulous step, that caught strong shuddering from his burning limbs. as one roused by some joyous madness from the couch of fever, he did move; yet, not like him, forgetful of the grave, where, when the flame of his frail exultation shall be spent, he must descend. with rapid steps he went beneath the shade of trees, beside the flow of the wild babbling rivulet; and now the forest's solemn canopies were changed for the uniform and lightsome evening sky. grey rocks did peep from the spare moss, and stemmed the struggling brook: tall spires of windlestrae threw their thin shadows down the rugged slope, and nought but gnarlèd roots of ancient pines branchless and blasted, clenched with grasping roots the unwilling soil. a gradual change was here, yet ghastly. for, as fast years flow away, the smooth brow gathers, and the hair grows thin and white, and where irradiate dewy eyes had shone, gleam stony orbs:—so from his steps bright flowers departed, and the beautiful shade of the green groves, with all their odorous winds and musical motions. calm, he still pursued the stream, that with a larger volume now rolled through the labyrinthine dell; and there fretted a path through its descending curves with its wintry speed. on every side now rose rocks, which, in unimaginable forms, lifted their black and barren pinnacles in the light of evening, and its precipice obscuring the ravine, disclosed above, mid toppling stones, black gulfs and yawning caves, whose windings gave ten thousand various tongues to the loud stream. lo! where the pass expands its stony jaws, the abrupt mountain breaks, and seems, with its accumulated crags, to overhang the world: for wide expand beneath the wan stars and descending moon islanded seas, blue mountains, mighty streams, dim tracts and vast, robed in the lustrous gloom of leaden-coloured even, and fiery hills mingling their flames with twilight, on the verge of the remote horizon. the near scene, in naked and severe simplicity, made contrast with the universe. a pine, rock-rooted, stretched athwart the vacancy its swinging boughs, to each inconstant blast yielding one only response, at each pause, in most familiar cadence, with the howl the thunder and the hiss of homeless streams mingling its solemn song, whilst the broad river, foaming and hurrying o'er its rugged path, fell into that immeasurable void, scattering its waters to the passing winds. yet the grey precipice and solemn pine and torrent, were not all;—one silent nook was there. even on the edge of that vast mountain, upheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks, it overlooked in its serenity the dark earth, and the bending vault of stars. it was a tranquil spot, that seemed to smile even in the lap of horror. ivy clasped the fissured stones with its entwining arms, and did embower with leaves for ever green, and berries dark, the smooth and even space of its inviolated floor, and here the children of the autumnal whirlwind bore, in wanton sport, those bright leaves, whose decay, red, yellow, or ethereally pale, rivals the pride of summer. 'tis the haunt of every gentle wind, whose breath can teach the wilds to love tranquillity. one step, one human step alone, has ever broken the stillness of its solitude:—one voice alone inspired its echoes;—even that voice which hither came, floating among the winds, and led the loveliest among human forms to make their wild haunts the depository of all the grace and beauty that endued its motions, render up its majesty, scatter its music on the unfeeling storm, and to the damp leaves and blue cavern mould, nurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss, commit the colours of that varying cheek, that snowy breast, those dark and drooping eyes. the dim and hornèd moon hung low, and poured a sea of lustre on the horizon's verge that overflowed its mountains. yellow mist filled the unbounded atmosphere, and drank wan moonlight even to fulness: not a star shone, not a sound was heard; the very winds, danger's grim playmates, on that precipice slept, clasped in his embrace.—o, storm of death! whose sightless speed divides this sullen night: and thou, colossal skeleton, that, still guiding its irresistible career in thy devastating omnipotence, art king of this frail world, from the red field of slaughter, from the reeking hospital, the patriot's sacred couch, the snowy bed of innocence, the scaffold and the throne, a mighty voice invokes thee. ruin calls his brother death. a rare and regal prey he hath prepared, prowling around the world; glutted with which thou mayst repose, and men go to their graves like flowers or creeping worms, nor ever more offer at thy dark shrine the unheeded tribute of a broken heart. when on the threshold of the green recess the wanderer's footsteps fell, he knew that death was on him. yet a little, ere it fled, did he resign his high and holy soul to images of the majestic past, that paused within his passive being now, like winds that bear sweet music, when they breathe through some dim latticed chamber. he did place his pale lean hand upon the rugged trunk of the old pine. upon an ivied stone reclined his languid head, his limbs did rest, diffused and motionless, on the smooth brink of that obscurest chasm;—and thus he lay, surrendering to their final impulses the hovering powers of life. hope and despair, the torturers, slept; no mortal pain or fear marred his repose, the influxes of sense, and his own being unalloyed by pain, yet feebler and more feeble, calmly fed the stream of thought, till he lay breathing there at peace, and faintly smiling:—his last sight was the great moon, which o'er the western line of the wide world her mighty horn suspended, with whose dun beams inwoven darkness seemed to mingle. now upon the jaggèd hills it rests, and still as the divided frame of the vast meteor sunk, the poet's blood, that ever beat in mystic sympathy with nature's ebb and flow, grew feebler still: and when two lessening points of light alone gleamed through the darkness, the alternate gasp of his faint respiration scarce did stir the stagnate night:—till the minutest ray was quenched, the pulse yet lingered in his heart. it paused—it fluttered. but when heaven remained utterly black, the murky shades involved an image, silent, cold, and motionless, as their own voiceless earth and vacant air. even as a vapour fed with golden beams that ministered on sunlight, ere the west eclipses it, was now that wondrous frame— no sense, no motion, no divinity— a fragile lute, on whose harmonious strings the breath of heaven did wander—a bright stream once fed with many-voicèd waves—a dream of youth, which night and time have quenched for ever, still, dark, and dry, and unremembered now. o, for medea's wondrous alchemy, which wheresoe'er it fell made the earth gleam with bright flowers, and the wintry boughs exhale from vernal blooms fresh fragrance! o, that god, profuse of poisons, would concede the chalice which but one living man has drained, who now, vessel of deathless wrath, a slave that feels no proud exemption in the blighting curse he bears, over the world wanders for ever, lone as incarnate death! o, that the dream of dark magician in his visioned cave, raking the cinders of a crucible for life and power, even when his feeble hand shakes in its last decay, were the true law of this so lovely world! but thou art fled like some frail exhalation; which the dawn robes in its golden beams,—ah! thou hast fled! the brave, the gentle, and the beautiful, the child of grace and genius. heartless things are done and said i' the world, and many worms and beasts and men live on, and mighty earth from sea and mountain, city and wilderness, in vesper low or joyous orison, lifts still its solemn voice:—but thou art fled— thou canst no longer know or love the shapes of this phantasmal scene, who have to thee been purest ministers, who are, alas! now thou art not. upon those pallid lips so sweet even in their silence, on those eyes that image sleep in death, upon that form yet safe from the worm's outrage, let no tear be shed—not even in thought. nor, when those hues are gone, and those divinest lineaments, worn by the senseless wind, shall live alone in the frail pauses of this simple strain, let not high verse, mourning the memory of that which is no more, or painting's woe or sculpture, speak in feeble imagery their own cold powers. art and eloquence, and all the shows o' the world are frail and vain to weep a loss that turns their lights to shade. it is a woe too ""deep for tears,"" when all is reft at once, when some surpassing spirit, whose light adorned the world around it, leaves those who remain behind, not sobs or groans, the passionate tumult of a clinging hope; but pale despair and cold tranquillity, nature's vast frame, the web of human things, birth and the grave, that are not as they were. <line>","living,death,sorrow & grieving,the mind,activities,travels & journeys,nature,landscapes & pastorals,arts & sciences,poetry & poets"
