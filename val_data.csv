i am sick of singing; the bays burn deep and chafe: i am fain to rest a little from praise and grievous pleasure and pain. for the gods we know not of, who give us our daily breath, we know they are cruel as love or life, and lovely as death. o gods dethroned and deceased, cast forth, wiped out in a day! from your wrath is the world released, redeemed from your chains, men say. new gods are crowned in the city; their flowers have broken your rods; they are merciful, clothed with pity, the young compassionate gods. but for me their new device is barren, the days are bare; things long past over suffice, and men forgotten that were. time and the gods are at strife; ye dwell in the midst thereof, draining a little life from the barren breasts of love. i say to you, cease, take rest; yea, i say to you all, be at peace, till the bitter milk of her breast and the barren bosom shall cease. wilt thou yet take all, galilean? but these thou shalt not take, the laurel, the palms and the pæan, the breasts of the nymphs in the brake; breasts more soft than a dove's, that tremble with tenderer breath; and all the wings of the loves, and all the joy before death; all the feet of the hours that sound as a single lyre, dropped and deep in the flowers, with strings that flicker like fire. more than these wilt thou give, things fairer than all these things? nay, for a little we live, and life hath mutable wings. a little while and we die; shall life not thrive as it may? for no man under the sky lives twice, outliving his day. and grief is a grievous thing, and a man hath enough of his tears: why should he labour, and bring fresh grief to blacken his years? thou hast conquered, o pale galilean; the world has grown grey from thy breath; we have drunken of things lethean, and fed on the fullness of death. laurel is green for a season, and love is sweet for a day; but love grows bitter with treason, and laurel outlives not may. sleep, shall we sleep after all? for the world is not sweet in the end; for the old faiths loosen and fall, the new years ruin and rend. fate is a sea without shore, and the soul is a rock that abides; but her ears are vexed with the roar and her face with the foam of the tides. o lips that the live blood faints in, the leavings of racks and rods! o ghastly glories of saints, dead limbs of gibbeted gods! though all men abase them before you in spirit, and all knees bend, i kneel not neither adore you, but standing, look to the end. all delicate days and pleasant, all spirits and sorrows are cast far out with the foam of the present that sweeps to the surf of the past: where beyond the extreme sea-wall, and between the remote sea-gates, waste water washes, and tall ships founder, and deep death waits: where, mighty with deepening sides, clad about with the seas as with wings, and impelled of invisible tides, and fulfilled of unspeakable things, white-eyed and poisonous-finned, shark-toothed and serpentine-curled, rolls, under the whitening wind of the future, the wave of the world. the depths stand naked in sunder behind it, the storms flee away; in the hollow before it the thunder is taken and snared as a prey; in its sides is the north-wind bound; and its salt is of all men's tears; with light of ruin, and sound of changes, and pulse of years: with travail of day after day, and with trouble of hour upon hour; and bitter as blood is the spray; and the crests are as fangs that devour: and its vapour and storm of its steam as the sighing of spirits to be; and its noise as the noise in a dream; and its depth as the roots of the sea: and the height of its heads as the height of the utmost stars of the air: and the ends of the earth at the might thereof tremble, and time is made bare. will ye bridle the deep sea with reins, will ye chasten the high sea with rods? will ye take her to chain her with chains, who is older than all ye gods? all ye as a wind shall go by, as a fire shall ye pass and be past; ye are gods, and behold, ye shall die, and the waves be upon you at last. in the darkness of time, in the deeps of the years, in the changes of things, ye shall sleep as a slain man sleeps, and the world shall forget you for kings. though the feet of thine high priests tread where thy lords and our forefathers trod, though these that were gods are dead, and thou being dead art a god, though before thee the throned cytherean be fallen, and hidden her head, yet thy kingdom shall pass, galilean, thy dead shall go down to thee dead. of the maiden thy mother men sing as a goddess with grace clad around; thou art throned where another was king; where another was queen she is crowned. yea, once we had sight of another: but now she is queen, say these. not as thine, not as thine was our mother, a blossom of flowering seas, clothed round with the world's desire as with raiment, and fair as the foam, and fleeter than kindled fire, and a goddess, and mother of rome. for thine came pale and a maiden, and sister to sorrow; but ours, her deep hair heavily laden with odour and colour of flowers, white rose of the rose-white water, a silver splendour, a flame, bent down unto us that besought her, and earth grew sweet with her name. for thine came weeping, a slave among slaves, and rejected; but she came flushed from the full-flushed wave, and imperial, her foot on the sea. and the wonderful waters knew her, the winds and the viewless ways, and the roses grew rosier, and bluer the sea-blue stream of the bays. ye are fallen, our lords, by what token? we wise that ye should not fall. ye were all so fair that are broken; and one more fair than ye all. but i turn to her still, having seen she shall surely abide in the end; goddess and maiden and queen, be near me now and befriend. o daughter of earth, of my mother, her crown and blossom of birth, i am also, i also, thy brother; i go as i came unto earth. in the night where thine eyes are as moons are in heaven, the night where thou art, where the silence is more than all tunes, where sleep overflows from the heart, where the poppies are sweet as the rose in our world, and the red rose is white, and the wind falls faint as it blows with the fume of the flowers of the night, and the murmur of spirits that sleep in the shadow of gods from afar grows dim in thine ears and deep as the deep dim soul of a star, in the sweet low light of thy face, under heavens untrod by the sun, let my soul with their souls find place, and forget what is done and undone. thou art more than the gods who number the days of our temporal breath; let these give labour and slumber; but thou, proserpina, death. therefore now at thy feet i abide for a season in silence. i know i shall die as my fathers died, and sleep as they sleep; even so. for the glass of the years is brittle wherein we gaze for a span; a little soul for a little bears up this corpse which is man. so long i endure, no longer; and laugh not again, neither weep. for there is no god found stronger than death; and death is a sleep. <line>","religion,christianity,mythology & folklore,greek & roman mythology"

22just in the dawn of blushing womanhood; her swan-neck glimpsed through shocks of wavy hair;a hint of olives in her gentle blood, suggesting passion in a rosy lair;this shapely venus of the cabins stood, in all but birth a princess, tall and fair;and is it any wonder that this braveand proud young master came to love his slave? 28if it be shame to love a pretty woman, then shameful loving is a pretty thing.and of all things the most divinely human is this:—love purifies life’s fountain spring;and he who has not quaffed that fount is no man— i’d rather be a lover than a king.and then, preach as we will or may, we’ll findthat cupid, dear young god, is sometimes blind. 55before the world, i hold that none of these: the shushan slave, the oreb shepherdess,nor moab’s gleaner, ever had the ease of carriage, grace of speech, the statelinessof step and pose, nor had the art to please and charm with symphonies of form and dress,nor had such wond’rous eyes, such lovely mouth,as had this blue-eyed daughter [lena] of the south! 56had priest or prophet ever heard her singing, or seen her, where the clover was in bloom,wading knee-deep, while larks were upward springing, and winds could scarcely breathe for want of room—thus seen her from the dappled hillsides bringing the cows home, in the sunset’s golden gloom,our good old bible would have had much moreof love and romance mixed with sacred lore. 57what man is there who would not dare defend a life like this? is doing so a sin?or who should blush to be known as her friend? white wonder of creation, fashioned inthe moulds of loveliness; kings might contend on martial fields a prize like her to win,and yet, the cabin’s hate and mansion’s scorn,—she suffered both, betwixt them being born. 59when genial spring first hears the mating thrush, where waters gossip and the wild flowers throng,love rears her altar in the leafy bush, and nature chants the sweetest bridal-song.when love is free, with madness in its rush, its very strength defends the heart from wrong.love, when untutored, walks a harmless way,with feet, though bare, that never go astray. 153mind knows no death. life is the “first and last.” the falling leaf leaves its source living still;the flower which withers in the autumn blast dies not, but thus escapes the winter’s chill,and will return, through changes strange and vast, when summoned forth to range o’er vale and hill.shall mind which thus perceives life’s changes die?hath only matter immortality?

a machine-gunned <line> <line>death heap in the center of their village— <line> <line>“they killed all the men. but when my family <line> <line>came here, she came with her girl, we helped with the <line> <line>green card, and she’s a hotel maid now <line> <line>near the un ...” much realer, this, than our own <line> <line>bridge-inflicted, some-day disaster. and who knew <line> <line>but our bridge might metamorphose, <line> <line>as the city said (“global cities draw capital”), into a river <line> <line>of money (“we’ll all sell cuchifritos on the ramp”), <line> <line>and anyway, mainly, summeriii <line> <line>was running out, with its open evenings <line> <line>and windows. one saturday, turning onto my block <line> <line>from the subway, i heard my name, crossed <line> <line>the street where twin buildings had area-ways. <line> <line>and saw you waving, the same, pilar, <line> <line>from a window below the swag-bellied area railings. <line> <line>“come have some coffee—go around in back.” <line> <line>i walked down the building-side, and turned in a trash-littered <line> <line>airwell by a door with multiple doorbells. <line> <line>you opened from a wooden hallway, unpainted, <line> <line>with padlocked doors. “see, the super’s cut up his flat <line> <line>for illegals. they took out an inside wall, so our room <line> <line>has a window—we all share the bath.” i entered <line> <line>a lime-walled room—chairs and table, sofa-bed. your front wall <line> <line>was the building front, the three others <line> <line>drywall. on the bureau, a black-shawledprie-dieu: two photos; two candles in translucent, white-waxed sacks, <line> <line>and a polychrome madonna with meeting brows. <line> <line>through your window, car wheels, railings; and, above, <line> <line>my own second-story windows. “we saw you <line> <line>reading there,” you said from behind me, “when we moved in.” <line> <line>you sat me on the sofa, and formally presented your daughter <line> <line>(she moved her schoolbooks all to one end.) near her, a shallow, <line> <line>linoleumed-over trench and a bathroom sink. you said: <line> <line>“i’m a widow from the mountains near morache, very near <line> <line>the home-town of señora luz. my real work is hotel maid, and i’ve got <line> <line>a nice job, at a place called the tricontinental.” <line> <line>then you paused, and i felt how clearly <line> <line>you’d presented yourself, as americans do, with your job, <line> <line>your état civil, and i said: “i’m a graduate student <line> <line>at nyu, where luz studies, no, not married, no children ...” <line> <line>i tried to add something else at once, to leave this less ... <line> <line>definitive, but nothing came, so we ran through bridge-rumors, <line> <line>and soon we were hardly listening, waiting <line> <line>for our own next word, and laughing at our gabble. pequita <line> <line>told us what the priest had said <line> <line>about the drilling; you spoke of pequita’s <line> <line>first communion, and none of us could stop <line> <line>finding striking things to say. next day you came over <line> <line>to see my plants, and i came back for soup-supper, looking up <line> <line>at my windows, which in the easy half-yellow light <line> <line>of autumn looked oddly beckoning. as we ate, <line> <line>you leaned forward, with a sudden rogue’s smile, <line> <line>and mockingly proposed that we three walk across the bridge, <line> <line>“there’s a path up there. if the bridge <line> <line>is bad, we’ll tell off the mayor—” (in what spirit, i wondered, <line> <line>had you listened to our committee?) and when i got home <line> <line>i looked down, and through your sheer curtains saw you <line> <line>cleaning up, and pequita, at the table, reading.iv <line> <line>but next week, instead of the plank stair <line> <line>that zigzags up the anchorage-side, we wandered <line> <line>the riverside shipping alleys. from below, we could see <line> <line>overhead the under-arch of the bridge, and feel <line> <line>the resonant top-thrum of westbound <line> <line>subways and trucks. then the riverside—i loved <line> <line>this part. a sort of post-industrial fenworld, with tiny <line> <line>terrace houses, big dredger-parts laid aside <line> <line>from the drillings, and abandoned wreckers’ lots <line> <line>filled with sea-floor light and trembling, long-awned <line> <line>panicles of switchgrass. its timelessness <line> <line>soothed me—though ephemeral. even that day, one freshly <line> <line>tuckpointed facade, and a pair of brandnew bronze <line> <line>edwardian mermaid doorknockers. i could see <line> <line>our quarter five years from now, say—the withering <line> <line>discount chains, tentative boutiques, <line> <line>and mother and daughter figuring, to the upscale <line> <line>“pioneers,” as neighborhood indigenes, living on <line> <line>with strange literalness among them, supplying <line> <line>their just-permissible quantum of urban grit. <line> <line>you were ahead, and pequita trailed us, rattling weed stalks <line> <line>with a stray lath. as we progressed in and out <line> <line>of the endspan’s slatted shadows, you turned <line> <line>and called me into a side-lot—sunken concrete, flask- <line> <line>green puddles, to a broken-off building wall. it had been <line> <line>interior, once—rows of soiled roomsized <line> <line>plaster squares trailing sawn pipes, with one high trembling <line> <line>toilet, like a pearl. in a lower square, fringed <line> <line>with ailanthus and barbs of gang graffiti, <line> <line>was a mural. muy latino: the mountain <line> <line>dreaming the city: a terrace cafe with palm trees <line> <line>and a dancer shawled in black lace, with inward-angled <line> <line>castanets. and you lifted yourself on tiptoe, <line> <line>pilar, to touch the lace, as you might have grazed <line> <line>pequita’s cheek. i felt a pang, as if i already needed you <line> <line>sturdy inside your sturdy body, not this gesture <line> <line>as if, exiled within, you reached out— we stepped <line> <line>back, museum-wise, to contemplate, and you said: <line> <line>“luz likes to say i’m some mountain-woman, but when <line> <line>my mother died, i lived with my aunt in the city—i only <line> <line>went back when i married.” i told her i’d lived <line> <line>in this city, with a stepmother, who’d divorced my uncle <line> <line>to marry my father; and beat me. “a stepmother’s <line> <line>a curse of god,” you said gently. and on the walk back, <line> <line>pointed out more wall palms, beaches, until new york <line> <line>seemed a dot in a belt of capitals <line> <line>high on the globe: world-cities, packed <line> <line>with immigrants, refugees, gastarbeiter: a snowy <line> <line>latitude suffused with tropical nostalgia.v <line> <line>we were a threesome. coffee, suppers, tv, <line> <line>pequita at my computer—you’d asked me to teach her— <line> <line>or sleeping on my sofa, one bad month <line> <line>they moved you to night shift. yet only that summer, <line> <line>i’d worked in my window like a scholar <line> <line>in a lamplit bay, the night filled with myriad noises, <line> <line>like roman juvenal, to whose ears “came ever <line> <line>the sounds of buildings collapsing.” across, the two <line> <line>tenement-faces, florid, all bucrania, meanders, dusky trails <line> <line>of fire-escape bedding. and everything underlit <line> <line>by the sinister, slow-stopping car lights of our street. <line> <line>but now it was the dailiness of two <line> <line>from another hemisphere. through snow-fissures, winds fluting <line> <line>on railings and building-flaws, pilar in her low frame <line> <line>paced with armfuls of laundry, washed <line> <line>in the sink and hung to dry everywhere. the thousand <line> <line>stratagems of those who simply must not spend; <line> <line>and the tiny mother-decisions: though you preferred <line> <line>periphery, housekeeping around her, <line> <line>you’d make yourself interrupt her, to mop <line> <line>behind your sweeping. and pequita—i saw her wrap <line> <line>you up on the sofa when you had flu, and bring you <line> <line>orange juice, as they’d taught her in school, for she <line> <line>loved you, she was the person who loved you— <line> <line>i saw too, that of what i wanted the university <line> <line>to be for me—a tiny model of the city <line> <line>with its own rules and subsets: “tell me <line> <line>each day who i am”—you’d found your part <line> <line>in pequita; i followed the shape <line> <line>of your day touching center as it funneled <line> <line>into her hand and moving pencil-point.vi <line> <line>for everything seemed natural to pequita: <line> <line>the credo, her photocopied choir music <line> <line>piled beside the tidy prie-dieu, <line> <line>our neighborhood of syringe-filled gutters, drug-stoops and pimps, <line> <line>her school’s turkey cutouts, metal detectors, backed-up toilets ... <line> <line>our human wilderness, half-urban, half-surreal <line> <line>to her was a matter-of-fact eden, like the picturesque ruins <line> <line>and laughably rococo grottoes imagined <line> <line>by the seicento as the golden age. <line> <line>—and i, i thought her whole world, it comes back— <line> <line>touching, as if her child’s paradisial will were there <line> <line>for my affectionate recreation, like our still faithfully, <line> <line>occasionally, typed-up and dispatched <line> <line>protests from the ramp committee to the mayor. slight effects <line> <line>of perspective, tiny human gestures <line> <line>giving point to the city’s vast, ironic beauty.part twovii <line> <line>at a moment when no one was thinking <line> <line>about her, pequita awoke. perhaps <line> <line>she enjoyed the solitude, pilar asleep, <line> <line>me asleep across the street. she got up <line> <line>and stood on the cheap oval bathroom rug <line> <line>before the sink. at seven the drills started, <line> <line>deeper-toned than ever before (they woke me)— <line> <line>and part of your ceiling fell in; a beam <line> <line>splintered, plummeting straight to the oval rug— <line> <line>the person screaming over the phone <line> <line>was pilar. i thought it must be really <line> <line>all right, or she’d be crying not screaming, <line> <line>but when i’d called 911 and run over, pequita <line> <line>was barely alive. <line> <line>then the hospital corridors, <line> <line>me trying to close my winter coat <line> <line>(the buttons were off) on my nightgown, you <line> <line>on a bench, staring straight ahead. <line> <line>when they said pequita was <line> <line>“gone,” you were utterly silent. i brought you <line> <line>to my place (though our street was a tangle <line> <line>of police lights and yellow tape), terrified <line> <line>of your fixed inner focus, as if you had <line> <line>a plan ... next night i had luz stay over, <line> <line>i slept at her place; the third i was back. you, <line> <line>thank god (i thought), were crying, and luz <line> <line>had set up the service. she propelled us downstairs <line> <line>and to a tiny brick church i must often have passed <line> <line>without seeing it, two blocks inland. <line> <line>egg-blue inside, it was, with a little green <line> <line>and gilt altar, dark stations on the walls, <line> <line>and the statue of the virgin of guadeloupe <line> <line>placed oddly below the altar stairs, so that pilar, <line> <line>after the death-mass, could kneel <line> <line>before her, praying straight into her face, <line> <line>while i on a kneeler buried mine in my hands. <line> <line>what would the mother live for now, the hotel, me, or luz, <line> <line>already writing more endless mad letters? yet only these <line> <line>had from the city real answers: they’d brace the drill site <line> <line>with vibration-absorbing piers; and they wanted <line> <line>her and her friend mrs. citrin to know <line> <line>“that no one else had been more than lightly injured.”viii <line> <line>it was the end of winter, very dark. the building <line> <line>managers, nervy, had moved you to the first floor <line> <line>next door, till you found a new place (i knew <line> <line>you weren’t looking). each day i saw you <line> <line>arrive from work, answer my call tersely, <line> <line>then pull down your blinds. a shadow showed rarely, <line> <line>flattened, shapeless; you lay on your sofa a lot. <line> <line>“thanks anne—i’m better without company,” or <line> <line>“please understand.” but often, later <line> <line>in the evening, you’d come down the stairs <line> <line>and turn inland. then, one morning as i was passing <line> <line>with early groceries, you were leaving the parish hall <line> <line>in your black winter coat, heavily scarved, <line> <line>and we paused. approvingly, you tapped one glove <line> <line>on my armload—you’d told me to cook more, dictated <line> <line>recipes. i asked if this had been pequita’s <line> <line>choir-practice place; the sentence wavered, <line> <line>but you replied with grim joy, <line> <line>“she’s not practicing now.” it took me a minute. <line> <line>pequita was singing, this moment, in the presence. <line> <line>still what you felt most (it was in your face) <line> <line>was absence, absence, but from something bitter <line> <line>in your eyes, that seemed small and round with the cold, i felt <line> <line>your desire to exclude me and our old collusive ironies. <line> <line>what were such luxuries now, ironies, anglo friends; <line> <line>and i thought you hated my mind <line> <line>that remembered the brownpapered books, <line> <line>the orange juice. i reached to touch your arm—to get past <line> <line>this, but no, you had to get home: <line> <line>“i fasted for communion”; and your eyes <line> <line>swerved away. all my laughable, <line> <line>my lovely, delusional studies, that i’d seen you <line> <line>sort through for pequita, were now an affront. and yet <line> <line>i felt you moving behind your own mind, as if <line> <line>with something held in reserve ...ix <line> <line>but then you stopped answering the phone, went <line> <line>less often to church. what i thought <line> <line>was that you were angry (certainly i was). perhaps <line> <line>i thought you needed to talk, and i’d visit you <line> <line>in manhattan. so one morning in march, <line> <line>in the black coat i’d got for the funeral, i walked east <line> <line>from the forty-second street lexington stop <line> <line>to the three-story, fairy-lit jungle atrium <line> <line>of the tricontinental, and went to the seventh floor, <line> <line>where you started. there was a cart in the hall, <line> <line>a gleaming chrome maid’s cart half-projecting <line> <line>from a bedroom. on its sides were rows <line> <line>of glasses with lace sani-bonnets, gold- <line> <line>stamped mini-soaps and deodorants. it moved out, <line> <line>and you stood in the door with a sheet-load, looking fat <line> <line>in a starchy pink uniform monogrammedpilar. when you saw me, you dropped the sheets <line> <line>and in pain, pressed both palms to your cheeks, <line> <line>and looked at me looking at you. when <line> <line>i started sobbing, you took my shoulder and backed me <line> <line>to the elevator. pressed the button, stepped back, <line> <line>and then, to my surprise, gave me a sudden hug <line> <line>before pushing me in.x <line> <line>it had been always this half-connected <line> <line>and tenuous, our friendship. what light on my own <line> <line>isolation and need, that i hadn’t known. <line> <line>but you actually called me, that week, to propose <line> <line>our old joke, a bridge walk—maybe saturday? <line> <line>your voice in my ears sounded wobbly <line> <line>with tension, held-backness, so i got in first: <line> <line>a friend had wound up her doctorate and left me <line> <line>a minute village studio starting june ... after that <line> <line>i could listen, somber, as you poured out <line> <line>your need to leave, luz’s cousin, the possible <line> <line>hotel job “right in la.” you added “anne,” and broke off. <line> <line>“well, i’ll tell you that later. look, it may <line> <line>snow on saturday, ok?” “i don’t care.” and before <line> <line>you hung up, i’d resigned you, <line> <line>given you up. we’d part, on my side <line> <line>in anger, on yours in oblivion. i met you <line> <line>at the foot of the anchorage stair <line> <line>(not the eastern approach, with its easy grade <line> <line>near the ramp site). we climbed through the snow, <line> <line>slowly, pausing at landings for different <line> <line>views of our old alley world. like a museum <line> <line>of disused urban functions—we noted a bricked-over <line> <line>backyard privy arch, and from higher, roof-huts, inkily distinct, <line> <line>of old-style tenement dumbwaiters. the whole scene <line> <line>thrown out of drawing by one of those giant <line> <line>nyc cable-spools, charred at the bottom <line> <line>where some homeless had tried to burn it. <line> <line>the moist snow was sweeping <line> <line>through the cable tower when we clambered <line> <line>onto the path beneath it. as we moved, hunched slightly, <line> <line>onto the mainspan, the whole city abruptly <line> <line>whited-out to a monochrome geometry <line> <line>of vertical and stooping gray lines. i thought <line> <line>how pequita would have loved it, and caught <line> <line>her mother’s eye. we went on cautiously, soon <line> <line>pausing to stamp our boots and look over the rail <line> <line>at the traffic lanes below us. “anne, what <line> <line>i started to say before—this is it: i’m sorry <line> <line>i didn’t talk to you—you understand?” “of course,” <line> <line>i lied aimlessly. but you, glancing sideways, <line> <line>“but i’m really sorry ...” “no, really ...” you shook <line> <line>your head slightly, then took my arm. “okay then— <line> <line>what’s this thing?” pointing a snowy boot <line> <line>at a bolt as high as our knees, with a rusted-on octagonal <line> <line>nut: “it’s just a bolt.” you tapped your glove on a strut— <line> <line>“strut,” i provided. and you said, pompously, in luz’ very <line> <line>intonations (in what spirit had you <line> <line>listened?)—“the tolerances just aren’t there.” <line> <line>then, feeling easier, we started naming everything— <line> <line>spikes, spun-wire vertical cables: english, <line> <line>spanish, and then i heard you speak quiché (words once <line> <line>for vines, for split trunks <line> <line>over gorges?) but everything on the bridge was <line> <line>shabby, neglected-looking; and you said <line> <line>soberly: “if anyone was supposed <line> <line>to look after this bridge, he’s forgot all about it.” <line> <line>we didn’t link arms again, but started back, pausing <line> <line>to throw a few loose snowballs <line> <line>on the manhattan traffic below us. we’d go <line> <line>our separate ways—i’d go on delaying, skirting <line> <line>around my burnt-out places; you’d go <line> <line>where you could, forget what you could— <line> <line>some job-like relinquishment of inquiry <line> <line>or thought; organisms tend to persist ... when <line> <line>we got down to the massive base <line> <line>of the anchorage, we managed a hug <line> <line>that took in our past, at least: one embrace <line> <line>of two black winter coats in the snow. <line>","relationships,friends & enemies,social commentaries,cities & urban life,class,money & economics,race & ethnicity"

why hide the razor? why speak so sharply? why no mums? no dads? at night in his bed, listening to the breathing of all the other boys in the long room, he also asked himself, why me? <line> <line> <line> <line>when the house mothers changed shifts, there were always some unsupervised minutes, and that’s when the boys sprang into swashbuckling. q loved leaping from bed to bed with an imaginary sword in hand. en garde! <line> <line> <line> <line>• <line> <line>at sixteen, with a razor cut on his chin from the new trial of shaving himself, q stood at the doors of the royal flower hall. he was quaking. this was the very first day of work in his life. he’d been supposed to be a shop assistant, a quotidian job like those of the other orphans who were all sent out to live as apprentices — to return only if found unsuitable. however, the royal flower keeper had stepped in and demanded to know the name of the boy meant to be sent to the local florist, and now young q was called to prep flowers for the queen. <line> <line>“can’t someone else do it?” he quailed as the flower keeper handed him a quilloned silver thorn knife. q didn’t want to be found unsuitable. <line> <line>he quivered as thousands of roses arrived — he was supposed to separate their long, tangled stems, cut off the thorns, and queue them up straight on the tables for the arrangers. <line> <line>“but i’m new!” q cried. he couldn’t quell his horror at the prospect of lifting a real blade to cut the thorns. <line> <line> <line>“look, dear, no quibbling. if you work here, you’re qualified,” the flower keeper said. her knuckles bloomed out of the crooked stems of her hands. “hold the knife with two fingers behind this little crossbar, that’s the quillon, and snip under the thorn.” she did it with elegant speed. one thorn gone. <line> <line>“it’s like swordsmanship,” the flower keeper joked, wielding her knife, fencing in miniature mime. in q’s head rang the orders of the house mothers, “don’t touch!” but in his fingers lay his imaginary weapon come alive. <line> <line>“no time to be quiescent,” she said. “equipoise is all.” <line> <line> <line> <line>don’t quit now, q said to himself. if he quit, he’d have to slink back to the orphanage, a failed apprentice, instead of going home to his newly found haven, a cold-water flat with a coin-operated heater, all his own. there he’d store the new paring knife his paycheck would buy, the pointed scissors ... so q quashed his fear and set to work. <line> <line>• <line> <line>he began to duel through the roses. <line> <line>“en garde!” he whispered, lunging toward his petaled quarry. <line> <line>soon there were thorns everywhere (some a bit bloody), but he did not make any big mistakes. he wasn’t perfect, like the flower keeper, but he was catching on. like quicksilver she flashed her knife, each stem quickening with the sharpest cut. instinctively q used the quartata maneuver, a quarter turn to the inside, protecting himself as he flicked each thorn into the quagmire of floral detritus on the floor. with each toss of the thorn he added to what appeared to the flower keeper to be his nascent gift. <line> <line>as the lorries loaded with rose baskets and vases and bowls roared off to the palace, he quietly pocketed a thorn. then the first question he’d ever spoken aloud curlicued to his lips. and because he’d had to save up this query for sixteen years, he posed the essential one, previously mouthed only to himself at night in bed: <line> <line>pourquoi? <line> <line>“why,” said the flower keeper, “for the equerry, of course. and he for the queen. you know who she is.” <line> <line>“just a flower of a figurehead,” q quipped. <line> <line> <line> <line>the boy’s quick-witted, the flower keeper thought, and said, “we’ll require you tomorrow.” <line> <line>and for quadruple tomorrows after that and after that, until q began to accumulate expertise. know-how defines a person, especially someone who’s grown up watching his ps and qs. he no longer quavered, quadrillions of roses now quasi-ordinary, royal waste a quiddity. <line> <line> <line> <line>i’m not a quitter, he’d said to himself, and each night went back to his cold-water flat where he had enshrined that little thorn in a matchbox. <line> <line>• <line> <line>well, he didn’t live in a cold-water flat now. now he lived in a sunlit house with a stash of razors in the marble bathroom and, in the drawers of his magnificent kitchen, a motherlode of paring knives, bread knives, steak knives, bird’s beak parers, boning knives, cheese knives, chef’s, clam, and carving knives, filleters, and mincers. <line> <line>now q was senior keeper of the royal flower hall, walking across a stage toward the queen herself. he had kept the talisman thorn from his very first day with the roses. just that afternoon he had taken it out and dropped it in the pocket of his tuxedo, anticipating touching it for luck before he received his award from her majesty. <line> <line>but when the queen posed her standard question, “have you come a long way?” q was quite bewildered as to how to answer. <line> <line>sometimes a simple question cuts into an aromatic world of mysteries. but we must learn to answer, to cut. q, his distinguished silver hair perfectly trimmed, his neck properly shaved, looked down at the curls on the queen’s forehead and remembered his first unspoken word, why. <line> <line>a quixotic word, an essential thorn. it had pricked him awake, into manhood. <line> <line>arrangements of roses passed through his mind — how those magnificats of magentas quenched his imagination. how the choral crooning of pale pinks calmed his qualms. among roses he had reached his quintessence. <line> <line>yet, is it a large enough life, to arrange roses for a queen? when the whole world out there hurtled toward famine and war? he hadn’t intended to stay, to make a future in flowers, taking people’s breath away with something so spectacularly unnecessary as his rose floats. he had been a thorn in someone’s side, spectacularly unnecessary himself. he’d been sent out into the world alone, blunted by the unknown facts of his identity — his search for his parents rewarded only by locked doors, locked cabinets, and, later, graveyards. <line> <line>patiently her majesty waited for his answer. in physical distance he had come a short way, but he’d swashbuckled miles to reach the end of his quest. <line> <line>“only from kew gardens, your highness,” q answered simply at last. <line> <line>then she put into his palm the royal thank-you, in a quilted sleeve: a silver rose wreath made from an ancient mold that gave it stylized petals, prickly leaves, and, cut in at the bottom of the circle, a thorn. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>“q from alphabetique,” 2013 by kara kosaka <line> <line> <line>","living,life choices,activities,travels & journeys,nature,trees & flowers"

the clouds go dashing at each other and sheer away just in time. whoop! and a man’s hat careers down the street in front of the white dust, leaps into the branches of a tree, veers away and trundles ahead of the wind, jarring the sunlight into spokes of rose-colour and green. a motor-car cuts a swathe through the bright air, sharp-beaked, irresistible, shouting to the wind to make way. a glare of dust and sunshine tosses together behind it, and settles down. the sky is quiet and high, and the morning is fair with fresh-washed air. midday and afternoon swirl of crowded streets. shock and recoil of traffic. the stock-still brick façade of an old church, against which the waves of people lurch and withdraw. flare of sunshine down side-streets. eddies of light in the windows of chemists’ shops, with their blue, gold, purple jars, darting colours far into the crowd. loud bangs and tremors, murmurings out of high windows, whirring of machine belts, blurring of horses and motors. a quick spin and shudder of brakes on an electric car, and the jar of a church-bell knocking against the metal blue of the sky. i am a piece of the town, a bit of blown dust, thrust along with the crowd. proud to feel the pavement under me, reeling with feet. feet tripping, skipping, lagging, dragging, plodding doggedly, or springing up and advancing on firm elastic insteps. a boy is selling papers, i smell them clean and new from the press. they are fresh like the air, and pungent as tulips and narcissus. the blue sky pales to lemon, and great tongues of gold blind the shop-windows, putting out their contents in a flood of flame. night and sleep the day takes her ease in slippered yellow. electric signs gleam out along the shop fronts, following each other. they grow, and grow, and blow into patterns of fire-flowers as the sky fades. trades scream in spots of light at the unruffled night. twinkle, jab, snap, that means a new play; and over the way: plop, drop, quiver, is the sidelong sliver of a watchmaker’s sign with its length on another street. a gigantic mug of beer effervesces to the atmosphere over a tall building, but the sky is high and has her own stars, why should she heed ours? i leave the city with speed. wheels whirl to take me back to my trees and my quietness. the breeze which blows with me is fresh-washed and clean, it has come but recently from the high sky. there are no flowers in bloom yet, but the earth of my garden smells of tulips and narcissus. my room is tranquil and friendly. out of the window i can see the distant city, a band of twinkling gems, little flower-heads with no stems. i cannot see the beer-glass, nor the letters of the restaurants and shops i passed, now the signs blur and all together make the city, glowing on a night of fine weather, like a garden stirring and blowing for the spring. the night is fresh-washed and fair and there is a whiff of flowers in the air. wrap me close, sheets of lavender. pour your blue and purple dreams into my ears. the breeze whispers at the shutters and mutters queer tales of old days, and cobbled streets, and youths leaping their horses down marble stairways. pale blue lavender, you are the colour of the sky when it is fresh-washed and fair . . . i smell the stars . . . they are like tulips and narcissus . . . i smell them in the air. <line>","life choices,activities,eating & drinking,nature,spring,stars, planets, heavens,trees & flowers,social commentaries,cities & urban life"

11605,12996,"<line> <line>that story which the bold sir bedivere, first made and latest left of all the knights, told, when the man was no more than a voice in the white winter of his age, to those with whom he dwelt, new faces, other minds. for on their march to westward, bedivere, who slowly paced among the slumbering host, heard in his tent the moanings of the king: ""i found him in the shining of the stars, i mark'd him in the flowering of his fields, but in his ways with men i find him not. i waged his wars, and now i pass and die. o me! for why is all around us here as if some lesser god had made the world, but had not force to shape it as he would, till the high god behold it from beyond, and enter it, and make it beautiful? or else as if the world were wholly fair, but that these eyes of men are dense and dim, and have not power to see it as it is: perchance, because we see not to the close;— for i, being simple, thought to work his will, and have but stricken with the sword in vain; and all whereon i lean'd in wife and friend is traitor to my peace, and all my realm reels back into the beast, and is no more. my god, thou hast forgotten me in my death: nay—god my christ—i pass but shall not die."" then, ere that last weird battle in the west, there came on arthur sleeping, gawain kill'd in lancelot's war, the ghost of gawain blown along a wandering wind, and past his ear went shrilling, ""hollow, hollow all delight! hail, king! to-morrow thou shalt pass away. farewell! there is an isle of rest for thee. and i am blown along a wandering wind, and hollow, hollow, hollow all delight."" and fainter onward, like wild birds that change their season in the night and wail their way from cloud to cloud, down the long wind the dream shrill'd; but in going mingled with dim cries far in the moonlit haze among the hills, as of some lonely city sack'd by night, when all is lost, and wife and child with wail pass to new lords; and arthur woke and call'd, ""who spake? a dream. o light upon the wind, thine, gawain, was the voice—are these dim cries thine? or doth all that haunts the waste and wild mourn, knowing it will go along with me?"" this heard the bold sir bedivere and spake: ""o me, my king, let pass whatever will, elves, and the harmless glamour of the field; but in their stead thy name and glory cling to all high places like a golden cloud for ever: but as yet thou shalt not pass. light was gawain in life, and light in death is gawain, for the ghost is as the man; and care not thou for dreams from him, but rise— i hear the steps of modred in the west, and with him many of thy people, and knights once thine, whom thou hast loved, but grosser grown than heathen, spitting at their vows and thee. right well in heart they know thee for the king. arise, go forth and conquer as of old."" then spake king arthur to sir bedivere: ""far other is this battle in the west whereto we move, than when we strove in youth, and brake the petty kings, and fought with rome, or thrust the heathen from the roman wall, and shook him thro' the north. ill doom is mine to war against my people and my knights. the king who fights his people fights himself. and they my knights, who loved me once, the stroke that strikes them dead is as my death to me. yet let us hence, and find or feel a way thro' this blind haze, which ever since i saw one lying in the dust at almesbury, hath folded in the passes of the world."" then rose the king and moved his host by night, and ever push'd sir modred, league by league, back to the sunset bound of lyonnesse— a land of old upheaven from the abyss by fire, to sink into the abyss again; where fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt, and the long mountains ended in a coast of ever-shifting sand, and far away the phantom circle of a moaning sea. there the pursuer could pursue no more, and he that fled no further fly the king; and there, that day when the great light of heaven burn'd at his lowest in the rolling year, on the waste sand by the waste sea they closed. nor ever yet had arthur fought a fight like this last, dim, weird battle of the west. a deathwhite mist slept over sand and sea: whereof the chill, to him who breathed it, drew down with his blood, till all his heart was cold with formless fear; and ev'n on arthur fell confusion, since he saw not whom he fought. for friend and foe were shadows in the mist, and friend slew friend not knowing whom he slew; and some had visions out of golden youth, and some beheld the faces of old ghosts look in upon the battle; and in the mist was many a noble deed, many a base, and chance and craft and strength in single fights, and ever and anon with host to host shocks, and the splintering spear, the hard mail hewn, shield-breakings, and the clash of brands, the crash of battleaxes on shatter'd helms, and shrieks after the christ, of those who falling down look'd up for heaven, and only saw the mist; and shouts of heathen and the traitor knights, oaths, insult, filth, and monstrous blasphemies, sweat, writhings, anguish, labouring of the lungs in that close mist, and cryings for the light, moans of the dying, and voices of the dead. last, as by some one deathbed after wail of suffering, silence follows, or thro' death or deathlike swoon, thus over all that shore, save for some whisper of the seething seas, a dead hush fell; but when the dolorous day grew drearier toward twilight falling, came a bitter wind, clear from the north, and blew the mist aside, and with that wind the tide rose, and the pale king glanced across the field of battle: but no man was moving there; nor any cry of christian heard thereon, nor yet of heathen; only the wan wave brake in among dead faces, to and fro swaying the helpless hands, and up and down tumbling the hollow helmets of the fallen, and shiver'd brands that once had fought with rome, and rolling far along the gloomy shores the voice of days of old and days to be. then spake king arthur to sir bedivere, and whiter than the mist that all day long had held the field of battle was the king: ""hearest thou this great voice that shakes the world, and wastes the narrow realm whereon we move, and beats upon the faces of the dead, my dead, as tho' they had not died for me?— o bedivere, for on my heart hath fall'n confusion, till i know not what i am, nor whence i am, nor whether i be king. behold, i seem but king among the dead."" then spake the bold sir bedivere: ""my king, king everywhere! and so the dead have kings, there also will i worship thee as king. yet still thy life is whole, and still i live who love thee; but who hates thee, he that brought the heathen back among us, yonder stands, modred, unharm'd, the traitor of thine house."" then spake the king: ""my house hath been my doom. but call not thou this traitor of my house who hath but dwelt beneath one roof with me. my house are rather they who sware my vows, yea, even while they brake them, own'd me king. and well for thee, saying in my dark hour, when all the purport of my throne hath fail'd, that quick or dead thou hottest me for king. king am i, whatsoever be their cry; and one last act of kinghood shalt thou see yet, ere i pass."" and uttering this the king made at the man: then modred smote his liege hard on that helm which many a heathen sword had beaten thin; while arthur at one blow, striking the last stroke with excalibur, slew him, and all but slain himself, he fell. so all day long the noise of battle roll'd among the mountains by the winter sea; until king arthur's table, man by man, had fall'n in lyonnesse about their lord, king arthur. then, because his wound was deep, the bold sir bedivere uplifted him, and bore him to a chapel nigh the field, a broken chancel with a broken cross, that stood on a dark strait of barren land: on one side lay the ocean, and on one lay a great water, and the moon was full. then spake king arthur to sir bedivere: ""the sequel of to-day unsolders all the goodliest fellowship of famous knights whereof this world holds record. such a sleep they sleep—the men i loved. i think that we shall never more, at any future time, delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds, walking about the gardens and the halls of camelot, as in the days that were. i perish by this people which i made,— tho' merlin sware that i should come again to rule once more; but, let what will be, be, i am so deeply smitten thro' the helm that without help i cannot last till morn. thou therefore take my brand excalibur, which was my pride: for thou rememberest how in those old days, one summer noon, an arm rose up from out the bosom of the lake, clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, holding the sword—and how i row'd across and took it, and have worn it, like a king; and, wheresoever i am sung or told in aftertime, this also shall be known: but now delay not: take excalibur, and fling him far into the middle mere: watch what thou seëst, and lightly bring me word."" to him replied the bold sir bedivere: ""it is not meet, sir king, to leave thee thus, aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm— a little thing may harm a wounded man; yet i thy hest will all perform at full, watch what i see, and lightly bring thee word."" so saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept, and in the moon athwart the place of tombs, where lay the mighty bones of ancient men, old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. he, stepping down by zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock, came on the shining levels of the lake. there drew he forth the brand excalibur, and o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon, brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth and sparkled keen with frost against the hilt: for all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks, myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work of subtlest jewellery. he gazed so long that both his eyes were dazzled as he stood, this way and that dividing the swift mind, in act to throw: but at the last it seem'd better to leave excalibur conceal'd there in the many-knotted waterflags, that whistled stiff and dry about the marge. so strode he back slow to the wounded king. then spake king arthur to sir bedivere: ""hast thou perform'd my mission which i gave? what is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?"" and answer made the bold sir bedivere: ""i heard the ripple washing in the reeds, and the wild water lapping on the crag."" to whom replied king arthur, faint and pale: ""thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name, not rendering true answer, as beseem'd thy fealty, nor like a noble knight: for surer sign had follow'd, either hand or voice, or else a motion of the mere. this is a shameful thing for men to lie. yet now, i charge thee, quickly go again, as thou art lief and dear, and do the thing i bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word."" then went sir bedivere the second time across the ridge, and paced beside the mere, counting the dewy pebbles, fix'd in thought; but when he saw the wonder of the hilt, how curiously and strangely chased, he smote his palms together, and he cried aloud: ""and if indeed i cast the brand away, surely a precious thing, one worthy note, should thus be lost for ever from the earth, which might have pleased the eyes of many men. what good should follow this, if this were done? what harm, undone? deep harm to disobey, seeing obedience is the bond of rule. were it well to obey then, if a king demand an act unprofitable, against himself? the king is sick, and knows not what he does. what record, or what relic of my lord should be to aftertime, but empty breath and rumours of a doubt? but were this kept, stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings, some one might show it at a joust of arms, saying, 'king arthur's sword, excalibur, wrought by the lonely maiden of the lake. nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps upon the hidden bases of the hills.' so might some old man speak in the aftertime to all the people, winning reverence. but now much honour and much fame were lost."" so spake he, clouded with his own conceit, and hid excalibur the second time, and so strode back slow to the wounded king. then spoke king arthur, breathing heavily: ""what is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?' and answer made the bold sir bedivere: ""i heard the water lapping on the crag, and the long ripple washing in the reeds."" to whom replied king arthur, much in wrath: ""ah, miserable and unkind, untrue, unknightly, traitor-hearted! woe is me! authority forgets a dying king, laid widow'd of the power in his eye that bow'd the will. i see thee what thou art, for thou, the latest-left of all my knights, in whom should meet the offices of all, thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt; either from lust of gold, or like a girl valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes. yet, for a man may fail in duty twice, and the third time may prosper, get thee hence: but, if thou spare to fling excalibur, i will arise and slay thee with my hands."" then quickly rose sir bedivere, and ran, and, leaping down the ridges, lightly, plunged among the bulrush beds, and clutch'd the sword, and strongly wheel'd and threw it. the great brand made lightnings in the splendour of the moon, and flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch, shot like a streamer of the northern morn, seen where the moving isles of winter shock by night, with noises of the northern sea. so flash'd and fell the brand excalibur: but ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm clothed in white samite, mystic wonderful, and caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him three times, and drew him under in the mere. and lightly went the other to the king. then spoke king arthur, drawing thicker breath: ""now see i by thine eyes that this is done. speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?"" and answer made the bold sir bedivere: ""sir king, i closed mine eyelids, lest the gems should blind my purpose, for i never saw, nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till i die, not tho' i live three lives of mortal men, so great a miracle as yonder hilt. then with both hands i flung him, wheeling him; but when i look'd again, behold an arm, clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, that caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him three times, and drew him under in the mere."" and answer made king arthur, breathing hard: ""my end draws nigh; 'tis time that i were gone. make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight, and bear me to the margin; yet i fear my wound hath taken cold, and i shall die."" so saying, from the pavement he half rose, slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm, and looking wistfully with wide blue eyes as in a picture. him sir bedivere remorsefully regarded thro' his tears, and would have spoken, but he found not words; then took with care, and kneeling on one knee, o'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands, and rising bore him thro' the place of tombs. but, as he walk'd, king arthur panted hard, like one that feels a nightmare on his bed when all the house is mute. so sigh'd the king, muttering and murmuring at his ear, ""quick, quick! i fear it is too late, and i shall die."" but the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge, clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk'd, larger than human on the frozen hills. he heard the deep behind him, and a cry before. his own thought drove him like a goad. dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves and barren chasms, and all to left and right the bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based his feet on juts of slippery crag that rang sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels— and on a sudden, lo! the level lake, and the long glories of the winter moon. then saw they how there hove a dusky barge, dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern, beneath them; and descending they were ware that all the decks were dense with stately forms, black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream—by these three queens with crowns of gold: and from them rose a cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars, and, as it were one voice, an agony of lamentation, like a wind that shrills all night in a waste land, where no one comes, or hath come, since the making of the world. then murmur'd arthur, ""place me in the barge."" so to the barge they came. there those three queens put forth their hands, and took the king, and wept. but she, that rose the tallest of them all and fairest, laid his head upon her lap, and loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his hands, and call'd him by his name, complaining loud, and dropping bitter tears against a brow striped with dark blood: for all his face was white and colourless, and like the wither'd moon smote by the fresh beam of the springing east; and all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops of onset; and the light and lustrous curls— that made his forehead like a rising sun high from the daïs-throne—were parch'd with dust or, clotted into points and hanging loose, mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips. so like a shatter'd column lay the king; not like that arthur who, with lance in rest, from spur to plume a star of tournament, shot thro' the lists at camelot, and charged before the eyes of ladies and of kings. then loudly cried the bold sir bedivere: ""ah! my lord arthur, whither shall i go? where shall i hide my forehead and my eyes? for now i see the true old times are dead, when every morning brought a noble chance, and every chance brought out a noble knight. such times have been not since the light that led the holy elders with the gift of myrrh. but now the whole round table is dissolved which was an image of the mighty world, and i, the last, go forth companionless, and the days darken round me, and the years, among new men, strange faces, other minds."" and slowly answer'd arthur from the barge: ""the old order changeth, yielding place to new, and god fulfils himself in many ways, lest one good custom should corrupt the world. comfort thyself: what comfort is in me? i have lived my life, and that which i have done may he within himself make pure! but thou, if thou shouldst never see my face again, pray for my soul. more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of. wherefore, let thy voice rise like a fountain for me night and day. for what are men better than sheep or goats that nourish a blind life within the brain, if, knowing god, they lift not hands of prayer both for themselves and those who call them friend? for so the whole round earth is every way bound by gold chains about the feet of god. but now farewell. i am going a long way with these thou seëst—if indeed i go (for all my mind is clouded with a doubt)— to the island-valley of avilion; where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow, nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard lawns and bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea, where i will heal me of my grievous wound."" so said he, and the barge with oar and sail moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan that, fluting a wild carol ere her death, ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood with swarthy webs. long stood sir bedivere revolving many memories, till the hull look'd one black dot against the verge of dawn, and on the mere the wailing died away. but when that moan had past for evermore, the stillness of the dead world's winter dawn amazed him, and he groan'd, the king is gone.'' and therewithal came on him the weird rhyme, ""from the great deep to the great deep he goes."" whereat he slowly turn'd and slowly clomb the last hard footstep of that iron crag; thence mark'd the black hull moving yet, and cried, ""he passes to be king among the dead, and after healing of his grievous wound he comes again; but—if he come no more— o me, be yon dark queens in yon black boat, who shriek'd and wail'd, the three whereat we gazed on that high day, when, clothed with living light, they stood before his throne in silence, friends of arthur, who should help him at his need?"" then from the dawn it seem'd there came, but faint as from beyond the limit of the world, like the last echo born of a great cry, sounds, as if some fair city were one voice around a king returning from his wars. thereat once more he moved about, and clomb ev'n to the highest he could climb, and saw, straining his eyes beneath an arch of hand, or thought he saw, the speck that bare the king, down that long water opening on the deep somewhere far off, pass on and on, and go from less to less and vanish into light. and the new sun rose bringing the new year. <line>","living,death,sorrow & grieving,mythology & folklore,fairy-tales & legends,heroes & patriotism"

be your cup <line> <line>each day my wings shelter <line> <line>your dear, momentary earth. <line> <line>my mind is several minds, i say, <line> <line>each abiding differently: in your eyes, <line>

<line>to touch the ground i touch in me <line> <line>when i speak to you. <line> <line>she says, a new mind makes the world new. <line> <line>true words are a little blue. <line> <line>and being human

11693,898,"<line> <line>hamelin town's in brunswick, by famous hanover city; the river weser, deep and wide, washes its wall on the southern side; a pleasanter spot you never spied; but, when begins my ditty, almost five hundred years ago, to see the townsfolk suffer so from vermin, was a pity. rats! they fought the dogs, and killed the cats, and bit the babies in the cradles, and eat the cheeses out of the vats, and licked the soup from the cooks' own ladles, split open the kegs of salted sprats, made nests inside men's sunday hats, and even spoiled the women's chats by drowning their speaking with shrieking and squeaking in fifty different sharps and flats. at last the people in a body to the town hall came flocking: 'tis clear, cried they, our mayor's a noddy; and as for our corporation — shocking to think we buy gowns lined with ermine for dolts that can't or won't determine what's like to rid us of our vermin! rouse up, sirs! give your brains a racking to find the remedy we're lacking, or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing! at this the mayor and corporation quaked with a mighty consternation. an hour they sate in council, at length the mayor broke silence: for a guilder i'd my ermine gown sell; i wish i were a mile hence! it's easy to bid one rack one's brain — i'm sure my poor head aches again i've scratched it so, and all in vain. oh for a trap, a trap, a trap! just as he said this, what should hap at the chamber door but a gentle tap? bless us, cried the mayor, what's that? (with the corporation as he sate, looking little though wondrous fat); only a scraping of shoes on the mat? anything like the sound of a rat makes my heart go pit-a-pat! come in! — the mayor cried, looking bigger: and in did come the strangest figure! his queer long coat from heel to head was half of yellow and half of red; and he himself was tall and thin, with sharp blue eyes, each like a pin, and light loose hair, yet swarthy skin, no tuft on cheek nor beard on chin, but lips where smiles went out and in — there was no guessing his kith and kin! and nobody could enough admire the tall man and his quaint attire: quoth one: it's as my great-grandsire, starting up at the trump of doom's tone, had walked this way from his painted tombstone! he advanced to the council-table: and, please your honours, said he, i'm able, by means of a secret charm, to draw all creatures living beneath the sun, that creep, or swim, or fly, or run, after me so as you never saw! and i chiefly use my charm on creatures that do people harm, the mole, and toad, and newt, and viper; and people call me the pied piper. (and here they noticed round his neck a scarf of red and yellow stripe, to match with his coat of the self-same cheque; and at the scarf's end hung a pipe; and his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying as if impatient to be playing upon this pipe, as low it dangled over his vesture so old-fangled.) yet, said he, poor piper as i am, in tartary i freed the cham, last june, from his huge swarms of gnats; i eased in asia the nizam of a monstrous brood of vampyre-bats: and, as for what your brain bewilders, if i can rid your town of rats will you give me a thousand guilders? one? fifty thousand! — was the exclamation of the astonished mayor and corporation. into the street the piper stept, smiling first a little smile, as if he knew what magic slept in his quiet pipe the while; then, like a musical adept, to blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled, and green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled, like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled; and ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered, you heard as if an army muttered; and the muttering grew to a grumbling; and the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling; and out of the houses the rats came tumbling. great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats, brown rats, black rats, grey rats, tawny rats, grave old plodders, gay young friskers, fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins, cocking tails and pricking whiskers, families by tens and dozens, brothers, sisters, husbands, wives — followed the piper for their lives. from street to street he piped advancing, and step for step they followed dancing, until they came to the river weser wherein all plunged and perished — save one who, stout as julius caesar, swam across and lived to carry (as he the manuscript he cherished) to rat-land home his commentary, which was, at the first shrill notes of the pipe, i heard a sound as of scraping tripe, and putting apples, wondrous ripe, into a cider-press's gripe: and a moving away of pickle-tub-boards, and a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards, and a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks, and a breaking the hoops of butter-casks; and it seemed as if a voice (sweeter than by harp or by psaltery is breathed) called out, oh rats, rejoice! the world is grown to one vast drysaltery! 'so munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon, 'breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon! and just as one bulky sugar-puncheon, ready staved, like a great sun shone glorious scarce an inch before me, just as methought it said, come, bore me! — i found the weser rolling o'er me. you should have heard the hamelin people ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple; go, cried the mayor, and get long poles! poke out the nests and block up the holes! consult with carpenters and builders, and leave in our town not even a trace of the rats! — when suddenly up the face of the piper perked in the market-place, with a, first, if you please, my thousand guilders! a thousand guilders! the mayor looked blue; so did the corporation too. for council dinners made rare havock with claret, moselle, vin-de-grave, hock; and half the money would replenish their cellar's biggest butt with rhenish. to pay this sum to a wandering fellow with a gipsy coat of red and yellow! beside, quoth the mayor with a knowing wink, our business was done at the river's brink; we saw with our eyes the vermin sink, and what's dead can't come to life, i think. so, friend, we're not the folks to shrink from the duty of giving you something for drink, and a matter of money to put in your poke; but, as for the guilders, what we spoke of them, as you very well know, was in joke. beside, our losses have made us thrifty; a thousand guilders! come, take fifty! the piper's face fell, and he cried, no trifling! i can't wait, beside! i've promised to visit by dinner time bagdat, and accept the prime of the head cook's pottage, all he's rich in, for having left, in the caliph's kitchen, of a nest of scorpions no survivor — with him i proved no bargain-driver, with you, don't think i'll bate a stiver! and folks who put me in a passion may find me pipe after another fashion. how? cried the mayor, d'ye think i'll brook being worse treated than a cook? insulted by a lazy ribald with idle pipe and vesture piebald? you threaten us, fellow? do your worst, blow your pipe there till you burst! once more he stept into the street; and to his lips again laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane; and ere he blew three notes (such sweet soft notes as yet musician's cunning never gave th'enraptured air) there was a rustling, that seem'd like a bustling of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling, small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering, little hands clapping, and little tongues chattering, and, like fowls in a farm-yard when barley is scattering, out came the children running. all the little boys and girls, with rosy cheeks and flaxen curls, and sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls, tripping and skipping, ran merrily after the wonderful music with shouting and laughter. the mayor was dumb, and the council stood as if they were changed into blocks of wood, unable to move a step, or cry to the children merrily skipping by — could only follow with the eye that joyous crowd at the piper's back. but how the mayor was on the rack, and the wretched council's bosoms beat, as the piper turned from the high street to where the weser rolled its waters right in the way of their sons and daughters! however he turned from south to west, and to coppelburg hill his steps addressed, and after him the children pressed; great was the joy in every breast. he never can cross that mighty top! he's forced to let the piping drop, and we shall see our children stop! when, lo, as they reached the mountain's side, a wondrous portal opened wide, as if a cavern was suddenly hollowed; and the piper advanced and the children follow'd, and when all were in to the very last, the door in the mountain side shut fast. did i say, all? no! one was lame, and could not dance the whole of the way; and in after years, if you would blame his sadness, he was used to say, — it's dull in our town since my playmates left! i can't forget that i'm bereft of all the pleasant sights they see, which the piper also promised me; for he led us, he said, to a joyous land, joining the town and just at hand, where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew, and flowers put forth a fairer hue, and every thing was strange and new; the sparrows were brighter than peacocks here, and their dogs outran our fallow deer, and honey-bees had lost their stings, and horses were born with eagles' wings: and just as i felt assured my lame foot would be speedily cured, the music stopped and i stood still, and found myself outside the hill, left alone against my will, to go now limping as before, and never hear of that country more! alas, alas for hamelin! there came into many a burgher's pate a text which says, that heaven's gate opes to the rich at as easy a rate as the needle's eye takes a camel in! the mayor sent east, west, north, and south, to offer the piper, by word of mouth, wherever it was men's lot to find him, silver and gold to his heart's content, if he'd only return the way he went, and bring the children behind him. but when they saw 'twas a lost endeavour, and piper and dancers were gone for ever, they made a decree that lawyers never should think their records dated duly if, after the day of the month and year, these words did not as well appear, ""and so long after what happened here ""on the twenty-second of july, ""thirteen hundred and seventy-six:"" and the better in memory to fix the place of the children's last retreat, they called it, the pied piper's street — where any one playing on pipe or tabor was sure for the future to lose his labour. nor suffered they hostelry or tavern to shock with mirth a street so solemn; but opposite the place of the cavern they wrote the story on a column, and on the great church window painted the same, to make the world acquainted how their children were stolen away; and there it stands to this very day. and i must not omit to say that in transylvania there's a tribe of alien people who ascribe the outlandish ways and dress on which their neighbours lay such stress to their fathers and mothers having risen out of some subterraneous prison into which they were trepanned long time ago in a mighty band out of hamelin town in brunswick land, but how or why, they don't understand. so, willy, let you and me be wipers of scores out with all men — especially pipers: and, whether they pipe us from rats or from mice, if we've promised them aught, let us keep our promise. <line>","arts & sciences,music,social commentaries,mythology & folklore"

<line>god's pamper'd people whom, debauch'd with ease, <line>no king could govern, nor no god could please; <line>(gods they had tri'd of every shape and size, <line>that god-smiths could produce, or priests devise:) <line>these adam-wits, too fortunately free, <line>began to dream they wanted liberty: <line>and when no rule, no precedent, was found <line>of men, by laws less circumscrib'd and bound, <line>they led their wild desires to woods and caves, <line>and thought that all but savages were slaves. <line>they who, when saul was dead, without a blow, <line>made foolish ishbosheth the crown forego; <line>who banisht david did from hebron bring, <line>and, with a general shout, proclaim'd him king: <line>those very jews, who, at their very best, <line>their humour more than loyalty exprest, <line>now, wonder'd why, so long, they had obey'd <line>an idol-monarch which their hands had made: <line>thought they might ruin him they could create; <line>or melt him to that golden calf, a state. <line>but these were random bolts: no form'd design, <line>nor interest made the factious crowd to join: <line>the sober part of israel, free from stain, <line>well knew the value of a peaceful reign: <line>and, looking backward with a wise afright, <line>saw seams of wounds, dishonest to the sight: <line>in contemplation of whose ugly scars, <line>they curst the memory of civil wars. <line>the moderate sort of men, thus qualifi'd, <line>inclin'd the balance to the better side: <line>and, david's mildness manag'd it so well, <line>the bad found no occasion to rebel. <line>but, when to sin our bias'd nature leans, <line>the careful devil is still at hand with means; <line>and providently pimps for ill desires: <line>the good old cause reviv'd, a plot requires. <line>plots, true or false, are necessary things, <line>to raise up common-wealths, and ruin kings. <line> <line> th' inhabitants of old jerusalem <line>were jebusites: the town so call'd from them; <line>and theirs the native right— <line>but when the chosen people grew more strong, <line>the rightful cause at length became the wrong: <line>and every loss the men of jebus bore, <line>they still were thought god's enemies the more. <line>thus, worn and weaken'd, well or ill content, <line>submit they must to david's government: <line>impoverish'd and depriv'd of all command, <line>their taxes doubled as they lost their land; <line>and, what was harder yet to flesh and blood, <line>their gods disgrac'd, and burnt like common wood. <line>this set the heathen priesthood in a flame; <line>for priests of all religions are the same: <line>of whatsoe'er descent their godhead be, <line>stock, stone, or other homely pedigree, <line>in his defence his servants are as bold, <line>as if he had been born of beaten gold. <line>the jewish rabbins though their enemies, <line>in this conclude them honest men and wise: <line>for 'twas their duty, all the learned think, <line>t'espouse his cause by whom they eat and drink. <line>from hence began that plot, the nation's curse, <line>bad in itself, but represented worse. <line>rais'd in extremes, and in extremes decri'd; <line>with oaths affirm'd, with dying vows deni'd. <line>not weigh'd, or winnow'd by the multitude; <line>but swallow'd in the mass, unchew'd and crude. <line>some truth there was, but dash'd and brew'd with lies; <line>to please the fools, and puzzle all the wise. <line>succeeding times did equal folly call, <line>believing nothing, or believing all. <line>th' egyptian rites the jebusites embrac'd; <line>where gods were recommended by their taste. <line>such sav'ry deities must needs be good, <line>as serv'd at once for worship and for food. <line>by force they could not introduce these gods; <line>for ten to one, in former days was odds. <line>so fraud was us'd, (the sacrificers' trade,) <line>fools are more hard to conquer than persuade. <line>their busy teachers mingled with the jews; <line>and rak'd, for converts, even the court and stews: <line>which hebrew priests the more unkindly took, <line>because the fleece accompanies the flock. <line>some thought they god's anointed meant to slay <line>by guns, invented since full many a day: <line>our author swears it not; but who can know <line>how far the devil and jebusites may go? <line>this plot, which fail'd for want of common sense, <line>had yet a deep and dangerous consequence: <line>for, as when raging fevers boil the blood, <line>the standing lake soon floats into a flood; <line>and ev'ry hostile humour, which before <line>slept quiet in its channels, bubbles o'er: <line>so, several factions from this first ferment, <line>work up to foam, and threat the government. <line>some by their friends, more by themselves thought wise, <line>oppos'd the pow'r, to which they could not rise. <line>some had in courts been great, and thrown from thence, <line>like fiends, were harden'd in impenitence. <line>some by their monarch's fatal mercy grown, <line>from pardon'd rebels, kinsmen to the throne; <line>were rais'd in pow'r and public office high; <line>strong bands, if bands ungrateful men could tie. <line> <line> of these the false achitophel was first: <line>a name to all succeeding ages curst. <line>for close designs, and crooked counsels fit; <line>sagacious, bold and turbulent of wit: <line>restless, unfixt in principles and place; <line>in pow'r unpleas'd, impatient of disgrace. <line>a fiery soul, which working out its way, <line>fretted the pigmy-body to decay: <line>and o'er inform'd the tenement of clay. <line>a daring pilot in extremity; <line>pleas'd with the danger, when the waves went high <line>he sought the storms; but for a calm unfit, <line>would steer too nigh the sands, to boast his wit. <line>great wits are sure to madness near alli'd; <line>and thin partitions do their bounds divide: <line>else, why should he, with wealth and honour blest, <line>refuse his age the needful hours of rest? <line>punish a body which he could not please; <line>bankrupt of life, yet prodigal of ease? <line>and all to leave, what with his toil he won <line>to that unfeather'd, two-legg'd thing, a son: <line>got, while his soul did huddled notions try; <line>and born a shapeless lump, like anarchy. <line>in friendship false, implacable in hate: <line>resolv'd to ruin or to rule the state. <line>to compass this, the triple bond he broke; <line>the pillars of the public safety shook: <line>and fitted israel for a foreign yoke. <line>then, seiz'd with fear, yet still affecting fame, <line>usurp'd a patriot's all-atoning name. <line>so easy still it proves in factious times, <line>with public zeal to cancel private crimes: <line>how safe is treason, and how sacred ill, <line>where none can sin against the people's will: <line>where crowds can wink; and no offence be known, <line>since in another's guilt they find their own. <line>yet, fame deserv'd, no enemy can grudge; <line>the statesman we abhor, but praise the judge. <line>in jewish courts ne'er sat an abbethdin <line>with more discerning eyes, or hands more clean: <line>unbrib'd, unsought, the wretched to redress; <line>swift of dispatch, and easy of access. <line>oh, had he been content to serve the crown, <line>with virtues only proper to the gown; <line>or, had the rankness of the soil been freed <line>from cockle, that opprest the noble seed: <line>david, for him his tuneful harp had strung, <line>and heav'n had wanted one immortal song. <line>but wild ambition loves to slide, not stand; <line>and fortune's ice prefers to virtue's land: <line>achitophel, grown weary to possess <line>a lawful fame, and lazy happiness; <line>disdain'd the golden fruit to gather free, <line>and lent the crowd his arm to shake the tree. <line>now, manifest of crimes, contriv'd long since, <line>he stood at bold defiance with his prince: <line>held up the buckler of the people's cause, <line>against the crown; and skulk'd behind the laws. <line>the wish'd occasion of the plot he takes; <line>some circumstances finds, but more he makes. <line>by buzzing emissaries, fills the ears <line>of list'ning crowds, with jealousies and fears <line>of arbitrary counsels brought to light, <line>and proves the king himself a jebusite. <line>weak arguments! which yet he knew full well, <line>were strong with people easy to rebel. <line>for, govern'd by the moon, the giddy jews <line>tread the same track when she the prime renews: <line>and once in twenty years, their scribes record, <line>by natural instinct they change their lord. <line>achitophel still wants a chief, and none <line>was found so fit as warlike absalom: <line>not, that he wish'd his greatness to create, <line>(for politicians neither love nor hate:) <line>but, for he knew, his title not allow'd, <line>would keep him still depending on the crowd: <line>that kingly pow'r, thus ebbing out, might be <line>drawn to the dregs of a democracy. <line>him he attempts, with studied arts to please, <line>and sheds his venom, in such words as these. <line> <line> auspicious prince! at whose nativity <line>some royal planet rul'd the southern sky; <line>thy longing country's darling and desire; <line>their cloudy pillar, and their guardian fire: <line>their second moses, whose extended wand <line>divides the seas, and shows the promis'd land: <line>whose dawning day, in very distant age, <line>has exercis'd the sacred prophet's rage: <line>the people's pray'r, the glad diviner's theme, <line>the young men's vision, and the old men's dream! <line>thee, saviour, thee, the nation's vows confess; <line>and, never satisfi'd with seeing, bless: <line>swift, unbespoken pomps, thy steps proclaim, <line>and stammering babes are taught to lisp thy name. <line>how long wilt thou the general joy detain; <line>starve, and defraud the people of thy reign? <line>content ingloriously to pass thy days <line>like one of virtue's fools that feeds on praise; <line>till thy fresh glories, which now shine so bright, <line>grow stale and tarnish with our daily sight. <line>believe me, royal youth, thy fruit must be, <line>or gather'd ripe, or rot upon the tree. <line>heav'n has to all allotted, soon or late, <line>some lucky revolution of their fate: <line>whose motions if we watch and guide with skill, <line>(for human good depends on human will,) <line>our fortune rolls, as from a smooth descent, <line>and, from the first impression, takes the bent: <line>but, if unseiz'd, she glides away like wind; <line>and leaves repenting folly far behind. <line>now, now she meets you, with a glorious prize, <line>and spreads her locks before her as she flies. <line>had thus old david, from whose loins you spring, <line>not dar'd, when fortune call'd him, to be king. <line>at gath an exile he might still remain; <line>and heaven's anointing oil had been in vain. <line>let his successful youth your hopes engage; <line>but shun th'example of declining age: <line>behold him setting in his western skies, <line>the shadows lengthening as the vapours rise. <line>he is not now, as when on jordan's sand <line>the joyful people throng'd to see him land, <line>cov'ring the beach, and black'ning all the strand: <line>but, like the prince of angels from his height, <line>comes tumbling downward with diminish'd light: <line>betray'd by one poor plot to public scorn: <line>(our only blessing since his curst return:) <line>those heaps of people which one sheaf did bind, <line>blown off, and scatter'd by a puff of wind. <line>what strength can he to your designs oppose, <line>naked of friends and round beset with foes? <line>if pharaoh's doubtful succour he should use, <line>a foreign aid would more incense the jews: <line>proud egypt would dissembled friendship bring; <line>foment the war, but not support the king: <line>nor would the royal party e'er unite <line>with pharaoh's arms, t'assist the jebusite; <line>or if they should, their interest soon would break, <line>and with such odious aid, make david weak. <line>all sorts of men, by my successful arts, <line>abhorring kings, estrange their alter'd hearts <line>from david's rule: and 'tis the general cry, <line>religion, common-wealth, and liberty. <line>if, you, as champion of the public good, <line>add to their arms a chief of royal blood; <line>what may not israel hope, and what applause <line>might such a general gain by such a cause? <line>not barren praise alone, that gaudy flow'r, <line>fair only to the sight, but solid pow'r: <line>and nobler is a limited command, <line>giv'n by the love of all your native land, <line>than a successive title, long, and dark, <line>drawn from the mouldy rolls of noah's ark. <line> <line> what cannot praise effect in mighty minds, <line>when flattery soothes, and when ambition blinds! <line>desire of pow'r, on earth a vicious weed, <line>yet, sprung from high, is of celestial seed: <line>in god 'tis glory: and when men aspire, <line>'tis but a spark too much of heavenly fire. <line>th' ambitious youth, too covetous of fame, <line>too full of angel's metal in his frame; <line>unwarily was led from virtue's ways; <line>made drunk with honour, and debauch'd with praise. <line>half loath, and half consenting to the ill, <line>(for loyal blood within him struggled still) <line>he thus repli'd.—and what pretence have i <line>to take up arms for public liberty? <line>my father governs with unquestion'd right; <line>the faith's defender, and mankind's delight: <line>good, gracious, just, observant of the laws; <line>and heav'n by wonders has espous'd his cause. <line>whom has he wrong'd in all his peaceful reign? <line>who sues for justice to his throne in vain? <line>what millions has he pardon'd of his foes, <line>whom just revenge did to his wrath expose? <line>mild, easy, humble, studious of our good; <line>inclin'd to mercy, and averse from blood. <line>if mildness ill with stubborn israel suit, <line>his crime is god's beloved attribute. <line>what could he gain, his people to betray, <line>or change his right, for arbitrary sway? <line>let haughty pharaoh curse with such a reign, <line>his fruitful nile, and yoke a servile train. <line>if david's rule jerusalem displease, <line>the dog-star heats their brains to this disease. <line>why then should i, encouraging the bad, <line>turn rebel, and run popularly mad? <line>were he a tyrant who, by lawless might, <line>oppress'd the jews, and rais'd the jebusite, <line>well might i mourn; but nature's holy bands <line>would curb my spirits, and restrain my hands: <line>the people might assert their liberty; <line>but what was right in them, were crime in me. <line>his favour leaves me nothing to require; <line>prevents my wishes, and out-runs desire. <line>what more can i expect while david lives? <line>all but his kingly diadem he gives: <line>and that: but there he paus'd; then sighing, said, <line>is justly destin'd for a worthier head. <line>for when my father from his toils shall rest, <line>and late augment the number of the blest: <line>his lawful issue shall the throne ascend; <line>or the collat'ral line where that shall end. <line>his brother, though oppress'd with vulgar spite, <line>yet dauntless and secure of native right, <line>of every royal virtue stands possess'd; <line>still dear to all the bravest, and the best. <line>his courage foes, his friends his truth proclaim; <line>his loyalty the king, the world his fame. <line>his mercy ev'n th'offending crowd will find: <line>for sure he comes of a forgiving kind. <line>why should i then repine at heaven's decree; <line>which gives me no pretence to royalty? <line>yet oh that fate, propitiously inclin'd, <line>had rais'd my birth, or had debas'd my mind; <line>to my large soul, not all her treasure lent, <line>and then betray'd it to a mean descent. <line>i find, i find my mounting spirits bold, <line>and david's part disdains my mother's mold. <line>why am i scanted by a niggard-birth? <line>my soul disclaims the kindred of her earth: <line>and made for empire, whispers me within; <line>desire of greatness is a god-like sin. <line> <line> him staggering so when hell's dire agent found, <line>while fainting virtue scarce maintain'd her ground, <line>he pours fresh forces in, and thus replies: <line> <line> th'eternal god, supremely good and wise, <line>imparts not these prodigious gifts in vain; <line>what wonders are reserv'd to bless your reign? <line>against your will your arguments have shown, <line>such virtue's only giv'n to guide a throne. <line>not that your father's mildness i contemn; <line>but manly force becomes the diadem. <line>'tis true, he grants the people all they crave; <line>and more perhaps than subjects ought to have: <line>for lavish grants suppose a monarch tame, <line>and more his goodness than his wit proclaim. <line>but when should people strive their bonds to break, <line>if not when kings are negligent or weak? <line>let him give on till he can give no more, <line>the thrifty sanhedrin shall keep him poor: <line>and every shekel which he can receive, <line>shall cost a limb of his prerogative. <line>to ply him with new plots, shall be my care; <line>or plunge him deep in some expensive war; <line>which, when his treasure can no more supply, <line>he must, with the remains of kingship, buy. <line>his faithful friends, our jealousies and fears <line>call jebusites; and pharaoh's pensioners: <line>whom, when our fury from his aid has torn, <line>he shall be naked left to public scorn. <line>the next successor, whom i fear and hate, <line>my arts have made obnoxious to the state; <line>turn'd all his virtues to his overthrow, <line>and gain'd our elders to pronounce a foe. <line>his right, for sums of necessary gold, <line>shall first be pawn'd, and afterwards be sold: <line>till time shall ever-wanting david draw, <line>to pass your doubtful title into law: <line>if not; the people have a right supreme <line>to make their kings; for kings are made for them. <line>all empire is no more than pow'r in trust: <line>which when resum'd, can be no longer just. <line>succession, for the general good design'd, <line>in its own wrong a nation cannot bind: <line>if altering that, the people can relieve, <line>better one suffer, than a nation grieve. <line>the jews well know their pow'r: ere saul they chose, <line>god was their king, and god they durst depose. <line>urge now your piety, your filial name, <line>a father's right, and fear of future fame; <line>the public good, the universal call, <line>to which even heav'n submitted, answers all. <line>nor let his love enchant your generous mind; <line>'tis nature's trick to propagate her kind. <line>our fond begetters, who would never die, <line>love but themselves in their posterity. <line>or let his kindness by th'effects be tri'd, <line>or let him lay his vain pretence aside. <line>god said he lov'd your father; could he bring <line>a better proof, than to anoint him king? <line>it surely show'd he lov'd the shepherd well, <line>who gave so fair a flock as israel. <line>would david have you thought his darling son? <line>what means he then, to alienate the crown? <line>the name of godly he may blush to bear: <line>'tis after god's own heart to cheat his heir. <line>he to his brother gives supreme command; <line>to you a legacy of barren land: <line>perhaps th'old harp, on which he thrums his lays: <line>or some dull hebrew ballad in your praise. <line>then the next heir, a prince, severe and wise <line>already looks on you with jealous eyes; <line>sees through the thin disguises of your arts, <line>and marks your progress in the people's hearts. <line>though now his mighty soul in grief contains, <line>he meditates revenge who least complains; <line>and like a lion, slumb'ring in the way, <line>or sleep-dissembling, while he waits his prey, <line>his fearless foes within his distance draws; <line>constrains his roaring and contracts his paws: <line>till at the last, his time for fury found, <line>he shoots with sudden vengeance from the ground: <line>the prostrate vulgar, passes o'er, and spares; <line>but with a lordly rage, his hunters tears. <line>your case no tame expedients will afford; <line>resolve on death, or conquest by the sword, <line>which for no less a stake than life, you draw; <line>and self-defence is nature's eldest law. <line>leave the warm people no considering time; <line>for then rebellion may be thought a crime. <line>prevail yourself of what occasion gives, <line>but try your title while your father lives: <line>and that your arms may have a fair pretence, <line>proclaim, you take them in the king's defence: <line>whose sacred life each minute would expose <line>to plots from seeming friends and secret foes. <line>and who can sound the depth of david's soul? <line>perhaps his fear, his kindness may control. <line>he fears his brother, though he loves his son, <line>for plighted vows too late to be undone. <line>if so, by force he wishes to be gain'd; <line>like women's lechery, to seem constrain'd: <line>doubt not; but when he most affects the frown, <line>commit a pleasing rape upon the crown. <line>secure his person to secure your cause; <line>they who possess the prince, possess the laws. <line> <line> he said, and this advice above the rest <line>with absalom's mild nature suited best; <line>unblam'd of life, (ambition set aside,) <line>not stain'd with cruelty, nor puff'd with pride. <line>how happy had he been, if destiny <line>had higher plac'd his birth, or not so high! <line>his kingly virtues might have claim'd a throne; <line>and blest all other countries but his own: <line>but charming greatness since so few refuse, <line>'tis juster to lament him, than accuse. <line>strong were his hopes a rival to remove, <line>with blandishments to gain the public love; <line>to head the faction while their zeal was hot, <line>and popularly prosecute the plot. <line>to farther this achitophel unites <line>the malcontents of all the israelites: <line>whose differing parties he could wisely join, <line>for several ends, to serve the same design. <line>the best, and of the princes some were such, <line>who thought the pow'r of monarchy too much: <line>mistaken men, and patriots in their hearts; <line>not wicked, but seduc'd by impious arts. <line>by these the springs of property were bent, <line>and wound so high, they crack'd the government. <line>the next for interest sought t'embroil the state, <line>to sell their duty at a dearer rate; <line>and make their jewish markets of the throne; <line>pretending public good, to serve their own. <line>others thought kings an useless heavy load, <line>who cost too much, and did too little good. <line>these were for laying honest david by, <line>on principles of pure good husbandry. <line>with them join'd all th'haranguers of the throng, <line>that thought to get preferment by the tongue. <line>who follow next, a double danger bring, <line>not only hating david, but the king; <line>the solymaean rout; well vers'd of old <line>in godly faction, and in treason bold; <line>cow'ring and quaking at a conqu'ror's sword, <line>but lofty to a lawful prince restor'd; <line>saw with disdain an ethnic plot begun, <line>and scorn'd by jebusites to be out-done. <line>hot levites headed these; who pull'd before <line>from th'ark, which in the judges' days they bore, <line>resum'd their cant, and with a zealous cry, <line>pursu'd their old belov'd theocracy. <line>where sanhedrin and priest enslav'd the nation, <line>and justifi'd their spoils by inspiration: <line>for who so fit for reign as aaron's race, <line>if once dominion they could found in grace? <line>these led the pack; though not of surest scent, <line>yet deepest mouth'd against the government. <line>a numerous host of dreaming saints succeed; <line>of the true old enthusiastic breed: <line>'gainst form and order they their pow'r employ; <line>nothing to build, and all things to destroy. <line>but far more numerous was the herd of such, <line>who think too little, and who talk too much. <line>these, out of mere instinct, they knew not why, <line>ador'd their father's god, and property: <line>and by the same blind benefit of fate, <line>the devil and the jebusite did hate: <line>born to be saved even in their own despite; <line>because they could not help believing right. <line>such were the tools; but a whole hydra more <line>remains, of sprouting heads too long, to score. <line>some of their chiefs were princes of the land: <line>in the first rank of these did zimri stand: <line>a man so various, that he seem'd to be <line>not one, but all mankind's epitome. <line>stiff in opinions, always in the wrong; <line>was everything by starts, and nothing long: <line>but in the course of one revolving moon, <line>was chemist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon: <line>then all for women, painting, rhyming, drinking; <line>besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking. <line>blest madman, who could every hour employ, <line>with something new to wish, or to enjoy! <line>railing and praising were his usual themes; <line>and both (to show his judgment) in extremes: <line>so over violent, or over civil, <line>that every man, with him, was god or devil. <line>in squandering wealth was his peculiar art: <line>nothing went unrewarded, but desert. <line>beggar'd by fools, whom still he found too late: <line>he had his jest, and they had his estate. <line>he laugh'd himself from court; then sought relief <line>by forming parties, but could ne'er be chief: <line>for, spite of him, the weight of business fell <line>on absalom and wise achitophel: <line>thus, wicked but in will, of means bereft, <line>he left not faction, but of that was left. <line> <line> titles and names 'twere tedious to rehearse <line>of lords, below the dignity of verse. <line>wits, warriors, commonwealths-men, were the best: <line>kind husbands and mere nobles all the rest. <line>and, therefore in the name of dullness, be <line>the well-hung balaam and cold caleb free. <line>and canting nadab let oblivion damn, <line>who made new porridge for the paschal lamb. <line>let friendship's holy band some names assure: <line>some their own worth, and some let scorn secure. <line>nor shall the rascal rabble here have place, <line>whom kings no titles gave, and god no grace: <line>not bull-faced jonas, who could statutes draw <line>to mean rebellion, and make treason law. <line>but he, though bad, is follow'd by a worse, <line>the wretch, who heav'n's anointed dar'd to curse. <line>shimei, whose youth did early promise bring <line>of zeal to god, and hatred to his king; <line>did wisely from expensive sins refrain, <line>and never broke the sabbath, but for gain: <line>nor ever was he known an oath to vent, <line>or curse, unless against the government. <line>thus, heaping wealth, by the most ready way <line>among the jews, which was to cheat and pray; <line>the city, to reward his pious hate <line>against his master, chose him magistrate: <line>his hand a vare of justice did uphold; <line>his neck was loaded with a chain of gold. <line>during his office, treason was no crime. <line>the sons of belial had a glorious time: <line>for shimei, though not prodigal of pelf, <line>yet lov'd his wicked neighbour as himself: <line>when two or three were gather'd to declaim <line>against the monarch of jerusalem, <line>shimei was always in the midst of them. <line>and, if they curst the king when he was by, <line>would rather curse, than break good company. <line>if any durst his factious friends accuse, <line>he pack'd a jury of dissenting jews: <line>whose fellow-feeling, in the godly cause, <line>would free the suff'ring saint from human laws. <line>for laws are only made to punish those <line>who serve the king, and to protect his foes. <line>if any leisure time he had from pow'r, <line>(because 'tis sin to mis-employ an hour;) <line>his bus'ness was, by writing, to persuade, <line>that kings were useless, and a clog to trade: <line>and, that his noble style he might refine, <line>no rechabite more shunn'd the fumes of wine. <line>chaste were his cellars; and his shrieval board <line>the grossness of a city feast abhorr'd: <line>his cooks, with long disuse, their trade forgot; <line>cool was his kitchen, though his brains were hot. <line>such frugal virtue malice may accuse; <line>but sure 'twas necessary to the jews: <line>for towns once burnt, such magistrates require <line>as dare not tempt god's providence by fire. <line>with spiritual food he fed his servants well, <line>but free from flesh, that made the jews rebel: <line>and moses' laws he held in more account <line>for forty days of fasting in the mount. <line>to speak the rest, who better are forgot, <line>would tire a well-breath'd witness of the plot: <line>yet, corah, thou shalt from oblivion pass; <line>erect thyself thou monumental brass: <line>high as the serpent of thy metal made, <line>while nations stand secure beneath thy shade. <line>what though his birth were base, yet comets rise <line>from earthy vapours e'er they shine in skies. <line>prodigious actions may as well be done <line>by weaver's issue, as by prince's son. <line>this arch-attestor, for the public good, <line>by that one deed ennobles all his blood. <line>who ever ask'd the witnesses' high race, <line>whose oath with martyrdom did stephen grace? <line>ours was a levite, and as times went then, <line>his tribe were god-almighty's gentlemen. <line>sunk were his eyes, his voice was harsh and loud, <line>sure signs he neither choleric was, nor proud: <line>his long chin prov'd his wit; his saint-like grace <line>a church vermilion, and a moses' face. <line>his memory, miraculously great, <line>could plots exceeding man's belief, repeat; <line>which therefore cannot be accounted lies, <line>for human wit could never such devise. <line>some future truths are mingled in his book; <line>but, where the witness fail'd, the prophet spoke: <line>some things like visionary flights appear; <line>the spirit caught him up, the lord knows where: <line>and gave him his rabbinical degree, <line>unknown to foreign university. <line>his judgment yet his mem'ry did excel: <line>which piec'd his wondrous evidence so well: <line>and suited to the temper of the times; <line>then groaning under jebusitic crimes. <line>let israel's foes suspect his heav'nly call, <line>and rashly judge his writ apocryphal; <line>our laws for such affronts have forfeits made: <line>he takes his life, who takes away his trade. <line>were i myself in witness corah's place, <line>the wretch who did me such a dire disgrace, <line>should whet my memory, though once forgot, <line>to make him an appendix of my plot. <line>his zeal to heav'n made him his prince despise, <line>and load his person with indignities: <line>but zeal peculiar privilege affords, <line>indulging latitude to deeds and words. <line>and corah might for agag's murther call, <line>in terms as coarse as samuel us'd to saul. <line>what others in his evidence did join, <line>(the best that could be had for love or coin,) <line>in corah's own predicament will fall: <line>for witness is a common name to all. <line> <line> surrounded thus with friends of every sort, <line>deluded absalom forsakes the court: <line>impatient of high hopes, urg'd with renown, <line>and fir'd with near possession of a crown: <line>th' admiring crowd are dazzled with surprise, <line>and on his goodly person feed their eyes: <line>his joy conceal'd, he sets himself to show; <line>on each side bowing popularly low: <line>his looks, his gestures, and his words he frames, <line>and with familiar ease repeats their names. <line>thus, form'd by nature, furnish'd out with arts, <line>he glides unfelt into their secret hearts: <line>then, with a kind compassionating look, <line>and sighs, bespeaking pity e'er he spoke: <line>few words he said; but easy those and fit: <line>more slow than hybla drops, and far more sweet. <line> <line> i mourn, my country-men, your lost estate; <line>though far unable to prevent your fate: <line>behold a banish'd man, for your dear cause <line>expos'd a prey to arbitrary laws! <line>yet oh! that i alone could be undone, <line>cut off from empire, and no more a son! <line>now all your liberties a spoil are made; <line>egypt and tyrus intercept your trade, <line>and jebusites your sacred rites invade. <line>my father, whom with reverence yet i name, <line>charm'd into ease, is careless of his fame: <line>and, brib'd with petty sums of foreign gold, <line>is grown in bathsheba's embraces old: <line>exalts his enemies, his friends destroys: <line>and all his pow'r against himself employs. <line>he gives, and let him give my right away: <line>but why should he his own, and yours betray? <line>he, only he can make the nation bleed, <line>and he alone from my revenge is freed. <line>take then my tears (with that he wip'd his eyes) <line>'tis all the aid my present pow'r supplies: <line>no court-informer can these arms accuse; <line>these arms may sons against their fathers use; <line>and, 'tis my wish, the next successor's reign <line>may make no other israelite complain. <line> <line> youth, beauty, graceful action, seldom fail: <line>but common interest always will prevail: <line>and pity never ceases to be shown <line>to him, who makes the people's wrongs his own. <line>the crowd, (that still believe their kings oppress,) <line>with lifted hands their young messiah bless: <line>who now begins his progress to ordain; <line>with chariots, horsemen, and a num'rous train: <line>from east to west his glories he displays: <line>and, like the sun, the promis'd land surveys. <line>fame runs before him, as the morning-star; <line>and shouts of joy salute him from afar: <line>each house receives him as a guardian god; <line>and consecrates the place of his abode: <line>but hospitable treats did most commend <line>wise issachar, his wealthy western friend. <line>this moving court, that caught the people's eyes, <line>and seem'd but pomp, did other ends disguise: <line>achitophel had form'd it, with intent <line>to sound the depths, and fathom where it went, <line>the people's hearts; distinguish friends from foes; <line>and try their strength, before they came to blows. <line>yet all was colour'd with a smooth pretence <line>of specious love, and duty to their prince. <line>religion, and redress of grievances, <line>two names, that always cheat and always please, <line>are often urg'd; and good king david's life <line>endanger'd by a brother and a wife. <line>thus, in a pageant show, a plot is made; <line>and peace itself is war in masquerade. <line>oh foolish israel! never warn'd by ill: <line>still the same bait, and circumvented still! <line>did ever men forsake their present ease, <line>in midst of health imagine a disease; <line>take pains contingent mischiefs to foresee, <line>make heirs for monarchs, and for god decree? <line>what shall we think! can people give away <line>both for themselves and sons, their native sway? <line>then they are left defenceless to the sword <line>of each unbounded arbitrary lord: <line>and laws are vain, by which we right enjoy, <line>if kings unquestion'd can those laws destroy. <line>yet, if the crowd be judge of fit and just, <line>and kings are only officers in trust, <line>then this resuming cov'nant was declar'd <line>when kings were made, or is for ever bar'd: <line>if those who gave the sceptre could not tie <line>by their own deed their own posterity, <line>how then could adam bind his future race? <line>how could his forfeit on mankind take place? <line>or how could heavenly justice damn us all, <line>who ne'er consented to our father's fall? <line>then kings are slaves to those whom they command, <line>and tenants to their people's pleasure stand. <line>add, that the pow'r for property allow'd, <line>is mischievously seated in the crowd: <line>for who can be secure of private right, <line>if sovereign sway may be dissolv'd by might? <line>nor is the people's judgment always true: <line>the most may err as grossly as the few. <line>and faultless kings run down, by common cry, <line>for vice, oppression and for tyranny. <line>what standard is there in a fickle rout, <line>which, flowing to the mark, runs faster out? <line>nor only crowds, but sanhedrins may be <line>infected with this public lunacy: <line>and share the madness of rebellious times, <line>to murther monarchs for imagin'd crimes. <line>if they may give and take whene'er they please, <line>not kings alone, (the godhead's images,) <line>but government itself at length must fall <line>to nature's state, where all have right to all. <line>yet, grant our lords the people kings can make, <line>what prudent men a settled throne would shake? <line>for whatsoe'er their sufferings were before, <line>that change they covet makes them suffer more. <line>all other errors but disturb a state; <line>but innovation is the blow of fate. <line>if ancient fabrics nod, and threat to fall, <line>to patch the flaws, and buttress up the wall, <line>thus far 'tis duty; but here fix the mark: <line>for all beyond it is to touch our ark. <line>to change foundations, cast the frame anew, <line>is work for rebels who base ends pursue: <line>at once divine and human laws control; <line>and mend the parts by ruin of the whole. <line>the tamp'ring world is subject to this curse, <line>to physic their disease into a worse. <line> <line> now what relief can righteous david bring? <line>how fatal 'tis to be too good a king! <line>friends he has few, so high the madness grows; <line>who dare be such, must be the people's foes: <line>yet some there were, ev'n in the worst of days; <line>some let me name, and naming is to praise. <line> <line> in this short file barzillai first appears; <line>barzillai crown'd with honour and with years: <line>long since, the rising rebels he withstood <line>in regions waste, beyond the jordan's flood: <line>unfortunately brave to buoy the state; <line>but sinking underneath his master's fate: <line>in exile with his god-like prince he mourn'd: <line>for him he suffer'd, and with him return'd. <line>the court he practis'd, not the courtier's art: <line>large was his wealth, but larger was his heart: <line>which well the noblest objects knew to choose, <line>the fighting warrior, and recording muse. <line>his bed could once a fruitful issue boast: <line>now more than half a father's name is lost. <line>his eldest hope, with every grace adorn'd, <line>by me (so heav'n will have it) always mourn'd, <line>and always honour'd, snatch'd in manhood's prime <line>b' unequal fates, and providence's crime: <line>yet not before the goal of honour won, <line>all parts fulfill'd, of subject and of son; <line>swift was the race, but short the time to run. <line>oh narrow circle, but of pow'r divine, <line>scanted in space, but perfect in thy line! <line>by sea, by land, thy matchless worth was known; <line>arms thy delight, and war was all thy own: <line>thy force infus'd, the fainting tyrians propp'd: <line>and haughty pharaoh found his fortune stopp'd. <line>oh ancient honour, oh unconquer'd hand, <line>whom foes unpunish'd never could withstand! <line>but israel was unworthy of thy name: <line>short is the date of all immoderate fame. <line>it looks as heav'n our ruin had design'd, <line>and durst not trust thy fortune and thy mind. <line>now, free from earth, thy disencumber'd soul <line>mounts up, and leaves behind the clouds and starry pole: <line>from thence thy kindred legions may'st thou bring, <line>to aid the guardian angel of thy king. <line>here stop my muse, here cease thy painful flight; <line>no pinions can pursue immortal height: <line>tell good barzillai thou canst sing no more, <line>and tell thy soul she should have fled before; <line>or fled she with his life, and left this verse <line>to hang on her departed patron's hearse? <line>now take thy steepy flight from heav'n, and see <line>if thou canst find on earth another he; <line>another he would be too hard to find, <line>see then whom thou canst see not far behind. <line>zadoc the priest whom, shunning, pow'r and place, <line>his lowly mind advanc'd to david's grace: <line>with him the sagan of jerusalem, <line>of hospitable soul and noble stem; <line>him of the western dome, whose weighty sense <line>flows in fit words and heavenly eloquence. <line>the prophet's sons by such example led, <line>to learning and to loyalty were bred: <line>for colleges on bounteous kings depend, <line>and never rebel was to arts a friend. <line>to these succeed the pillars of the laws, <line>who best could plead, and best can judge a cause. <line>next them a train of loyal peers ascend: <line>sharp judging adriel, the muse's friend, <line>himself a muse:—in sanhedrin's debate <line>true to his prince; but not a slave of state. <line>whom david's love with honours did adorn, <line>that from his disobedient son were torn. <line>jotham of piercing wit and pregnant thought, <line>endow'd by nature, and by learning taught <line>to move assemblies, who but only tri'd <line>the worse awhile, then chose the better side; <line>nor chose alone, but turn'd the balance too; <line>so much the weight of one brave man can do. <line>hushai, the friend of david in distress, <line>in public storms of manly steadfastness; <line>by foreign treaties he inform'd his youth; <line>and join'd experience to his native truth. <line>his frugal care suppli'd the wanting throne; <line>frugal for that, but bounteous of his own: <line>'tis easy conduct when exchequers flow; <line>but hard the task to manage well the low: <line>for sovereign power is too depress'd or high, <line>when kings are forc'd to sell, or crowds to buy. <line>indulge one labour more, my weary muse, <line>for amiel, who can amiel's praise refuse? <line>of ancient race by birth, but nobler yet <line>in his own worth, and without title great: <line>the sanhedrin long time as chief he rul'd, <line>their reason guided, and their passion cool'd; <line>so dext'rous was he in the crown's defence, <line>so form'd to speak a loyal nation's sense, <line>that as their band was israel's tribes in small, <line>so fit was he to represent them all. <line>now rasher charioteers the seat ascend, <line>whose loose careers his steady skill commend: <line>they, like th'unequal ruler of the day, <line>misguide the seasons and mistake the way; <line>while he withdrawn at their mad labour smiles, <line>and safe enjoys the sabbath of his toils. <line> <line> these were the chief; a small but faithful band <line>of worthies, in the breach who dar'd to stand, <line>and tempt th'united fury of the land. <line>with grief they view'd such powerful engines bent, <line>to batter down the lawful government. <line>a numerous faction with pretended frights, <line>in sanhedrins to plume the regal rights. <line>the true successor from the court remov'd: <line>the plot, by hireling witnesses, improv'd. <line>these ills they saw, and as their duty bound, <line>they show'd the king the danger of the wound: <line>that no concessions from the throne would please; <line>but lenitives fomented the disease: <line>that absalom, ambitious of the crown, <line>was made the lure to draw the people down: <line>that false achitophel's pernicious hate, <line>had turn'd the plot to ruin church and state: <line>the council violent, the rabble worse: <line>that shimei taught jerusalem to curse. <line> <line> with all these loads of injuries opprest, <line>and long revolving in his careful breast <line>th'event of things; at last his patience tir'd, <line>thus from his royal throne, by heav'n inspir'd, <line>the god-like david spoke; and awful fear <line>his train their maker in their master hear. <line> <line> thus long have i by native mercy sway'd, <line>my wrongs dissembl'd, my revenge delay'd: <line>so willing to forgive th'offending age; <line>so much the father did the king assuage. <line>but now so far my clemency they slight, <line>th' offenders question my forgiving right. <line>that one was made for many, they contend: <line>but 'tis to rule, for that's a monarch's end. <line>they call my tenderness of blood, my fear: <line>though manly tempers can the longest bear. <line>yet, since they will divert my native course, <line>'tis time to shew i am not good by force. <line>those heap'd affronts that haughty subjects bring, <line>are burdens for a camel, not a king: <line>kings are the public pillars of the state, <line>born to sustain and prop the nation's weight: <line>if my young sampson will pretend a call <line>to shake the column, let him share the fall: <line>but oh that yet he would repent and live! <line>how easy 'tis for parents to forgive! <line>with how few tears a pardon might be won <line>from nature, pleading for a darling son! <line>poor pitied youth, by my paternal care, <line>rais'd up to all the heights his frame could bear: <line>had god ordain'd his fate for empire born, <line>he would have giv'n his soul another turn: <line>gull'd with a patriot's name, whose modern sense <line>is one that would by law supplant his prince: <line>the people's brave, the politician's tool; <line>never was patriot yet, but was a fool. <line>whence comes it that religion and the laws <line>should more be absalom's than david's cause? <line>his old instructor, e'er he lost his place, <line>was never thought endued with so much grace. <line>good heav'ns, how faction can a patriot paint! <line>my rebel ever proves my people's saint; <line>would they impose an heir upon the throne? <line>let sanhedrins be taught to give their own. <line>a king's at least a part of government; <line>and mine as requisite as their consent: <line>without my leave a future king to choose, <line>infers a right the present to depose; <line>true, they petition me t'approve their choice: <line>but esau's hands suit ill with jacob's voice. <line>my pious subjects for my safety pray, <line>which to secure they take my pow'r away. <line>from plots and treasons heav'n preserve my years <line>but save me most from my petitioners. <line>unsatiate as the barren womb or grave; <line>god cannot grant so much as they can crave. <line>what then is left but with a jealous eye <line>to guard the small remains of royalty? <line>the law shall still direct my peaceful sway, <line>and the same law teach rebels to obey: <line>votes shall no more establish'd pow'r control, <line>such votes as make a part exceed the whole: <line>no groundless clamours shall my friends remove, <line>nor crowds have pow'r to punish ere they prove: <line>for gods, and god-like kings their care express, <line>still to defend their servants in distress. <line>oh that my pow'r to saving were confin'd: <line>why am i forc'd, like heav'n, against my mind, <line>to make examples of another kind? <line>must i at length the sword of justice draw? <line>oh curst effects of necessary law! <line>how ill my fear they by my mercy scan, <line>beware the fury of a patient man. <line>law they require, let law then show her face; <line>they could not be content to look on grace, <line>her hinder parts, but with a daring eye <line>to tempt the terror of her front, and die. <line>by their own arts 'tis righteously decreed, <line>those dire artificers of death shall bleed. <line>against themselves their witnesses will swear, <line>till viper-like their mother plot they tear: <line>and suck for nutriment that bloody gore <line>which was their principle of life before. <line>their belial with the belzebub will fight; <line>thus on my foes, my foes shall do me right: <line>nor doubt th'event: for factious crowds engage <line>in their first onset, all their brutal rage; <line>then, let 'em take an unresisted course: <line>retire and traverse, and delude their force: <line>but when they stand all breathless, urge the fight, <line>and rise upon 'em with redoubled might: <line>for lawful pow'r is still superior found, <line>when long driv'n back, at length it stands the ground. <line> <line> he said. th' almighty, nodding, gave consent; <line>and peals of thunder shook the firmament. <line>henceforth a series of new time began, <line>the mighty years in long procession ran: <line>once more the god-like david was restor'd, <line>and willing nations knew their lawful lord. <line> <line>","religion,judaism,arts & sciences,humor & satire,social commentaries,history & politics"

12176,302,"<line> <line> in the epilogue to the autobiography of malcolm x, alex haley recounts meeting a pensive malcolm at the kennedy airport, watching newly immigrated children “romping and playing” in their sudden home. “by tomorrow night,” malcolm says to alex, “they’ll know how to say their first english word—nigger.” <line> <line>before cable television arrived in india, america was a white nation. i imagined new england snows dusting california and miami’s beaches stretched across appalachia. america was a papier-mâché parody patched together by a cheaply hired prop maker. geographic accuracy was sacrificed to the interpersonal dramas of betty and veronica, and the american banquet was limited to the malted and fried offerings in pop’s chock’lit shoppe, where the riverdale gang solved the real geopolitical problems of how to get reggie off moose’s back with the help of archie’s fumbling charms. here, class warfare came with a side of fries. there were rumors of distant family members “settling” in “north dakota” or “oklahoma”—names that put themselves together like lego castles: hard-edged and jutting out with an abrupt l or a particularly pokey k. <line> <line>blackness was just a rumor too. blackness flickered in the background of photographs they sent back from these mysterious locations: here’s an uncle waving at us from a glittering times square (los angeles); here’s an aunt waving at us mid-way through the soft-focus neon breakfasts with aunt jemima’s maple syrup (made from maple leaves); here’s a nephew waving at us next to the poster of a red and white michael jordan in a quilted bedroom, his rotund brown body snuggled in tie-dye and tucked into tartan flannel sheets. blackness was a rumor, that is, until michael jackson’s bad ripped into our consciousness and suddenly, knobby-kneed pre-teens found a way to make stringy curls with coconut oil stolen from their mothers’ kitchens and started moonwalking backwards into my social studies classrooms, all snappy crotch and jaunty limbs. we girls rolled our eyes but we kept on watching. <line> <line>it wasn’t long before jackson’s unsparing gaze, draped in slick black leather, began replacing the glowing pastel ganeshes and saraswatis hanging above study desks. but replacing an elephantine god’s soft paunch with lean, mean celebrity did not save us from our own ignorance of how blackness and brownness were connected through a struggle for economic self-realization and human rights. while kids in chennai were rehearsing michael peters’ signature choreography for “thriller” and pretending to be zombies—little exemplary half-dead spectacles—union carbide was industriously shirking responsibility for the bhopal tragedy, which choked thousands of indians to death, and black mortality was spiking in violent, homicidal protest of the us dea’s drug buys and cocaine busts. <line> <line>in other words, tamilians blinked away michael jackson’s blackness. we kept the heat and thunder of his fat synth bass, which found its way into ilayaraaja’s electric disco in films of the late 1980s like vetri vizha and agni natchathiram. we kept the ebullient automation of his moves, which became a muscular theme in prabhu deva’s blend of baggy breakdance and whimsical terukoothu folk dancing in the 1990s. but we forgot his blackness. in time, the lightning of his presence was replaced by the grey hum of cnn, cops, law & order, and the dull horror of handcuffs on dark wrists. posters yellowed, cassettes spooled out, and my moonwalking classmates found their scientific calculators and study guides again. <line> <line>but the rumors of racial difference in george bush sr.’s america continued to bloom and wilt in morose cycles in my childhood homes into the 1990s. in damp clusters, it grew like moss under rocks. rootless, it stretched its stringy arms and held us by the ankles; it grew like mold between bathroom tiles; it spun itself fine and strong, webbing into corners where our brooms couldn’t reach. in time, the mossy rocks lined our after-dinner walks past the hibiscus bushes. in time, a grandmother slipped on the bathroom tiles and stayed in bed, fed conjee by a fatherless girl brought in from the village and the moss grew between her toes and drew her into the earth where they buried the nameless pets and tossed the chicken feathers. in time, the spiders hung so low they fell into pickle jars every time a child fished for a gooseberry or a slice of stony green mango from the brine. and from this brine, in time, we learned to believe that it existed. and as tamilian families began drifting from the flashy monsoons of india to the june gloom of the california bay or to the sharp wet summers of the keys, they carried the damp and stench in suitcases and buried it in hushed conversations. they made a poultice of moss and spider web and lodged it in the prayer books, hung it around the children’s necks like a talisman, and they said—as long as she doesn’t marry a black man. <line>","social commentaries,money & economics,race & ethnicity"

(o scholars) this is the ambivalence of classical blues—and the coins came from the blue-devils’ pocket of dipsy muse. across an alp of chitterlings, pungent as epigrams, doctor obi nkomo the alter ego of the harlem gallery —as a news-waif hallooed, “the desert fox is dead!”— clicked his tongue —a residual habit from the veld— and —stout as a peasant in the bread-and-cheese war— said, “the lie of the artist is the only lie for which a mortal or a god should die.” because nobody was a nobody to him, when from his thin charcoal lips irony escaped, it was malice toward none. the therapy of his slips by design into primitive objets d’art humanized the patrons of the harlem gallery as much as the masterworks he salvaged from the lethe of the american way in black manhattan. mr. guy delaporte iii cried out before the regents, “mr. curator, what manner of man is this?” unharassed by the ignis fatuus of a lost job, doctor nkomo clicked throatily and, with a chuckle whispered to me, “it’s not this buckle- head’s right or wrong if he does right or wrong.” like a humming disk came the strophe of a rebel bantu song. hubris is an evil the greeks (euripides, sophocles, aeschylus) boned and fleshed to wear the mask. pride is the lust- sinewed wench the churchman speaks of first in the table of deadly sins: doctor nkomo’s all hail to man was a vane on the wing to winnow the grain in person, place and thing. too many (perhaps) of the regents’ corralled hours doctor nkomo and i left gored in bull rings of pros and cons: without a horse-opera god, the ultra dons the matador’s black of the wherefore and the why, or hoists the white flag and lets the red cells in the marrow die. his idée fixe ebbed and flowed across the dinner table: “absurd life shakes its ass’s ears in cendrars’—not nkomo’s—stable. if, anchored like hooks of a hag-fish to sea weeds and patient as a weaver in haute-lisse tapestry, a rivera or a picasso, with a camel-hair alchemy, paints in fresco-buono the seven panels of a man’s tridimensionality in variforms and varicolors— since virtue has no kelvin scale, since a mother breeds no twins alike, since no man is an escape running wild from self-sown seeds— then, no man, judged by his biosocial identity in toto can be a kiefekil or a tartufe, an iscariot or an iago.” is philosophy, then, a tittle’s snack? history, a peacock's almanac? he laughed down at me, a kidney without anchorage, and said: “you must see through the millstone, since you’re not like julio sigafoos and me— an ex-savage.” his ebony forefinger an assagai blade, he mused aloud as the box played in harlem’s juke: “curator of the harlem ghetto, what is a masterpiece? a virgin or a jade, the vis viva of an ape of god, to awaken one, to pleasure one— a way-of-life’s aubade.” black as cypress lawn, the crag of a woman crabsidled in. the breath of a fraxinella in hot weather, her unlooked-for grin evaporated; then, like a well’s spew of mud and oil and raw gas, she blew her top. dipsy muse slumped like uhlan when his feet failed to prop, his squeal the squeal of a peccary ax-poled in its pen. the stem and stern of the elite chitterling shop pitched and ditched in the chatter and squawks, in the clatter and guffaws, as a yarmouth yawl yaws when struck by a rogue-elephant sea. scragged beyond the cavernous door, clamorous as a parrot against the rain, dipsy muse’s vanity scrabbled in vain like an anchor along the neck-gorge of a sea-floor. the jukebox railed and wailed: the black widow spider gets rid of her man, gets rid of her daddy as fast as she can. if you fool around, i know what i’ll do— like the black widow spider i’ll get rid of you. a giraffine fellow whose yellow skin mocked the netted pattern of a cantaloupe opened his rawhide pocketbook to sniff of dope a whiff, with a galley curse and an alley gag; then—laughing, choking, brimstoning his spouse, he caved in like ben franklin’s beggarly bag. doctor nkomo sighed: “the nicks and cuts under a stallion’s tail spur him to carry it higher; but the incised horsetail of a man drains the bones of his i-ness drier.” a black outsider with all his eggs but one in the white man’s basket, he quaffed his beer, stretched his beanpole legs; then —a rubberneck robin hood in a morris dance— readied a hobby with another color for a ride beyond the afrikaner’s stance. “o, romeo,” he said, “o casanova, prithee, what is chivalrous—what, barbaric? (why gnaw one’s thoughts to the bone?) when a cavemen painted a rubric figure of his mate with a gritstone, eros conquered thanatos.” his eyes glistening dots of an ice plant, he said: “my western friends —with deserts to be turned into green pastures— rent diving bells to get the bends, curfew morals, incubate tsetse flies, stage a barroom brawl of means and ends in a cul-de-sac. (eagles dying of hunger with cocks in their claws!) that rebel jukebox! hear the ghetto’s dark guffaws that defy manhattan’s bible belt! aeons separate my native veld and your peaks of philosophy: i made the trek, curator, on man’s vegetable ivory, in threescore years and ten.” a whale of a man, i thought, a true, but not a typical, mammal. he absorbs alien ideas as urdu arabic characters. in a sepulchral corner, i glimpsed a scarlet sister mary on the make, her lips dark and juicy like a half-done t-bone steak. the giraffine fellow eyed us with a dog-ape look and outed his impatience in a sigh; a single-acting plunger cast the die, “mister, who are you?” his catarrhal eye baited by doctor nkomo’s hair (the silvery gray patina of a japanese alloy), he was but a squeaking cleopatra boy when the reply came like the undershot of a poncelet water wheel: “obi nkomo, my dear watson; but that is nil, a water stair that meanders to no vessel. if you ask what am i, you dash on rocks the wisdom and the will of solon and solomon. am i a bee drugged on the honey of sophistry? am i a fish from a river jordan, fated to die as soon as it reaches an asphalt sea?” not a sound came from the yellow giraffine fellow— not a sound from the bowels of this ixion bound to the everlasting revolving ghetto wheel. nearer the ground than townsend’s solitaire, doctor nkomo raked his hair … his brain … but he did not blink the cliff of ice. “what am i? what are you? perhaps we are twin colors in a crystal. when i was a zulu lad, i heard an old-wives’ tale for seven-foot-spear chakas to be. in a barnyard near a buffalo trail a hunter discovered an eagle eating dung with chickens. he carried the feathered rex to a mountain top, although it raised the dickens. the hunter explained, ‘you're not a chicken, aquila.’ he launched the ungainly bird into space. a fouled umbrella! in the wing lock of habit, it tumbled in disgrace … down … down … down a ghostified cock! “out of the visaing face of the sun swooped the falcon baron clarioning the summons of an aeried race. twice the barnyard eagle answered the solar city wight; thrice he spiraled the simoom-blistered height— braked and banked and beaked upward, upward, into transfiguring light. old probabilities, what am i? mister, what are you? an eagle or a chicken come home to roost? i wish i knew!” his character (in the greek sense) phrased a nonplus—needed a metaphor’s translation. as an african prince, kings and chiefs peacocked themselves behind him; and he, himself tough-conscienced, had slain heathenism, the giant grim, without a backward cry. scot and plot, caste and class, rifted right angles to the curving grain. the dream of abraham’s bosom bottled long ago, he walked the pork barrel’s porphyry street with the man in the ears; and the glassy rivers of talk —heraclitean, fabian, marxian— in the lights and shadows of the illuminating gas, bona fides, limned a figure and cast of homo aethiopicus who knew all riverine traffickers pass beyond the seven walls of water—to join … the last of the greeks … of the romans, the last. once in a while his apology shaped itself like the symbol q in a skipper’s log. during the falconry in the chamber of the regents, mr. delaporte iii flew off at a tangent and off the handle. doctor nkomo’s dandie dinmount terrier epithet sprang across the tables. my gavel big-talked in slang. like a turtle’s head, the session withdrew into its shell. the old africanist bowed cavalierly and said: “i’ve called the gentleman a liar —it’s true— and i am sorry for it.” wealth of the fettered, illth of the lettered, left his realism, like rock dust, unweathered: one who eyes the needle of the present to knit the future’s garb. in his own buttoned guise he seemed to speak to the man friday in everyman boned and lined and veined for the twelve great fatigues to the promised land: “the golden mean of the dark wayfarer’s way between black scylla and white charybdis, i have traveled; subdued ifs in the way; from vile-canaille balconies and nigger heavens, seen day beasts and night beasts of prey in the disemboweling pits of europe and america, in the death-worming bowels of asia and africa; and, although a dumb ox (like young aquinas), i have not forgot the rainbows and the olive leaves against the orient sky. “the basso profundo gibbon of putney —not the lyric tenor, thomas of celano— hymns the dies irae!” <line>","living,life choices,the mind,relationships,family & ancestors,arts & sciences,music,philosophy,social commentaries,class,race & ethnicity"

for now satan, now first inflam'd with rage, came down, the tempter ere th' accuser of man-kind, to wreck on innocent frail man his loss of that first battel, and his flight to hell: yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold, far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast, begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest, and like a devillish engine back recoiles upon himself; horror and doubt distract his troubl'd thoughts, and from the bottom stirr the hell within him, for within him hell he brings, and round about him, nor from hell one step no more then from himself can fly by change of place: now conscience wakes despair that slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie of what he was, what is, and what must be worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue. sometimes towards eden which now in his view lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad, sometimes towards heav'n and the full-blazing sun, which now sat high in his meridian towre: then much revolving, thus in sighs began. o thou that with surpassing glory crownd, look'st from thy sole dominion like the god of this new world; at whose sight all the starrs hide thir diminisht heads; to thee i call, but with no friendly voice, and add thy name o sun, to tell thee how i hate thy beams that bring to my remembrance from what state i fell, how glorious once above thy spheare; till pride and worse ambition threw me down warring in heav'n against heav'ns matchless king: ah wherefore! he deservd no such return from me, whom he created what i was in that bright eminence, and with his good upbraided none; nor was his service hard. what could be less then to afford him praise, the easiest recompence, and pay him thanks, how due! yet all his good prov'd ill in me, and wrought but malice; lifted up so high i sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher would set me highest, and in a moment quit the debt immense of endless gratitude, so burthensome still paying, still to ow; forgetful what from him i still receivd, and understood not that a grateful mind by owing owes not, but still pays, at once indebted and dischargd; what burden then? o had his powerful destiny ordaind me some inferiour angel, i had stood then happie; no unbounded hope had rais'd ambition. yet why not? som other power as great might have aspir'd, and me though mean drawn to his part; but other powers as great fell not, but stand unshak'n, from within or from without, to all temptations arm'd. hadst thou the same free will and power to stand? thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse, but heav'ns free love dealt equally to all? be then his love accurst, since love or hate, to me alike, it deals eternal woe. nay curs'd be thou; since against his thy will chose freely what it now so justly rues. me miserable! which way shall i flie infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire? which way i flie is hell; my self am hell; and in the lowest deep a lower deep still threatning to devour me opens wide, to which the hell i suffer seems a heav'n. o then at last relent: is there no place left for repentance, none for pardon left? none left but by submission; and that word disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame among the spirits beneath, whom i seduc'd with other promises and other vaunts then to submit, boasting i could subdue th' omnipotent. ay me, they little know how dearly i abide that boast so vaine, under what torments inwardly i groane; while they adore me on the throne of hell, with diadem and scepter high advanc'd the lower still i fall, onely supream in miserie; such joy ambition findes. but say i could repent and could obtaine by act of grace my former state; how soon would higth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay what feign'd submission swore: ease would recant vows made in pain, as violent and void. for never can true reconcilement grow where wounds of deadly hate have peirc'd so deep: which would but lead me to a worse relapse and heavier fall: so should i purchase deare short intermission bought with double smart. this knows my punisher; therefore as farr from granting hee, as i from begging peace: all hope excluded thus, behold in stead of us out-cast, exil'd, his new delight, mankind created, and for him this world. so farwel hope, and with hope farwel fear, farwel remorse: all good to me is lost; evil be thou my good; by thee at least divided empire with heav'ns king i hold by thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne; as man ere long, and this new world shall know. thus while he spake, each passion dimm'd his face thrice chang'd with pale, ire, envie and despair, which marrd his borrow'd visage, and betraid him counterfet, if any eye beheld. for heav'nly mindes from such distempers foule are ever cleer. whereof hee soon aware, each perturbation smooth'd with outward calme, artificer of fraud; and was the first that practisd falshood under saintly shew, deep malice to conceale, couch't with revenge: yet not anough had practisd to deceive uriel once warnd; whose eye pursu'd him down the way he went, and on th' assyrian mount saw him disfigur'd, more then could befall spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce he markd and mad demeanour, then alone, as he suppos'd, all unobserv'd, unseen. so on he fares, and to the border comes, of eden, where delicious paradise, now nearer, crowns with her enclosure green, as with a rural mound the champain head of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides with thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde, access deni'd; and over head up grew insuperable highth of loftiest shade, cedar, and pine, and firr, and branching palm, a silvan scene, and as the ranks ascend shade above shade, a woodie theatre of stateliest view. yet higher then thir tops the verdurous wall of paradise up sprung: which to our general sire gave prospect large into his neather empire neighbouring round. and higher then that wall a circling row of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit, blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt: on which the sun more glad impress'd his beams then in fair evening cloud, or humid bow, when god hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd that lantskip: and of pure now purer aire meets his approach, and to the heart inspires vernal delight and joy, able to drive all sadness but despair: now gentle gales fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole those balmie spoiles. as when to them who saile beyond the cape of hope, and now are past mozambic, off at sea north-east windes blow sabean odours from the spicie shoare of arabie the blest, with such delay well pleas'd they slack thir course, and many a league chear'd with the grateful smell old ocean smiles. so entertaind those odorous sweets the fiend who came thir bane, though with them better pleas'd then asmodeus with the fishie fume, that drove him, though enamourd, from the spouse of tobits son, and with a vengeance sent from media post to aegypt, there fast bound. now to th' ascent of that steep savage hill satan had journied on, pensive and slow; but further way found none, so thick entwin'd, as one continu'd brake, the undergrowth of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext all path of man or beast that past that way: one gate there only was, and that look'd east on th' other side: which when th' arch-fellon saw due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt, at one slight bound high over leap'd all bound of hill or highest wall, and sheer within lights on his feet. as when a prowling wolfe, whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, watching where shepherds pen thir flocks at eeve in hurdl'd cotes amid the field secure, leaps o're the fence with ease into the fould:. or as a thief bent to unhoord the cash of some rich burgher, whose substantial dores, cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault, in at the window climbs, or o're the tiles; so clomb this first grand thief into gods fould: so since into his church lewd hirelings climbe. thence up he flew, and on the tree of life, the middle tree and highest there that grew, sat like a cormorant; yet not true life thereby regaind, but sat devising death to them who liv'd; nor on the vertue thought of that life-giving plant, but only us'd for prospect, what well us'd had bin the pledge of immortality. so little knows any, but god alone, to value right the good before him, but perverts best things to worst abuse, or to thir meanest use. beneath him with new wonder now he views to all delight of human sense expos'd in narrow room natures whole wealth, yea more, a heav'n on earth, for blissful paradise of god the garden was, by him in the east of eden planted; eden stretchd her line from auran eastward to the royal towrs of great seleucia, built by grecian kings, or where the sons of eden long before dwelt in telassar: in this pleasant soile his farr more pleasant garden god ordaind; out of the fertil ground he caus'd to grow all trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; and all amid them stood the tree of life, high eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit of vegetable gold; and next to life our death the tree of knowledge grew fast by, knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill. southward through eden went a river large, nor chang'd his course, but through the shaggie hill pass'd underneath ingulft, for god had thrown that mountain as his garden mould high rais'd upon the rapid current, which through veins of porous earth with kindly thirst up drawn, rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill waterd the garden; thence united fell down the steep glade, and met the neather flood, which from his darksom passage now appeers, and now divided into four main streams, runs divers, wandring many a famous realme and country whereof here needs no account, but rather to tell how, if art could tell, how from that saphire fount the crisped brooks, rowling on orient pearl and sands of gold, with mazie error under pendant shades ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed flours worthy of paradise which not nice art in beds and curious knots, but nature boon powrd forth profuse on hill and dale and plaine, both where the morning sun first warmly smote the open field, and where the unpierc't shade lmbround the noontide bowrs: thus was this place, a happy rural seat of various view; groves whose rich trees wept odorous gumms and balme, others whose fruit burnisht with golden rinde hung amiable, hesperian fables true, if true, here only, and of delicious taste: betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks grasing the tender herb, were interpos'd, or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap of som irriguous valley spred her store, flours of all hue, and without thorn the rose: another side, umbrageous grots and caves of coole recess, o're which the mantling vine layes forth her purple grape, and gently creeps luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall down the slope hills, disperst, or in a lake, that to the fringed bank with myrtle crownd, her chrystal mirror holds, unite thir streams. the birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires, breathing the smell of field and grove, attune the trembling leaves, while universal pan knit with the graces and the hours in dance led on th' eternal spring. not that faire field of enna, where proserpin gathering flours her self a fairer floure by gloomie dis was gatherd, which cost ceres all that pain to seek her through the world; nor that sweet grove of daphne by orontes, and th' inspir'd castalian spring, might with this paradise of eden strive; nor that nyseian ile girt with the river triton, where old cham, whom gentiles ammon call and lybian jove, hid amalthea and her florid son young bacchus from his stepdame rhea's eye; nor where abassin kings thir issue guard, mount amara, though this by som suppos'd true paradise under the ethiop line by nilus head, enclosd with shining rock, a whole days journy high, but wide remote from this assyrian garden, where the fiend saw undelighted all delight, all kind of living creatures new to sight and strange: two of far nobler shape erect and tall, godlike erect, with native honour clad in naked majestie seemd lords of all, and worthie seemd, for in thir looks divine the image of thir glorious maker shon, truth, wisdome, sanctitude severe and pure, severe but in true filial freedom plac't; whence true autoritie in men; though both not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd; for contemplation hee and valour formd, for softness shee and sweet attractive grace, hee for god only, shee for god in him: his fair large front and eye sublime declar'd absolute rule; and hyacinthin locks round from his parted forelock manly hung clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad: shee as a vail down to the slender waste her unadorned golden tresses wore dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav'd as the vine curles her tendrils, which impli'd subjection, but requir'd with gentle sway, and by her yielded, by him best receivd, yielded with coy submission, modest pride, and sweet reluctant amorous delay. nor those mysterious parts were then conceald, then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame of natures works, honor dishonorable, sin-bred, how have ye troubl'd all mankind with shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure, and banisht from mans life his happiest life, simplicitie and spotless innocence. so passd they naked on, nor shund the sight of god or angel, for they thought no ill: so hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair that ever since in loves imbraces met, adam the goodliest man of men since borne his sons, the fairest of her daughters eve. under a tuft of shade that on a green stood whispering soft, by a fresh fountain side they sat them down, and after no more toil of thir sweet gardning labour then suffic'd to recommend coole zephyr, and made ease more easie, wholsom thirst and appetite more grateful, to thir supper fruits they fell, nectarine fruits which the compliant boughes yielded them, side-long as they sat recline on the soft downie bank damaskt with flours: the savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream; nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial league, alone as they. about them frisking playd all beasts of th' earth, since wilde, and of all chase in wood or wilderness, forrest or den;

close the serpent sly insinuating, wove with gordian twine his breaded train, and of his fatal guile gave proof unheeded; others on the grass coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat, or bedward ruminating: for the sun declin'd was hasting now with prone carreer to th' ocean iles, and in th' ascending scale of heav'n the starrs that usher evening rose: when satan still in gaze, as first he stood, scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad. o hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold, into our room of bliss thus high advanc't creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps, not spirits, yet to heav'nly spirits bright little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue with wonder, and could love, so lively shines in them divine resemblance, and such grace the hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd. ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh your change approaches, when all these delights will vanish and deliver ye to woe, more woe, the more your taste is now of joy; happie, but for so happie ill secur'd long to continue, and this high seat your heav'n ill fenc't for heav'n to keep out such a foe as now is enterd; yet no purpos'd foe to you whom i could pittie thus forlorne though i unpittied: league with you i seek, and mutual amitie so streight, so close, that i with you must dwell, or you with me henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please like this fair paradise, your sense, yet such accept your makers work; he gave it me, which i as freely give; hell shall unfold, to entertain you two, her widest gates, and send forth all her kings; there will be room, not like these narrow limits, to receive ass your numerous ofspring; if no better place, thank him who puts me loath to this revenge on you who wrong me not for him who wrongd. and should i at your harmless innocence melt, as i doe, yet public reason just, honour and empire with revenge enlarg'd, by conquering this new world, compels me now to do what else though damnd i should abhorre. so spake the fiend, and with necessitie, the tyrants plea, excus'd his devilish deeds. then from his loftie stand on that high tree down he alights among the sportful herd of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one, now other, as thir shape servd best his end neerer to view his prey, and unespi'd to mark what of thir state he more might learn by word or action markt: about them round a lion now he stalkes with fierie glare, then as a tyger, who by chance hath spi'd in some purlieu two gentle fawnes at play, strait couches close, then rising changes oft his couchant watch, as one who chose his ground whence rushing he might surest seize them both grip't in each paw: when adam first of men to first of women eve thus moving speech, turnd him all eare to hear new utterance flow. sole partner and sole part of all these joyes, dearer thy self then all; needs must the power that made us, and for us this ample world be infinitly good, and of his good as liberal and free as infinite, that rais'd us from the dust and plac't us here in all this happiness, who at his hand have nothing merited, nor can performe aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires from us no other service then to keep this one, this easie charge, of all the trees in paradise that bear delicious fruit so various, not to taste that onely tree of knowledge, planted by the tree of life, so neer grows death to life, what ere death is, som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst god hath pronounc't it death to taste that tree, the only sign of our obedience left among so many signes of power and rule conferrd upon us, and dominion giv'n over all other creatures that possess earth, aire, and sea. then let us not think hard one easie prohibition, who enjoy free leave so large to all things else, and choice unlimited of manifold delights: but let us ever praise him, and extoll his bountie, following our delightful task to prune these growing plants, and tend these flours, which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet. to whom thus eve repli'd. o thou for whom and from whom i was formd flesh of thy flesh, and without whom am to no end, my guide and head, what thou hast said is just and right. for wee to him indeed all praises owe, and daily thanks, i chiefly who enjoy so farr the happier lot, enjoying thee praeeminent by so much odds, while thou like consort to thy self canst no where find. that day i oft remember, when from sleep i first awak't, and found my self repos'd under a shade of flours, much wondring where and what i was, whence thither brought, and how. not distant far from thence a murmuring sound of waters issu'd from a cave and spread into a liquid plain, then stood unmov'd pure as th' expanse of heav'n; i thither went with unexperienc't thought, and laid me downe on the green bank, to look into the cleer smooth lake, that to me seemd another skie. as i bent down to look, just opposite, a shape within the watry gleam appeerd bending to look on me, i started back, it started back, but pleas'd i soon returnd, pleas'd it returnd as soon with answering looks of sympathie and love; there i had fixt mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire, had not a voice thus warnd me, what thou seest, what there thou seest fair creature is thy self, with thee it came and goes: but follow me, and i will bring thee where no shadow staies thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare multitudes like thy self, and thence be call'd mother of human race: what could i doe, but follow strait, invisibly thus led? till i espi'd thee, fair indeed and tall, under a platan, yet methought less faire, less winning soft, less amiablie milde, then that smooth watry image; back i turnd, thou following cryd'st aloud, return faire eve, whom fli'st thou? whom thou fli'st, of him thou art, his flesh, his bone; to give thee being i lent out of my side to thee, neerest my heart substantial life, to have thee by my side henceforth an individual solace dear; part of my soul i seek thee, and thee claim my other half: with that thy gentle hand seisd mine, i yielded, and from that time see how beauty is excelld by manly grace and wisdom, which alone is truly fair. so spake our general mother, and with eyes of conjugal attraction unreprov'd, and meek surrender, half imbracing leand on our first father, half her swelling breast naked met his under the flowing gold of her loose tresses hid: he in delight both of her beauty and submissive charms smil'd with superior love, as jupiter on juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds that shed may flowers; and press'd her matron lip with kisses pure: aside the devil turnd for envie, yet with jealous leer maligne ey'd them askance, and to himself thus plaind. sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two imparadis't in one anothers arms the happier eden, shall enjoy thir fill of bliss on bliss, while i to hell am thrust, where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire, among our other torments not the least, still unfulfill'd with pain of longing pines; yet let me not forget what i have gain'd from thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems: one fatal tree there stands of knowledge call'd, forbidden them to taste: knowledge forbidd'n? suspicious, reasonless. why should thir lord envie them that? can it be sin to know, can it be death? and do they onely stand by ignorance, is that thir happie state, the proof of thir obedience and thir faith? o fair foundation laid whereon to build thir ruine! hence i will excite thir minds with more desire to know, and to reject envious commands, invented with designe to keep them low whom knowledge might exalt equal with gods; aspiring to be such, they taste and die: what likelier can ensue? but first with narrow search i must walk round this garden, and no corner leave unspi'd; a chance but chance may lead where i may meet some wandring spirit of heav'n, by fountain side, or in thick shade retir'd, from him to draw what further would be learnt. live while ye may, yet happie pair; enjoy, till i return, short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed. so saying, his proud step he scornful turn'd, but with sly circumspection, and began through wood, through waste, o're hill, o're dale his roam. mean while in utmost longitude, where heav'n with earth and ocean meets, the setting sun slowly descended, and with right aspect against the eastern gate of paradise leveld his eevning rayes: it was a rock of alablaster, pil'd up to the clouds, conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent accessible from earth, one entrance high; the rest was craggie cliff, that overhung still as it rose, impossible to climbe. betwixt these rockie pillars gabriel sat chief of th' angelic guards, awaiting night; about him exercis'd heroic games th' unarmed youth of heav'n, but nigh at hand celestial armourie, shields, helmes, and speares, hung high with diamond flaming, and with gold. thither came uriel, gliding through the eeven on a sun beam, swift as a shooting starr in autumn thwarts the night, when vapors fir'd impress the air, and shews the mariner from what point of his compass to beware impetuous winds: he thus began in haste. gabriel, to thee thy course by lot hath giv'n charge and strict watch that to this happie place no evil thing approach or enter in; this day at highth of noon came to my spheare a spirit, zealous, as he seem'd, to know more of th' almighties works, and chiefly man gods latest image: i describ'd his way bent all on speed, and markt his aerie gate; but in the mount that lies from eden north, where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks alien from heav'n, with passions foul obscur'd: mine eye pursu'd him still, but under shade lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew i fear, hath ventur'd from the deep, to raise new troubles; him thy care must be to find. to whom the winged warriour thus returnd: uriel, no wonder if thy perfet sight, amid the suns bright circle where thou sitst, see farr and wide: in at this gate none pass the vigilance here plac't, but such as come well known from heav'n; and since meridian hour no creature thence: if spirit of other sort, so minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds on purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude spiritual substance with corporeal barr. but if within the circuit of these walks, in whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom thou tellst, by morrow dawning i shall know. so promis'd hee, and uriel to his charge returnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd bore him slope downward to the sun now fall'n beneath th' azores; whither the prime orb, incredible how swift, had thither rowl'd diurnal, or this less volubil earth by shorter flight to th' east, had left him there arraying with reflected purple and gold the clouds that on his western throne attend: now came still eevning on, and twilight gray had in her sober liverie all things clad; silence accompanied, for beast and bird, they to thir grassie couch, these to thir nests were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale; she all night long her amorous descant sung; silence was pleas'd: now glow'd the firmament with living saphirs: hesperus that led the starrie host, rode brightest, till the moon rising in clouded majestie, at length apparent queen unvaild her peerless light, and o're the dark her silver mantle threw. when adam thus to eve: fair consort, th' hour of night, and all things now retir'd to rest mind us of like repose, since god hath set labour and rest, as day and night to men successive, and the timely dew of sleep now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines our eye-lids; other creatures all day long rove idle unimploid, and less need rest; man hath his daily work of body or mind appointed, which declares his dignitie, and the regard of heav'n on all his waies; while other animals unactive range, and of thir doings god takes no account. to morrow ere fresh morning streak the east with first approach of light, we must be ris'n, and at our pleasant labour, to reform yon flourie arbors, yonder allies green, our walk at noon, with branches overgrown, that mock our scant manuring, and require more hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth: those blossoms also, and those dropping gumms, that lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth, ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease; mean while, as nature wills, night bids us rest. to whom thus eve with perfet beauty adornd. my author and disposer, what thou bidst unargu'd i obey; so god ordains, god is thy law, thou mine: to know no more is womans happiest knowledge and her praise. with thee conversing i forget all time, all seasons and thir change, all please alike. sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet, with charm of earliest birds; pleasant the sun when first on this delightful land he spreads his orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour, glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth after soft showers; and sweet the coming on of grateful eevning milde, then silent night with this her solemn bird and this fair moon, and these the gemms of heav'n, her starrie train: but neither breath of morn when she ascends with charm of earliest birds, nor rising sun on this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure, glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers, nor grateful eevning mild, nor silent night with this her solemn bird, nor walk by moon, or glittering starr-light without thee is sweet. but wherfore all night long shine these, for whom this glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes? to whom our general ancestor repli'd. daughter of god and man, accomplisht eve, those have thir course to finish, round the earth, by morrow eevning, and from land to land in order, though to nations yet unborn, ministring light prepar'd, they set and rise; least total darkness should by night regaine her old possession, and extinguish life in nature and all things, which these soft fires not only enlighten, but with kindly heate of various influence foment and warme, temper or nourish, or in part shed down thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow on earth, made hereby apter to receive perfection from the suns more potent ray. these then, though unbeheld in deep of night, shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none, that heav'n would want spectators, god want praise; millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:. all these with ceasless praise his works behold both day and night: how often from the steep of echoing hill or thicket have we heard celestial voices to the midnight air, sole, or responsive each to others note singing thir great creator: oft in bands while they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk with heav'nly touch of instrumental sounds in full harmonic number joind, thir songs divide the night, and lift our thoughts to heaven. thus talking hand in hand alone they pass'd on to thir blissful bower; it was a place chos'n by the sovran planter, when he fram'd all things to mans delightful use; the roofe of thickest covert was inwoven shade laurel and mirtle, and what higher grew of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side acanthus, and each odorous bushie shrub fenc'd up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour, iris all hues, roses, and gessamin rear'd high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought mosaic; underfoot the violet, crocus, and hyacinth with rich inlay broiderd the ground, more colour'd then with stone of costliest emblem: other creature here beast, bird, insect, or worm durst enter none; such was thir awe of man. in shadie bower more sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd, pan or silvanus never slept, nor nymph, nor faunus haunted. here in close recess with flowers, garlands, and sweet-smelling herbs espoused eve deckt first her nuptial bed, and heav'nly quires the hymenaean sung, what day the genial angel to our sire brought her in naked beauty more adorn'd, more lovely then pandora, whom the gods endowd with all thir gifts, and o too like in sad event, when to the unwiser son of japhet brought by hermes, she ensnar'd mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng'd on him who had stole joves authentic fire. thus at thir shadie lodge arriv'd, both stood both turnd, and under op'n skie ador'd the god that made both skie, air, earth and heav'n which they beheld, the moons resplendent globe and starrie pole: thou also mad'st the night, maker omnipotent, and thou the day, which we in our appointed work imployd have finisht happie in our mutual help and mutual love, the crown of all our bliss ordaind by thee, and this delicious place for us too large, where thy abundance wants partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground. but thou hast promis'd from us two a race to fill the earth, who shall with us extoll thy goodness infinite, both when we wake, and when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep. this said unanimous, and other rites observing none, but adoration pure which god likes best, into thir inmost bowre handed they went; and eas'd the putting off these troublesom disguises which wee wear, strait side by side were laid, nor turnd i weene adam from his fair spouse, nor eve the rites mysterious of connubial love refus'd: whatever hypocrites austerely talk of puritie and place and innocence, defaming as impure what god declares pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all. our maker bids increase, who bids abstain but our destroyer, foe to god and man? haile wedded love, mysterious law, true source of human ofspring, sole proprietie, in paradise of all things common else. by thee adulterous lust was driv'n from men among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee founded in reason, loyal, just, and pure, relations dear, and all the charities of father, son, and brother first were known. farr be it, that i should write thee sin or blame, or think thee unbefitting holiest place, perpetual fountain of domestic sweets, whose bed is undefil'd and chaste pronounc't, present, or past, as saints and patriarchs us'd. here love his golden shafts imploies, here lights his constant lamp, and waves his purple wings, reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile of harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard, casual fruition, nor in court amours mixt dance, or wanton mask, or midnight bal, or serenate, which the starv'd lover sings to his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. these lulld by nightingales imbraceing slept, and on thir naked limbs the flourie roof showrd roses, which the morn repair'd. sleep on blest pair; and o yet happiest if ye seek no happier state, and know to know no more. now had night measur'd with her shaddowie cone half way up hill this vast sublunar vault, and from thir ivorie port the cherubim forth issuing at th' accustomd hour stood armd to thir night watches in warlike parade, when gabriel to his next in power thus spake. uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the south with strictest watch; these other wheel the north, our circuit meets full west. as flame they part half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear. from these, two strong and suttle spirits he calld that neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge. ithuriel and zephon, with wingd speed search through this garden, leave unsearcht no nook, but chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge, now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme. this eevning from the sun's decline arriv'd who tells of som infernal spirit seen hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap'd the barrs of hell, on errand bad no doubt: such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. so saying, on he led his radiant files, daz'ling the moon; these to the bower direct in search of whom they sought: him there they found squat like a toad, close at the eare of eve; assaying by his devilish art to reach the organs of her fancie, and with them forge illusions as he list, phantasms and dreams, or if, inspiring venom, he might taint th' animal spirits that from pure blood arise like gentle breaths from rivers pure, thence raise at least distemperd, discontented thoughts, vaine hopes, vaine aimes, inordinate desires blown up with high conceits ingendring pride. him thus intent ithuriel with his spear touch'd lightly; for no falshood can endure touch of celestial temper, but returns of force to its own likeness: up he starts discoverd and surpriz'd. as when a spark lights on a heap of nitrous powder, laid fit for the tun som magazin to store against a rumord warr, the smuttie graine with sudden blaze diffus'd, inflames the aire: so started up in his own shape the fiend. back stept those two faire angels half amaz'd so sudden to behold the grieslie king; yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon. which of those rebell spirits adjudg'd to hell com'st thou, escap'd thy prison, and transform'd, why satst thou like an enemie in waite here watching at the head of these that sleep? know ye not then said satan, fill'd with scorn, know ye not mee? ye knew me once no mate for you, there sitting where ye durst not soare; not to know mee argues your selves unknown, the lowest of your throng; or if ye know, why ask ye, and superfluous begin your message, like to end as much in vain? to whom thus zephon, answering scorn with scorn. think not, revolted spirit, thy shape the same, or undiminisht brightness, to be known as when thou stoodst in heav'n upright and pure; that glorie then, when thou no more wast good, departed from thee, and thou resembl'st now thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule. but come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account to him who sent us, whose charge is to keep this place inviolable, and these from harm. so spake the cherube, and his grave rebuke severe in youthful beautie, added grace invincible: abasht the devil stood, and felt how awful goodness is, and saw vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin'd his loss; but chiefly to find here observd his lustre visibly impar'd; yet seemd undaunted. if i must contend, said he, best with the best, the sender not the sent, or all at once; more glorie will be wonn, or less be lost. thy fear, said zephon bold, will save us trial what the least can doe single against thee wicked, and thence weak. the fiend repli'd not, overcome with rage; but like a proud steed reind, went hautie on, chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie he held it vain; awe from above had quelld his heart, not else dismai'd. now drew they nigh the western point, where those half-rounding guard just met, and closing stood in squadron joind awaiting next command. to whom thir chief gabriel from the front thus calld aloud. o friends, i hear the tread of nimble feet hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne ithuriel and zephon through the shade, and with them comes a third of regal port, but faded splendor wan; who by his gate and fierce demeanour seems the prince of hell, not likely to part hence without contest; stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. he scarce had ended, when those two approachd and brief related whom they brought, where found, how busied, in what form and posture coucht. to whom with stern regard thus gabriel spake. why hast thou, satan broke the bounds prescrib'd to thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge of others, who approve not to transgress by thy example, but have power and right to question thy bold entrance on this place; imploi'd it seems to violate sleep, and those whose dwelling god hath planted here in bliss? to whom thus satan, with contemptuous brow. gabriel, thou hadst in heav'n th' esteem of wise, and such i held thee; but this question askt puts me in doubt. lives ther who loves his pain? who would not, finding way, break loose from hell, though thither doomd? thou wouldst thy self, no doubt, and boldly venture to whatever place farthest from pain, where thou mightest hope to change torment with ease, and soonest recompence dole with delight, which in this place i sought; to thee no reason; who knowst only good, but evil hast not tri'd: and wilt object his will who bound us? let him surer barr his iron gates, if he intends our stay in that dark durance: thus much what was askt. the rest is true, they found me where they say; but that implies not violence or harme. thus he in scorn.the warlike angel mov'd, disdainfully half smiling thus repli'd. o loss of one in heav'n to judge of wise, since satan fell, whom follie overthrew, and now returns him from his prison scap't, gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither unlicenc't from his bounds in hell prescrib'd; so wise he judges it to fly from pain however, and to scape his punishment. so judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth, which thou incurr'st by flying, meet thy flight seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to hell, which taught thee yet no better, that no pain can equal anger infinite provok't. but wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee came not all hell broke loose? is pain to them less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they less hardie to endure? courageous chief, the first in flight from pain, had'st thou alledg'd to thy deserted host this cause of flight, thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. to which the fiend thus answerd frowning stern. not that i less endure, or shrink from pain, insulting angel, well thou knowst i stood thy fiercest, when in battel to thy aide thy blasting volied thunder made all speed and seconded thy else not dreaded spear. but still thy words at random, as before, argue thy inexperience what behooves from hard assaies and ill successes past a faithful leader, not to hazard all through wayes of danger by himself untri'd. i therefore, i alone first undertook to wing the desolate abyss, and spie this new created world, whereof in hell fame is not silent, here in hope to find better abode, and my afflicted powers to settle here on earth, or in mid aire; though for possession put to try once more what thou and thy gay legions dare against; whose easier business were to serve thir lord high up in heav'n, with songs to hymne his throne, and practis'd distances to cringe, not fight. to whom the warriour angel, soon repli'd. to say and strait unsay, pretending first wise to flie pain, professing next the spie, argues no leader but a lyar trac't, satan, and couldst thou faithful add? o name, o sacred name of faithfulness profan'd! faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? armie of fiends, fit body to fit head; was this your discipline and faith ingag'd, your military obedience, to dissolve allegeance to th' acknowldg'd power supream? and thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem patron of liberty, who more then thou once fawn'd, and cring'd, and servilly ador'd heav'ns awful monarch? wherefore but in hope to dispossess him, and thy self to reigne? but mark what i arreede thee now, avant; flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre within these hallowd limits thou appeer, back to th' infernal pit i drag thee chaind, and seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne the facil gates of hell too slightly barrd. so threatn'd hee, but satan to no threats gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli'd. then when i am thy captive talk of chaines, proud limitarie cherube, but ere then farr heavier load thy self expect to feel from my prevailing arme, though heavens king ride on thy wings, and thou with thy compeers, us'd to the yoak, draw'st his triumphant wheels in progress through the rode of heav'n star-pav'd. while thus he spake, th' angelic squadron bright turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes thir phalanx, and began to hemm him round with ported spears, as thick as when a field of ceres ripe for harvest waving bends her bearded grove of ears, which way the wind swayes them; the careful plowman doubting stands least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves prove chaff. on th' other side satan allarm'd collecting all his might dilated stood, like teneriff or atlas unremov'd: his stature reacht the skie, and on his crest sat horror plum'd; nor wanted in his graspe what seemd both spear and shield: now dreadful deeds might have ensu'd, nor onely paradise in this commotion, but the starrie cope of heav'n perhaps, or all the elements at least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne with violence of this conflict, had not soon th' eternal to prevent such horrid fray hung forth in heav'n his golden scales, yet seen betwixt astrea and the scorpion signe, wherein all things created first he weighd, the pendulous round earth with ballanc't aire in counterpoise, now ponders all events, battels and realms: in these he put two weights the sequel each of parting and of fight; the latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam; which gabriel spying, thus bespake the fiend. satan, i know thy strength, and thou knowst mine, neither our own but giv'n; what follie then to boast what arms can doe, since thine no more then heav'n permits, nor mine, though doubld now to trample thee as mire: for proof look up, and read thy lot in yon celestial sign where thou art weigh'd, and shown how light, how weak, if thou resist. the fiend lookt up and knew his mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night. <line>","religion,christianity,god & the divine"

""thus,"" said he, ""will we build this ship! lay square the blocks upon the slip, and follow well this plan of mine. choose the timbers with greatest care; of all that is unsound beware; for only what is sound and strong to this vessel shall belong. cedar of maine and georgia pine here together shall combine. a goodly frame, and a goodly fame, and the union be her name! for the day that gives her to the sea shall give my daughter unto thee!"" the master's word enraptured the young man heard; and as he turned his face aside, with a look of joy and a thrill of pride standing before her father's door, he saw the form of his promised bride. the sun shone on her golden hair, and her cheek was glowing fresh and fair, with the breath of morn and the soft sea air. like a beauteous barge was she, still at rest on the sandy beach, just beyond the billow's reach; but he was the restless, seething, stormy sea! ah, how skilful grows the hand that obeyeth love's command! it is the heart, and not the brain, that to the highest doth attain, and he who followeth love's behest far excelleth all the rest! thus with the rising of the sun was the noble task begun, and soon throughout the ship-yard's bounds were heard the intermingled sounds of axes and of mallets, plied with vigorous arms on every side; plied so deftly and so well, that, ere the shadows of evening fell, the keel of oak for a noble ship, scarfed and bolted, straight and strong, was lying ready, and stretched along the blocks, well placed upon the slip. happy, thrice happy, every one who sees his labor well begun, and not perplexed and multiplied, by idly waiting for time and tide! and when the hot, long day was o'er, the young man at the master's door sat with the maiden calm and still, and within the porch, a little more removed beyond the evening chill, the father sat, and told them tales of wrecks in the great september gales, of pirates coasting the spanish main, and ships that never came back again, the chance and change of a sailor's life, want and plenty, rest and strife, his roving fancy, like the wind, that nothing can stay and nothing can bind, and the magic charm of foreign lands, with shadows of palms, and shining sands, where the tumbling surf, o'er the coral reefs of madagascar, washes the feet of the swarthy lascar, as he lies alone and asleep on the turf. and the trembling maiden held her breath at the tales of that awful, pitiless sea, with all its terror and mystery, the dim, dark sea, so like unto death, that divides and yet unites mankind! and whenever the old man paused, a gleam from the bowl of his pipe would awhile illume the silent group in the twilight gloom, and thoughtful faces, as in a dream; and for a moment one might mark what had been hidden by the dark, that the head of the maiden lay at rest, tenderly, on the young man's breast! day by day the vessel grew, with timbers fashioned strong and true, stemson and keelson and sternson-knee, till, framed with perfect symmetry, a skeleton ship rose up to view! and around the bows and along the side the heavy hammers and mallets plied, till after many a week, at length, wonderful for form and strength, sublime in its enormous bulk, loomed aloft the shadowy hulk! and around it columns of smoke, upwreathing, rose from the boiling, bubbling, seething caldron, that glowed, and overflowed with the black tar, heated for the sheathing. and amid the clamors of clattering hammers, he who listened heard now and then the song of the master and his men: — ""build me straight, o worthy master, staunch and strong, a goodly vessel, that shall laugh at all disaster, and with wave and whirlwind wrestle!"" with oaken brace and copper band, lay the rudder on the sand, that, like a thought, should have control over the movement of the whole; and near it the anchor, whose giant hand would reach down and grapple with the land, and immovable and fast hold the great ship against the bellowing blast! and at the bows an image stood, by a cunning artist carved in wood, with robes of white, that far behind seemed to be fluttering in the wind. it was not shaped in a classic mould, not like a nymph or goddess of old, or naiad rising from the water, but modelled from the master's daughter! on many a dreary and misty night, 't will be seen by the rays of the signal light, speeding along through the rain and the dark, like a ghost in its snow-white sark, the pilot of some phantom bark, guiding the vessel, in its flight, by a path none other knows aright! behold, at last, each tall and tapering mast is swung into its place; shrouds and stays holding it firm and fast! long ago, in the deer-haunted forests of maine, when upon mountain and plain lay the snow, they fell, — those lordly pines! those grand, majestic pines! 'mid shouts and cheers the jaded steers, panting beneath the goad, dragged down the weary, winding road those captive kings so straight and tall, to be shorn of their streaming hair, and naked and bare, to feel the stress and the strain of the wind and the reeling main, whose roar would remind them forevermore of their native forests they should not see again. and everywhere the slender, graceful spars poise aloft in the air, and at the mast-head, white, blue, and red, a flag unrolls the stripes and stars. ah! when the wanderer, lonely, friendless, in foreign harbors shall behold that flag unrolled, 't will be as a friendly hand stretched out from his native land, filling his heart with memories sweet and endless! all is finished! and at length has come the bridal day of beauty and of strength. to-day the vessel shall be launched! with fleecy clouds the sky is blanched, and o'er the bay, slowly, in all his splendors dight, the great sun rises to behold the sight. the ocean old, centuries old, strong as youth, and as uncontrolled, paces restless to and fro, up and down the sands of gold. his beating heart is not at rest; and far and wide, with ceaseless flow, his beard of snow heaves with the heaving of his breast. he waits impatient for his bride. there she stands, with her foot upon the sands, decked with flags and streamers gay, in honor of her marriage day, her snow-white signals fluttering, blending, round her like a veil descending, ready to be the bride of the gray old sea. on the deck another bride is standing by her lover's side. shadows from the flags and shrouds, like the shadows cast by clouds, broken by many a sunny fleck, fall around them on the deck. the prayer is said, the service read, the joyous bridegroom bows his head; and in tears the good old master shakes the brown hand of his son, kisses his daughter's glowing cheek in silence, for he cannot speak, and ever faster down his own the tears begin to run. the worthy pastor — the shepherd of that wandering flock, that has the ocean for its wold, that has the vessel for its fold, leaping ever from rock to rock — spake, with accents mild and clear, words of warning, words of cheer, but tedious to the bridegroom's ear. he knew the chart of the sailor's heart, all its pleasures and its griefs, all its shallows and rocky reefs, all those secret currents, that flow with such resistless undertow, and lift and drift, with terrible force, the will from its moorings and its course. therefore he spake, and thus said he: — ""like unto ships far off at sea, outward or homeward bound, are we. before, behind, and all around, floats and swings the horizon's bound, seems at its distant rim to rise and climb the crystal wall of the skies, and then again to turn and sink, as if we could slide from its outer brink. ah! it is not the sea, it is not the sea that sinks and shelves, but ourselves that rock and rise with endless and uneasy motion, now touching the very skies, now sinking into the depths of ocean. ah! if our souls but poise and swing like the compass in its brazen ring, ever level and ever true to the toil and the task we have to do, we shall sail securely, and safely reach the fortunate isles, on whose shining beach the sights we see, and the sounds we hear, will be those of joy and not of fear!"" then the master, with a gesture of command, waved his hand; and at the word, loud and sudden there was heard, all around them and below, the sound of hammers, blow on blow, knocking away the shores and spurs. and see! she stirs! she starts, — she moves, — she seems to feel the thrill of life along her keel, and, spurning with her foot the ground, with one exulting, joyous bound, she leaps into the ocean's arms! and lo! from the assembled crowd there rose a shout, prolonged and loud, that to the ocean seemed to say, ""take her, o bridegroom, old and gray, take her to thy protecting arms, with all her youth and all her charms!"" how beautiful she is! how fair she lies within those arms, that press her form with many a soft caress of tenderness and watchful care! sail forth into the sea, o ship! through wind and wave, right onward steer! the moistened eye, the trembling lip, are not the signs of doubt or fear. sail forth into the sea of life, o gentle, loving, trusting wife, and safe from all adversity upon the bosom of that sea thy comings and thy goings be! for gentleness and love and trust prevail o'er angry wave and gust; and in the wreck of noble lives something immortal still survives! thou, too, sail on, o ship of state! sail on, o union, strong and great! humanity with all its fears, with all the hopes of future years, is hanging breathless on thy fate! we know what master laid thy keel, what workmen wrought thy ribs of steel, who made each mast, and sail, and rope, what anvils rang, what hammers beat, in what a forge and what a heat were shaped the anchors of thy hope!

12365,6935,"<line> <line>[introduction] lo now! four other acts upon the stage, childhood, and youth, the manly, and old-age. the first: son unto phlegm, grand-child to water, unstable, supple, moist, and cold’s his nature. the second: frolic claims his pedigree; from blood and air, for hot and moist is he. the third of fire and choler is compos’d, vindicative, and quarrelsome dispos’d. the last, of earth and heavy melancholy, solid, hating all lightness, and all folly. childhood was cloth’d in white, and given to show, his spring was intermixed with some snow. upon his head a garland nature set: of daisy, primrose, and the violet. such cold mean flowers (as these) blossom betime, before the sun hath throughly warm’d the clime. his hobby striding, did not ride, but run, and in his hand an hour-glass new begun, in dangers every moment of a fall, and when ‘tis broke, then ends his life and all. but if he held till it have run its last, then may he live till threescore years or past. next, youth came up in gorgeous attire (as that fond age, doth most of all desire), his suit of crimson, and his scarf of green. in’s countenance, his pride quickly was seen. garland of roses, pinks, and gillyflowers seemed to grow on’s head (bedew’d with showers). his face as fresh, as is aurora fair, when blushing first, she ‘gins to red the air. no wooden horse, but one of metal try’d: he seems to fly, or swim, and not to ride. then prancing on the stage, about he wheels; but as he went, death waited at his heels. the next came up, in a more graver sort, as one that cared for a good report. his sword by’s side, and choler in his eyes, but neither us’d (as yet) for he was wise, of autumn fruits a basket on his arm, his golden rod in’s purse, which was his charm. and last of all, to act upon this stage, leaning upon his staff, comes up old age. under his arm a sheaf of wheat he bore, a harvest of the best: what needs he more? in’s other hand a glass, ev’n almost run, this writ about: this out, then i am done. his hoary hairs and grave aspect made way, and all gave ear to what he had to say. these being met, each in his equipage intend to speak, according to their age, but wise old-age did with all gravity to childish childhood give precedency, and to the rest, his reason mildly told: that he was young, before he grew so old. to do as he, the rest full soon assents, their method was that of the elements, that each should tell what of himself he knew, both good and bad, but yet no more then’s true. with heed now stood, three ages of frail man, to hear the child, who crying, thus began. childhood ah me! conceiv’d in sin, and born in sorrow, a nothing, here to day, but gone to morrow, whose mean beginning, blushing can’t reveal, but night and darkness must with shame conceal. my mother’s breeding sickness, i will spare, her nine months’ weary burden not declare. to shew her bearing pangs, i should do wrong, to tell that pain, which can’t be told by tongue. with tears into this world i did arrive; my mother still did waste, as i did thrive, who yet with love and all alacity, spending was willing to be spent for me. with wayward cries, i did disturb her rest, who sought still to appease me with her breast; with weary arms, she danc’d, and by, by, sung, when wretched i (ungrate) had done the wrong. when infancy was past, my childishness did act all folly that it could express. my silliness did only take delight, in that which riper age did scorn and slight, in rattles, bables, and such toyish stuff. my then ambitious thoughts were low enough. my high-born soul so straitly was confin’d that its own worth it did not know nor mind. this little house of flesh did spacious count, through ignorance, all troubles did surmount, yet this advantage had mine ignorance, freedom from envy and from arrogance. how to be rich, or great, i did not cark, a baron or a duke ne’r made my mark, nor studious was, kings favours how to buy, with costly presents, or base flattery; no office coveted, wherein i might make strong my self and turn aside weak right. no malice bare to this or that great peer, nor unto buzzing whisperers gave ear. i gave no hand, nor vote, for death, of life. i’d nought to do, ‘twixt prince, and peoples’ strife. no statist i: nor marti’list i’ th’ field. where e’re i went, mine innocence was shield. my quarrels, not for diadems, did rise, but for an apple, plumb, or some such prize. my strokes did cause no death, nor wounds, nor scars. my little wrath did cease soon as my wars. my duel was no challenge, nor did seek. my foe should weltering, with his bowels reek. i had no suits at law, neighbours to vex, nor evidence for land did me perplex. i fear’d no storms, nor all the winds that blows. i had no ships at sea, no fraughts to loose. i fear’d no drought, nor wet; i had no crop, nor yet on future things did place my hope. this was mine innocence, but oh the seeds lay raked up of all the cursed weeds, which sprouted forth in my insuing age, as he can tell, that next comes on the stage. but yet me let me relate, before i go, the sins and dangers i am subject to: from birth stained, with adam’s sinful fact, from thence i ‘gan to sin, as soon as act; a perverse will, a love to what’s forbid; a serpent’s sting in pleasing face lay hid; a lying tongue as soon as it could speak and fifth commandment do daily break; oft stubborn, peevish, sullen, pout, and cry; then nought can please, and yet i know not why. as many was my sins, so dangers too, for sin brings sorrow, sickness, death, and woe, and though i miss the tossings of the mind, yet griefs in my frail flesh i still do find. what gripes of wind, mine infancy did pain? what tortures i, in breeding teeth sustain? what crudities my cold stomach hath bred? whence vomits, worms, and flux have issued? what breaches, knocks, and falls i daily have? and some perhaps, i carry to my grave. sometimes in fire, sometimes in water fall: strangely preserv’d, yet mind it not at all. at home, abroad, my danger’s manifold that wonder ‘tis, my glass till now doth hold. i’ve done: unto my elders i give way, for ‘tis but little that a child can say. youth my goodly clothing and beauteous skin declare some greater riches are within, but what is best i‘ll first present to view, and then the worst, in a more ugly hue, for thus to do we on this stage assemble, then let not him, which hath most craft dissemble. mine education, and my learning‘s such, as might my self, and others, profit much: with nurture trained up in virtue‘s schools; of science, arts, and tongues, i know the rules; the manners of the court, i likewise know, nor ignorant what they in country do. the brave attempts of valiant knights i prize that dare climb battlements, rear‘d to the skies. the snorting horse, the trumpet, drum i like, the glist‘ring sword, and well advanced pike. i cannot lie in trench before a town, nor wait til good advice our hopes do crown. i scorn the heavy corslet, musket-proof; i fly to catch the bullet that‘s aloof. though thus in field, at home, to all most kind, so affable that i do suit each mind, i can insinuate into the breast and by my mirth can raise the heart deprest. sweet music rapteth my harmonious soul, and elevates my thoughts above the pole. my wit, my bounty, and my courtesy makes all to place their future hopes on me. this is my best, but youth (is known) alas, to be as wild as is the snuffing ass, as vain as froth, as vanity can be, that who would see vain man may look on me: my gifts abus‘d, my education lost, my woful parents‘ longing hopes all crost; my wit evaporates in merriment; my valour in some beastly quarrel‘s spent; martial deeds i love not, ‘cause they’re virtuous, but doing so, might seem magnanimous. my lust doth hurry me to all that’s ill, i know no law, nor reason, but my will; sometimes lay wait to take a wealthy purse or stab the man in’s own defence, that’s worse. sometimes i cheat (unkind) a female heir of all at once, who not so wise, as fair, trusteth my loving looks and glozing tongue until her friends, treasure, and honour’s gone. sometimes i sit carousing others’ health until mine own be gone, my wit, and wealth. from pipe to pot, from pot to words and blows, for he that loveth wine wanteth no woes. days, nights, with ruffins, roarers, fiddlers spend, to all obscenity my ears i bend, all counsel hate which tends to make me wise, and dearest friends count for mine enemies. if any care i take, ‘tis to be fine, for sure my suit more than my virtues shine. if any time from company i spare, ‘tis spent in curling, frisling up my hair, some young adonais i do strive to be. sardana pallas now survives in me. cards, dice, and oaths, concomitant, i love; to masques, to plays, to taverns still i move; and in a word, if what i am you’d hear, seek out a british, bruitish cavalier. such wretch, such monster am i; but yet more i want a heart all this for to deplore. thus, thus alas! i have mispent my time, my youth, my best, my strength, my bud, and prime, remembring not the dreadful day of doom, nor yet the heavy reckoning for to come, though dangers do attend me every hour and ghastly death oft threats me with her power: sometimes by wounds in idle combats taken, sometimes by agues all my body shaken; sometimes by fevers, all my moisture drinking, my heart lies frying, and my eyes are sinking. sometimes the cough, stitch, painful pleurisy, with sad affrights of death, do menace me. sometimes the loathsome pox my face be-mars with ugly marks of his eternal scars. sometimes the frenzy strangely mads my brain that oft for it in bedlam i remain. too many’s my diseases to recite, that wonder ‘tis i yet behold the light, that yet my bed in darkness is not made, and i in black oblivion’s den long laid. of marrow full my bones, of milk my breasts, ceas’d by the gripes of serjeant death's arrests: thus i have said, and what i’ve said you see, childhood and youth is vain, yea vanity. middle age childhood and youth forgot, sometimes i’ve seen, and now am grown more staid that have been green, what they have done, the same was done by me: as was their praise, or shame, so mine must be. now age is more, more good ye do expect; but more my age, the more is my defect. but what’s of worth, your eyes shall first behold, and then a world of dross among my gold. when my wild oats were sown, and ripe, and mown, i then receiv’d a harvest of mine own. my reason, then bad judge, how little hope such empty seed should yield a better crop. i then with both hands graspt the world together, thus out of one extreme into another, but yet laid hold on virtue seemingly: who climbs without hold, climbs dangerously. be my condition mean, i then take pains my family to keep, but not for gains. if rich, i’m urged then to gather more to bear me out i’ th’ world and feed the poor; if a father, then for children must provide, but if none, then for kindred near ally’d; if noble, then mine honour to maintain; if not, yet wealth, nobility can gain. for time, for place, likewise for each relation, i wanted not my ready allegation. yet all my powers for self-ends are not spent, for hundreds bless me for my bounty sent, whose loins i’ve cloth’d, and bellies i have fed, with mine own fleece, and with my household bread. yea, justice i have done, was i in place, to cheer the good and wicked to deface. the proud i crush’d, th’oppressed i set free, the liars curb’d but nourisht verity. was i a pastor, i my flock did feed and gently lead the lambs, as they had need. a captain i, with skill i train’d my band and shew’d them how in face of foes to stand. if a soldier, with speed i did obey as readily as could my leader say. was i a laborer, i wrought all day as cheerfully as ere i took my pay. thus hath mine age (in all) sometimes done well; sometimes mine age (in all) been worse than hell. in meanness, greatness, riches, poverty did toil, did broil; oppress’d, did steal and lie. was i as poor as poverty could be, then baseness was companion unto me. such scum as hedges and high-ways do yield, as neither sow, nor reap, nor plant, nor build. if to agriculture i was ordain’d, great labours, sorrows, crosses i sustain’d. the early cock did summon, but in vain, my wakeful thoughts up to my painful gain. for restless day and night, i’m robb’d of sleep by cankered care, who sentinel doth keep. my weary breast rest from his toil can find, but if i rest, the more distrest my mind. if happiness my sordidness hath found, ‘twas in the crop of my manured ground: my fatted ox, and my exuberous cow, my fleeced ewe, and ever farrowing sow. to greater things i never did aspire, my dunghill thoughts or hopes could reach no higher. if to be rich, or great, it was my fate. how was i broil’d with envy, and with hate? greater than was the great’st was my desire, and greater still, did set my heart on fire. if honour was the point to which i steer’d, to run my hull upon disgrace i fear’d, but by ambitious sails i was so carried that over flats, and sands, and rocks i hurried, opprest, and sunk, and sack’d, all in my way that did oppose me to my longed bay. my thirst was higher than nobility and oft long’d sore to taste on royalty, whence poison, pistols, and dread instruments have been curst furtherers of mine intents. nor brothers, nephews, sons, nor sires i’ve spar’d. when to a monarchy my way they barr'’d, there set, i rid my self straight out of hand of such as might my son, or his withstand, then heapt up gold and riches as the clay, which others scatter like the dew in may. sometimes vain-glory is the only bait whereby my empty school is lur’d and caught. be i of worth, of learning, or of parts, i judge i should have room in all men’s hearts; and envy gnaws if any do surmount. i hate for to be had in small account. if bias like, i’m stript unto my skin; i glory in my wealth i have within. thus good, and bad, and what i am, you see, now in a word, what my diseases be: the vexing stone, in bladder and in reins, torments me with intolerable pains; the windy cholic oft my bowels rend, to break the darksome prison, where it’s penn’d; the knotty gout doth sadly torture me, and the restraining lame sciatica; the quinsy and the fevers often distaste me, and the consumption to the bones doth waste me, subject to all diseases, that’s the truth, though some more incident to age, or youth; and to conclude, i may not tedious be, man at his best estate is vanity. old age what you have been, ev’n such have i before, and all you say, say i, and something more. babe's innocence, youth’s wildness i have seen, and in perplexed middle-age have been, sickness, dangers, and anxieties have past, and on this stage am come to act my last. i have been young, and strong, and wise as you but now, bis pueri senes is too true. in every age i’ve found much vanity. an end of all perfection now i see. it’s not my valour, honour, nor my gold, my ruin’d house, now falling can uphold; it’s not my learning, rhetoric, wit so large, now hath the power, death’s warfare, to discharge. it’s not my goodly house, nor bed of down, that can refresh, or ease, if conscience frown; nor from alliance now can i have hope, but what i have done well, that is my prop. he that in youth is godly, wise, and sage provides a staff for to support his age. great mutations, some joyful, and some sad, in this short pilgrimage i oft have had. sometimes the heavens with plenty smil’d on me, sometimes, again, rain’d all adversity; sometimes in honour, sometimes in disgrace, sometime an abject, then again in place: such private changes oft mine eyes have seen. in various times of state i’ve also been. i’ve seen a kingdom flourish like a tree when it was rul’d by that celestial she, and like a cedar others so surmount that but for shrubs they did themselves account. then saw i france, and holland sav’d, calais won, and philip and albertus half undone. i saw all peace at home, terror to foes, but ah, i saw at last those eyes to close, and then, me thought, the world at noon grew dark when it had lost that radiant sun-like spark. in midst of griefs, i saw some hopes revive (for ‘twas our hopes then kept our hearts alive); i saw hopes dash’t, our forwardness was shent, and silenc’d we, by act of parliament. i’ve seen from rome, an execrable thing, a plot to blow up nobles and their king. i’ve seen designs at ree and cades cross’t, and poor palatinate for every lost. i’ve seen a prince to live on others’ lands, a royal one, by alms from subjects’ hands. i’ve seen base men, advanc’d to great degree, and worthy ones, put to extremity, but not their prince’s love, nor state so high, could once reverse, their shameful destiny. i’ve seen one stabb’d, another lose his head, and others fly their country through their dread. i’ve seen, and so have ye, for ‘tis but late, the desolation of a goodly state. plotted and acted so that none can tell who gave the counsell, but the prince of hell. i’ve seen a land unmoulded with great pain, but yet may live to see’t made up again. i’ve seen it shaken, rent, and soak’d in blood, but out of troubles ye may see much good. these are no old wives’ tales, but this is truth. we old men love to tell, what’s done in youth. but i return from whence i stept awry; my memory is short and brain is dry. my almond-tree (gray hairs) doth flourish now, and back, once straight, begins apace to bow. my grinders now are few, my sight doth fail, my skin is wrinkled, and my cheeks are pale. no more rejoice, at music’s pleasant noise, but do awake at the cock’s clanging voice. i cannot scent savours of pleasant meat, nor sapors find in what i drink or eat. my hands and arms, once strong, have lost their might. i cannot labour, nor i cannot fight: my comely legs, as nimble as the roe, now stiff and numb, can hardly creep or go. my heart sometimes as fierce, as lion bold, now trembling, and fearful, sad, and cold. my golden bowl and silver cord, e’re long, shall both be broke, by wracking death so strong. i then shall go whence i shall come no more. sons, nephews, leave, my death for to deplore. in pleasures, and in labours, i have found that earth can give no consolation sound to great, to rich, to poor, to young, or old, to mean, to noble, fearful, or to bold. from king to beggar, all degrees shall find but vanity, vexation of the mind. yea, knowing much, the pleasant’st life of all hath yet amongst that sweet, some bitter gall. though reading others’ works doth much refresh, yet studying much brings weariness to th’ flesh. my studies, labours, readings all are done, and my last period can e’en elmost run. corruption, my father, i do call, mother, and sisters both; the worms that crawl in my dark house, such kindred i have store. there i shall rest till heavens shall be no more; and when this flesh shall rot and be consum’d, this body, by this soul, shall be assum’d; and i shall see with these same very eyes my strong redeemer coming in the skies. triumph i shall, o’re sin, o’re death, o’re hell, and in that hope, i bid you all farewell. <line>","living,time & brevity,nature,trees & flowers,weather,religion,christianity,faith & doubt,god & the divine,arts & sciences,philosophy"

12455,6408,"<line> <line>was it pascal who said “almost all our misery has come from not being able to remain alone in our rooms”? baudelaire thought it might have been, but was not sure. and let’s take a look at that “almost” which i’m very glad is there. i can think of lots of misery that had nothing to do with my not having been alone in my room. when i get a rejection email on a train for a piece of work i had high hopes for is one example. or to go way back, when i returned home to find my white mouse dead when i was eleven or twelve. or to take a mundane example, when a plane i’m booked on is twelve hours delayed, while i hang about the airport. <line> <line>i have never had a huge problem with solitude, it is true. as a child i read voraciously, and would find some hidden corner to lurk with my book. the game of golf is one where one can enjoy being alone, especially very early on a beautiful morning. the time when i most felt alone was when the missionaries came to my school and we all had to endure a silent retreat for three days. at the end of that time i felt like one of those astronauts in films who have to stay on the moon for months. <line> <line>baudelaire claimed his friend the devil loved bleak, solitary places where the spirit of murder and lust was more likely to ignite. he decided that this was not really a danger for most of us, though, only for those idle, fanciful folk prone to enigmas and dreaming. the type of person who should most avoid being alone is a chatterbox or maybe a television pundit. but what’s to stop these people being verbose in their own company? did crusoe, for example, stay quiet on his island before friday came? according to elizabeth bishop in her great poem, “crusoe in england,” he did not. <line> <line>and in order to write that poem, ms. bishop needed to be alone. this did not stop her from cooking meals and inviting friends to help her eat the food and drink wine with her. after this, probably the next morning, she went back to the poem and her solitude. <line> <line>i feel the french maybe exaggerate the benefits of being alone. that philosopher and writer jean-paul sartre for example, his play huis-clos with its famous line “l’enfer, c’est les autres.” yes, we all know how annoying other people often are, and how strong the urge to escape from them can be. but the two characters vladimir and estragon in beckett’s waiting for godot show that even in an absurdist setting companionship has its importance. it’s said beckett got his inspiration for this play from one or other of two versions of caspar david friedrich’s painting two men contemplating the moon which he saw on a trip to germany in 1936 or ’37. in both versions of the painting one of the men has his hand on the other man’s shoulder, a sign of companionship if ever there was one. <line> <line>baudelaire quotes the french philosopher and moralist jean de la bruyère (or delabruyère, as the man signed himself), “what a great misfortune we cannot be alone,” as if to chastise anyone who wants to plunge into a crowd or go into a busy bar. what about the great french word fraternité, the third of the three words that were the rallying cry of the revolution? i want to close this by giving another quote from de la bruyère: “out of difficulties grow miracles.” i prefer this one. anyone in an awkward social situation should dwell on that. <line>","living,life choices,the mind,activities,eating & drinking,arts & sciences,philosophy,poetry & poets"

"" then arthur turn'd to kay the seneschal, ""take thou my churl, and tend him curiously like a king's heir, till all his hurts be whole. the heathen—but that ever-climbing wave, hurl'd back again so often in empty foam, hath lain for years at rest—and renegades, thieves, bandits, leavings of confusion, whom the wholesome realm is purged of otherwhere, friends, thro' your manhood and your fealty,—now make their last head like satan in the north. my younger knights, new-made, in whom your flower waits to be solid fruit of golden deeds, move with me toward their quelling, which achieved, the loneliest ways are safe from shore to shore. but thou, sir lancelot, sitting in my place enchair'd to-morrow, arbitrate the field; for wherefore shouldst thou care to mingle with it only to yield my queen her own again? speak, lancelot, thou art silent: is it well?"" thereto sir lancelot answer'd, ""it is well: yet better if the king abide, and leave the leading of his younger knights to me. else, for the king has will'd it, it is well."" then arthur rose and lancelot follow'd him, and while they stood without the doors, the king turn'd to him saying, ""is it then so well? or mine the blame that oft i seem as he of whom was written, 'a sound is in his ears'? the foot that loiters, bidden go,—the glance that only seems half-loyal to command,— a manner somewhat fall'n from reverence— or have i dream'd the bearing of our knights tells of a manhood ever less and lower? or whence the fear lest this my realm, uprear'd, by noble deeds at one with noble vows, from flat confusion and brute violences, reel back into the beast, and be no more?"" he spoke, and taking all his younger knights, down the slope city rode, and sharply turn'd north by the gate. in her high bower the queen, working a tapestry, lifted up her head, watch'd her lord pass, and knew not that she sigh'd. then ran across her memory the strange rhyme of bygone merlin, ""where is he who knows? from the great deep to the great deep he goes."" but when the morning of a tournament, by these in earnest those in mockery call'd the tournament of the dead innocence, brake with a wet wind blowing, lancelot, round whose sick head all night, like birds of prey, the words of arthur flying shriek'd, arose, and down a streetway hung with folds of pure white samite, and by fountains running wine, where children sat in white with cups of gold, moved to the lists, and there, with slow sad steps ascending, fill'd his double-dragon'd chair. he glanced and saw the stately galleries, dame, damsel, each thro' worship of their queen white-robed in honour of the stainless child, and some with scatter'd jewels, like a bank of maiden snow mingled with sparks of fire. he look'd but once, and vail'd his eyes again. the sudden trumpet sounded as in a dream to ears but half-awaked, then one low roll of autumn thunder, and the jousts began: and ever the wind blew, and yellowing leaf and gloom and gleam, and shower and shorn plume went down it. sighing weariedly, as one who sits and gazes on a faded fire, when all the goodlier guests are past away, sat their great umpire, looking o'er the lists. he saw the laws that ruled the tournament broken, but spake not; once, a knight cast down before his throne of arbitration cursed the dead babe and the follies of the king; and once the laces of a helmet crack'd, and show'd him, like a vermin in its hole, modred, a narrow face: anon he heard the voice that billow'd round the barriers roar an ocean-sounding welcome to one knight, but newly-enter'd, taller than the rest, and armour'd all in forest green, whereon there tript a hundred tiny silver deer, and wearing but a holly-spray for crest, with ever-scattering berries, and on shield a spear, a harp, a bugle—tristram—late from overseas in brittany return'd, and marriage with a princess of that realm, isolt the white—sir tristram of the woods— whom lancelot knew, had held sometime with pain his own against him, and now yearn'd to shake the burthen off his heart in one full shock with tristram ev'n to death: his strong hands gript and dinted the gilt dragons right and left, until he groan'd for wrath—so many of those, that ware their ladies' colours on the casque, drew from before sir tristram to the bounds, and there with gibes and flickering mockeries stood, while he mutter'd, ""craven crests! o shame! what faith have these in whom they sware to love? the glory of our round table is no more."" so tristram won, and lancelot gave, the gems, not speaking other word than ""hast thou won? art thou the purest, brother? see, the hand wherewith thou takest this, is red!"" to whom tristram, half plagued by lancelot's languorous mood, made answer, ""ay, but wherefore toss me this like a dry bone cast to some hungry hound? let be thy fair queen's fantasy. strength of heart and might of limb, but mainly use and skill, are winners in this pastime of our king. my hand—belike the lance hath dript upon it— no blood of mine, i trow; but o chief knight, right arm of arthur in the battlefield, great brother, thou nor i have made the world; be happy in thy fair queen as i in mine."" and tristram round the gallery made his horse caracole; then bow'd his homage, bluntly saying, ""fair damsels, each to him who worships each sole queen of beauty and of love, behold this day my queen of beauty is not here."" and most of these were mute, some anger'd, one murmuring, ""all courtesy is dead,"" and one, ""the glory of our round table is no more."" then fell thick rain, plume droopt and mantle clung, and pettish cries awoke, and the wan day went glooming down in wet and weariness: but under her black brows a swarthy one laugh'd shrilly, crying, ""praise the patient saints, our one white day of innocence hath past, tho' somewhat draggled at the skirt. so be it. the snowdrop only, flowering thro' the year, would make the world as blank as winter-tide. come—let us gladden their sad eyes, our queen's and lancelot's, at this night's solemnity with all the kindlier colours of the field."" so dame and damsel glitter'd at the feast variously gay: for he that tells the tale liken'd them, saying, as when an hour of cold falls on the mountain in midsummer snows, and all the purple slopes of mountain flowers pass under white, till the warm hour returns with veer of wind, and all are flowers again; so dame and damsel cast the simple white, and glowing in all colours, the live grass, rose-campion, bluebell, kingcup, poppy, glanced about the revels, and with mirth so loud beyond all use, that, half-amazed, the queen, and wroth at tristram and the lawless jousts, brake up their sports, then slowly to her bower parted, and in her bosom pain was lord. and little dagonet on the morrow morn, high over all the yellowing autumn-tide, danced like a wither'd leaf before the hall. then tristram saying, ""why skip ye so, sir fool?"" wheel'd round on either heel, dagonet replied, ""belike for lack of wiser company; or being fool, and seeing too much wit makes the world rotten, why, belike i skip to know myself the wisest knight of all."" ""ay, fool,"" said tristram, ""but 'tis eating dry to dance without a catch, a roundelay to dance to."" then he twangled on his harp, and while he twangled little dagonet stood quiet as any water-sodden log stay'd in the wandering warble of a brook; but when the twangling ended, skipt again; and being ask'd, ""why skipt ye not, sir fool?"" made answer, ""i had liefer twenty years skip to the broken music of my brains than any broken music thou canst make."" then tristram, waiting for the quip to come, ""good now, what music have i broken, fool?"" and little dagonet, skipping, ""arthur, the king's; for when thou playest that air with queen isolt, thou makest broken music with thy bride, her daintier namesake down in brittany— and so thou breakest arthur's music, too."" ""save for that broken music in thy brains, sir fool,"" said tristram, ""i would break thy head. fool, i came late, the heathen wars were o'er, the life had flown, we sware but by the shell— i am but a fool to reason with a fool— come, thou art crabb'd and sour: but lean me down, sir dagonet, one of thy long asses' ears, and harken if my music be not true. ""'free love—free field—we love but while we may: the woods are hush'd, their music is no more: the leaf is dead, the yearning past away: new leaf, new life—the days of frost are o'er: new life, new love, to suit the newer day: new loves are sweet as those that went before: free love—free field—we love but while we may.' ""ye might have moved slow-measure to my tune, not stood stockstill. i made it in the woods, and heard it ring as true as tested gold."" but dagonet with one foot poised in his hand, ""friend, did ye mark that fountain yesterday made to run wine?—but this had run itself all out like a long life to a sour end— and them that round it sat with golden cups to hand the wine to whosoever came— the twelve small damosels white as innocence, in honour of poor innocence the babe, who left the gems which innocence the queen lent to the king, and innocence the king gave for a prize—and one of those white slips handed her cup and piped, the pretty one, 'drink, drink, sir fool,' and thereupon i drank, spat—pish—the cup was gold, the draught was mud."" and tristram, ""was it muddier than thy gibes? is all the laughter gone dead out of thee?— not marking how the knighthood mock thee, fool— 'fear god: honour the king—his one true knight— sole follower of the vows'—for here be they who knew thee swine enow before i came, smuttier than blasted grain: but when the king had made thee fool, thy vanity so shot up it frighted all free fool from out thy heart; which left thee less than fool, and less than swine, a naked aught—yet swine i hold thee still, for i have flung thee pearls and find thee swine."" and little dagonet mincing with his feet, ""knight, an ye fling those rubies round my neck in lieu of hers, i'll hold thou hast some touch of music, since i care not for thy pearls. swine? i have wallow'd, i have wash'd—the world is flesh and shadow—i have had my day. the dirty nurse, experience, in her kind hath foul'd me—an i wallow'd, then i wash'd— i have had my day and my philosophies— and thank the lord i am king arthur's fool. swine, say ye? swine, goats, asses, rams and geese troop'd round a paynim harper once, who thrumm'd on such a wire as musically as thou some such fine song—but never a king's fool."" and tristram, ""then were swine, goats, asses, geese the wiser fools, seeing thy paynim bard had such a mastery of his mystery that he could harp his wife up out of hell."" then dagonet, turning on the ball of his foot, ""and whither harp'st thou thine? down! and thyself down! and two more: a helpful harper thou, that harpest downward! dost thou know the star we call the harp of arthur up in heaven?"" and tristram, ""ay, sir fool, for when our king was victor wellnigh day by day, the knights, glorying in each new glory, set his name high on all hills, and in the signs of heaven."" and dagonet answer'd, ""ay, and when the land was freed, and the queen false, ye set yourself to babble about him, all to show your wit— and whether he were king by courtesy, or king by right—and so went harping down the black king's highway, got so far, and grew so witty that we play'd at ducks and drakes with arthur's vows on the great lake of fire. tuwhoo! do ye see it? do ye see the star?"" ""nay, fool,"" said tristram, ""not in open day."" and dagonet, ""nay, nor will: i see it and hear. it makes a silent music up in heaven, and i, and arthur and the angels hear, and then we skip."" ""lo, fool,"" he said, ""ye talk fool's treason: is the king thy brother fool?"" then little dagonet clapt his hands and shrill'd, ""ay, ay, my brother fool, the king of fools! conceits himself as god that he can make figs out of thistles, silk from bristles, milk from burning spurge, honey from hornet-combs, and men from beasts—long live the king of fools!"" and down the city dagonet danced away; but thro' the slowly-mellowing avenues and solitary passes of the wood rode tristram toward lyonnesse and the west. before him fled the face of queen isolt with ruby-circled neck, but evermore past, as a rustle or twitter in the wood made dull his inner, keen his outer eye for all that walk'd, or crept, or perch'd, or flew. anon the face, as, when a gust hath blown, unruffling waters re-collect the shape of one that in them sees himself, return'd; but at the slot or fewmets of a deer, or ev'n a fall'n feather, vanish'd again. so on for all that day from lawn to lawn thro' many a league-long bower he rode. at length a lodge of intertwisted beechen-boughs furze-cramm'd, and bracken-rooft, the which himself built for a summer day with queen isolt against a shower, dark in the golden grove appearing, sent his fancy back to where she lived a moon in that low lodge with him: till mark her lord had past, the cornish king, with six or seven, when tristram was away, and snatch'd her thence; yet dreading worse than shame her warrior tristram, spake not any word, but bode his hour, devising wretchedness. and now that desert lodge to tristram lookt so sweet, that halting, in he past, and sank down on a drift of foliage random-blown; but could not rest for musing how to smoothe and sleek his marriage over to the queen. perchance in lone tintagil far from all the tonguesters of the court she had not heard. but then what folly had sent him overseas after she left him lonely here? a name? was it the name of one in brittany, isolt, the daughter of the king? ""isolt of the white hands"" they call'd her: the sweet name allured him first, and then the maid herself, who served him well with those white hands of hers, and loved him well, until himself had thought he loved her also, wedded easily, but left her all as easily, and return'd. the black-blue irish hair and irish eyes had drawn him home—what marvel? then he laid his brows upon the drifted leaf and dream'd. he seem'd to pace the strand of brittany between isolt of britain and his bride, and show'd them both the ruby-chain, and both began to struggle for it, till his queen graspt it so hard, that all her hand was red. then cried the breton, ""look, her hand is red! these be no rubies, this is frozen blood, and melts within her hand—her hand is hot with ill desires, but this i gave thee, look, is all as cool and white as any flower."" follow'd a rush of eagle's wings, and then a whimpering of the spirit of the child, because the twain had spoil'd her carcanet. he dream'd; but arthur with a hundred spears rode far, till o'er the illimitable reed, and many a glancing plash and sallowy isle, the wide-wing'd sunset of the misty marsh glared on a huge machicolated tower that stood with open doors, whereout was roll'd a roar of riot, as from men secure amid their marshes, ruffians at their ease among their harlot-brides, an evil song. ""lo there,"" said one of arthur's youth, for there, high on a grim dead tree before the tower, a goodly brother of the table round swung by the neck: and on the boughs a shield showing a shower of blood in a field noir, and therebeside a horn, inflamed the knights at that dishonour done the gilded spur, till each would clash the shield, and blow the horn. but arthur waved them back. alone he rode. then at the dry harsh roar of the great horn, that sent the face of all the marsh aloft an ever upward-rushing storm and cloud of shriek and plume, the red knight heard, and all, even to tipmost lance and topmost helm, in blood-red armour sallying, howl'd to the king, ""the teeth of hell flay bare and gnash thee flat!— lo! art thou not that eunuch-hearted king who fain had clipt free manhood from the world— the woman-worshipper? yea, god's curse, and i! slain was the brother of my paramour by a knight of thine, and i that heard her whine and snivel, being eunuch-hearted too, sware by the scorpion-worm that twists in hell, and stings itself to everlasting death, to hang whatever knight of thine i fought and tumbled. art thou king?—look to thy life!"" he ended: arthur knew the voice; the face wellnigh was helmet-hidden, and the name went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind. and arthur deign'd not use of word or sword, but let the drunkard, as he stretch'd from horse to strike him, overbalancing his bulk, down from the causeway heavily to the swamp fall, as the crest of some slow-arching wave, heard in dead night along that table-shore, drops flat, and after the great waters break whitening for half a league, and thin themselves, far over sands marbled with moon and cloud, from less and less to nothing; thus he fell head-heavy; then the knights, who watch'd him, roar'd and shouted and leapt down upon the fall'n; there trampled out his face from being known, and sank his head in mire, and slimed themselves: nor heard the king for their own cries, but sprang thro' open doors, and swording right and left men, women, on their sodden faces, hurl'd the tables over and the wines, and slew till all the rafters rang with woman-yells, and all the pavement stream'd with massacre: then, echoing yell with yell, they fired the tower, which half that autumn night, like the live north, red-pulsing up thro' alioth and alcor, made all above it, and a hundred meres about it, as the water moab saw come round by the east, and out beyond them flush'd the long low dune, and lazy-plunging sea. so all the ways were safe from shore to shore, but in the heart of arthur pain was lord. then, out of tristram waking, the red dream fled with a shout, and that low lodge return'd, mid-forest, and the wind among the boughs. he whistled his good warhorse left to graze among the forest greens, vaulted upon him, and rode beneath an ever-showering leaf, till one lone woman, weeping near a cross, stay'd him. ""why weep ye?"" ""lord,"" she said, ""my man hath left me or is dead""; whereon he thought— ""what, if she hate me now? i would not this. what, if she love me still? i would not that. i know not what i would""—but said to her, ""yet weep not thou, lest, if thy mate return, he find thy favour changed and love thee not""— then pressing day by day thro' lyonnesse last in a roky hollow, belling, heard the hounds of mark, and felt the goodly hounds yelp at his heart, but turning, past and gain'd tintagil, half in sea, and high on land, a crown of towers. down in a casement sat, a low sea-sunset glorying round her hair and glossy-throated grace, isolt the queen. and when she heard the feet of tristram grind the spiring stone that scaled about her tower, flush'd, started, met him at the doors, and there belted his body with her white embrace, crying aloud, ""not mark—not mark, my soul! the footstep flutter'd me at first: not he: catlike thro' his own castle steals my mark, but warrior-wise thou stridest thro' his halls who hates thee, as i him—ev'n to the death. my soul, i felt my hatred for my mark quicken within me, and knew that thou wert nigh."" to whom sir tristram smiling, ""i am here. let be thy mark, seeing he is not thine."" and drawing somewhat backward she replied, ""can he be wrong'd who is not ev'n his own, but save for dread of thee had beaten me, scratch'd, bitten, blinded, marr'd me somehow—mark? what rights are his that dare not strike for them? not lift a hand—not, tho' he found me thus! but harken! have ye met him? hence he went to-day for three days' hunting—as he said— and so returns belike within an hour. mark's way, my soul!—but eat not thou with mark, because he hates thee even more than fears; nor drink: and when thou passest any wood close vizor, lest an arrow from the bush should leave me all alone with mark and hell. my god, the measure of my hate for mark is as the measure of my love for thee.'' so, pluck'd one way by hate and one by love, drain'd of her force, again she sat, and spake to tristram, as he knelt before her, saying, ""o hunter, and o blower of the horn, harper, and thou hast been a rover too, for, ere i mated with my shambling king, ye twain had fallen out about the bride of one—his name is out of me—the prize, if prize she were—(what marvel—she could see)— thine, friend; and ever since my craven seeks to wreck thee villainously: but, o sir knight, what dame or damsel have ye kneel'd to last?"" and tristram, ""last to my queen paramount, here now to my queen paramount of love and loveliness—ay, lovelier than when first her light feet fell on our rough lyonnesse, sailing from ireland."" softly laugh'd isolt; ""flatter me not, for hath not our great queen my dole of beauty trebled?"" and he said, ""her beauty is her beauty, and thine thine, and thine is more to me—soft, gracious, kind— save when thy mark is kindled on thy lips most gracious; but she, haughty ev'n to him, lancelot; for i have seen him wan enow to make one doubt if ever the great queen have yielded him her love."" to whom isolt, ""ah then, false hunter and false harper, thou who brakest thro' the scruple of my bond, calling me thy white hind, and saying to me that guinevere had sinn'd against the highest, and i—misyoked with such a want of man— that i could hardly sin against the lowest."" he answer'd, ""o my soul, be comforted! if this be sweet, to sin in leading-strings, if here be comfort, and if ours be sin, crown'd warrant had we for the crowning sin that made us happy: but how ye greet me—fear and fault and doubt—no word of that fond tale— thy deep heart-yearnings, thy sweet memories of tristram in that year he was away."" and, saddening on the sudden, spake isolt, ""i had forgotten all in my strong joy to see thee—yearnings?—ay! for, hour by hour, here in the never-ended afternoon, o sweeter than all memories of thee, deeper than any yearnings after thee seem'd those far-rolling, westward-smiling seas, watch'd from this tower. isolt of britain dash'd before isolt of brittany on the strand, would that have chill'd her bride-kiss? wedded her? fought in her father's battles? wounded there? the king was all fulfill'd with gratefulness, and she, my namesake of the hands, that heal'd thy hurt and heart with unguent and caress— well—can i wish her any huger wrong than having known thee? her too hast thou left to pine and waste in those sweet memories. o were i not my mark's, by whom all men are noble, i should hate thee more than love."" and tristram, fondling her light hands, replied, ""grace, queen, for being loved: she loved me well. did i love her? the name at least i loved. isolt?—i fought his battles, for isolt! the night was dark; the true star set. isolt! the name was ruler of the dark—isolt? care not for her! patient, and prayerful, meek, pale-blooded, she will yield herself to god."" and isolt answer'd, ""yea, and why not i? mine is the larger need, who am not meek, pale-blooded, prayerful. let me tell thee now. here one black, mute midsummer night i sat, lonely, but musing on thee, wondering where, murmuring a light song i had heard thee sing, and once or twice i spake thy name aloud. then flash'd a levin-brand; and near me stood, in fuming sulphur blue and green, a fiend— mark's way to steal behind one in the dark— for there was mark: 'he has wedded her,' he said, not said, but hiss'd it: then this crown of towers so shook to such a roar of all the sky, that here in utter dark i swoon'd away, and woke again in utter dark, and cried, 'i will flee hence and give myself to god'— and thou wert lying in thy new leman's arms."" then tristram, ever dallying with her hand, ""may god be with thee, sweet, when old and gray, and past desire!"" a saying that anger'd her. ""'may god be with thee, sweet, when thou art old, and sweet no more to me!' i need him now. for when had lancelot utter'd aught so gross ev'n to the swineherd's malkin in the mast? the greater man, the greater courtesy. far other was the tristram, arthur's knight! but thou, thro' ever harrying thy wild beasts— save that to touch a harp, tilt with a lance becomes thee well—art grown wild beast thyself. how darest thou, if lover, push me even in fancy from thy side, and set me far in the gray distance, half a life away, her to be loved no more? unsay it, unswear! flatter me rather, seeing me so weak, broken with mark and hate and solitude, thy marriage and mine own, that i should suck lies like sweet wines: lie to me: i believe. will ye not lie? not swear, as there ye kneel, and solemnly as when ye sware to him, the man of men, our king—my god, the power was once in vows when men believed the king! they lied not then, who sware, and thro' their vows the king prevailing made his realm:—i say, swear to me thou wilt love me ev'n when old, gray-hair'd, and past desire, and in despair."" then tristram, pacing moodily up and down, ""vows! did you keep the vow you made to mark more than i mine? lied, say ye? nay, but learnt, the vow that binds too strictly snaps itself— my knighthood taught me this—ay, being snapt— we run more counter to the soul thereof than had we never sworn. i swear no more. i swore to the great king, and am forsworn. for once—ev'n to the height—i honour'd him. 'man, is he man at all?' methought, when first i rode from our rough lyonnesse, and beheld that victor of the pagan throned in hall— his hair, a sun that ray'd from off a brow like hillsnow high in heaven, the steel-blue eyes, the golden beard that clothed his lips with light— moreover, that weird legend of his birth, with merlin's mystic babble about his end amazed me; then his foot was on a stool shaped as a dragon; he seem'd to me no man, but michaël trampling satan; so i sware, being amazed: but this went by—the vows! o ay—the wholesome madness of an hour— they served their use, their time; for every knight believed himself a greater than himself, and every follower eyed him as a god; till he, being lifted up beyond himself, did mightier deeds than elsewise he had done, and so the realm was made; but then their vows— first mainly thro' that sullying of our queen— began to gall the knighthood, asking whence had arthur right to bind them to himself? dropt down from heaven? wash'd up from out the deep? they fail'd to trace him thro' the flesh and blood of our old kings: whence then? a doubtful lord to bind them by inviolable vows, which flesh and blood perforce would violate: for feel this arm of mine—the tide within red with free chase and heather-scented air, pulsing full man; can arthur make me pure as any maiden child? lock up my tongue from uttering freely what i freely hear? bind me to one? the wide world laughs at it. and worldling of the world am i, and know the ptarmigan that whitens ere his hour woos his own end; we are not angels here nor shall be: vows—i am woodman of the woods, and hear the garnet-headed yaffingale mock them: my soul, we love but while we may; and therefore is my love so large for thee, seeing it is not bounded save by love."" here ending, he moved toward her, and she said, ""good: an i turn'd away my love for thee to some one thrice as courteous as thyself— for courtesy wins woman all as well as valour may, but he that closes both is perfect, he is lancelot—taller indeed, rosier and comelier, thou—but say i loved this knightliest of all knights, and cast thee back thine own small saw, 'we love but while we may,' well then, what answer?"" he that while she spake, mindful of what he brought to adorn her with, the jewels, had let one finger lightly touch the warm white apple of her throat, replied, ""press this a little closer, sweet, until— come, i am hunger'd and half-anger'd—meat, wine, wine—and i will love thee to the death, and out beyond into the dream to come."" so then, when both were brought to full accord, she rose, and set before him all he will'd; and after these had comforted the blood with meats and wines, and satiated their hearts— now talking of their woodland paradise, the deer, the dews, the fern, the founts, the lawns; now mocking at the much ungainliness, and craven shifts, and long crane legs of mark— then tristram laughing caught the harp, and sang: ""ay, ay, o ay—the winds that bend the brier! a star in heaven, a star within the mere! ay, ay, o ay—a star was my desire, and one was far apart, and one was near: ay, ay, o ay—the winds that bow the grass! and one was water and one star was fire, and one will ever shine and one will pass. ay, ay, o ay—the winds that move the mere."" then in the light's last glimmer tristram show'd and swung the ruby carcanet. she cried, ""the collar of some order, which our king hath newly founded, all for thee, my soul, for thee, to yield thee grace beyond thy peers."" ""not so, my queen,"" he said, ""but the red fruit grown on a magic oak-tree in mid-heaven, and won by tristram as a tourney-prize, and hither brought by tristram for his last love-offering and peace-offering unto thee."" he spoke, he turn'd, then, flinging round her neck, claspt it, and cried ""thine order, o my queen!"" but, while he bow'd to kiss the jewell'd throat, out of the dark, just as the lips had touch'd, behind him rose a shadow and a shriek— ""mark's way,"" said mark, and clove him thro' the brain. that night came arthur home, and while he climb'd, all in a death-dumb autumn-dripping gloom, the stairway to the hall, and look'd and saw the great queen's bower was dark,—about his feet a voice clung sobbing till he question'd it, ""what art thou?"" and the voice about his feet sent up an answer, sobbing, ""i am thy fool, and i shall never make thee smile again."" <line>","love,desire,realistic & complicated,relationships,mythology & folklore,fairy-tales & legends,heroes & patriotism"

<line> <line>something they never tell. <line> <line>you remember too much, <line> <line>my mother said to me recently. <line> <line>why hold onto all that? and i said, <line> <line>where can i put it down? <line> <line>she shifted to a question about airports. <line> <line>crops of ice are changing to mud all around me <line> <line>as i push on across the moor <line> <line>warmed by drifts from the pale blue sun. <line> <line>on the edge of the moor our pines <line> <line>dip and coast in breezes <line> <line>from somewhere else. <line> <line>perhaps the hardest thing about losing a lover is <line> <line>to watch the year repeat its days. <line> <line>it is as if i could dip my hand down <line> <line>into time and scoop up <line> <line>blue and green lozenges of april heat <line> <line>a year ago in another country. <line> <line>i can feel that other day running underneath this one <line> <line>like an old videotape—here we go fast around the last corner <line> <line>up the hill to his house, shadows <line> <line>of limes and roses blowing in the car window <line> <line>and music spraying from the radio and him <line> <line>singing and touching my left hand to his lips. <line> <line>law lived in a high blue room from which he could see the sea. <line> <line>time in its transparent loops as it passes beneath me now <line> <line>still carries the sound of the telephone in that room <line> <line>and traffic far off and doves under the window <line> <line>chuckling coolly and his voice saying, <line> <line>you beauty. i can feel that beauty’s <line> <line>heart beating inside mine as she presses into his arms in the high blue room— <line> <line>no, i say aloud. i force my arms down <line> <line>through air which is suddenly cold and heavy as water <line> <line>and the videotape jerks to a halt <line> <line>like a glass slide under a drop of blood. <line> <line>i stop and turn and stand into the wind, <line> <line>which now plunges towards me over the moor. <line> <line>when law left i felt so bad i thought i would die. <line> <line>this is not uncommon. <line> <line>i took up the practice of meditation. <line> <line>each morning i sat on the floor in front of my sofa <line> <line>and chanted bits of old latin prayers.de profundis clamavi ad te domine. <line> <line>each morning a vision came to me. <line> <line>gradually i understood that these were naked glimpses of my soul. <line> <line>i called them nudes. <line> <line>nude #1. woman alone on a hill. <line> <line>she stands into the wind. <line> <line>it is a hard wind slanting from the north. <line> <line>long flaps and shreds of flesh rip off the woman’s body and lift <line> <line>and blow away on the wind, leaving <line> <line>an exposed column of nerve and blood and muscle <line> <line>calling mutely through lipless mouth. <line> <line>it pains me to record this, <line> <line>i am not a melodramatic person. <line> <line>but soul is “hewn in a wild workshop” <line> <line>as charlotte brontë says of wuthering heights. <line> <line>charlotte’s preface to wuthering heights is a publicist’s masterpiece. <line> <line>like someone carefully not looking at a scorpion <line> <line>crouched on the arm of the sofa charlotte <line> <line>talks firmly and calmly <line> <line>about the other furniture of emily’s workshop—about <line> <line>the inexorable spirit (“stronger than a man, simpler than a child”), <line> <line>the cruel illness (“pain no words can render”), <line> <line>the autonomous end (“she sank rapidly, she made haste to leave us”) <line> <line>and about emily’s total subjection <line> <line>to a creative project she could neither understand nor control, <line> <line>and for which she deserves no more praise nor blame <line> <line>than if she had opened her mouth <line> <line>“to breathe lightning.” the scorpion is inching down <line> <line>the arm of the sofa while charlotte <line> <line>continues to speak helpfully about lightning <line> <line>and other weather we may expect to experience <line> <line>when we enter emily’s electrical atmosphere. <line> <line>it is “a horror of great darkness” that awaits us there <line> <line>but emily is not responsible. emily was in the grip. <line> <line>“having formed these beings she did not know what she had done,” <line> <line>says charlotte (of heathcliff and earnshaw and catherine). <line> <line>well there are many ways of being held prisoner. <line> <line>the scorpion takes a light spring and lands on our left knee <line> <line>as charlotte concludes, “on herself she had no pity.” <line> <line>pitiless too are the heights, which emily called wuthering <line> <line>because of their “bracing ventilation” <line> <line>and “a north wind over the edge.” <line> <line>whaching a north wind grind the moor <line> <line>that surrounded her father’s house on every side, <line> <line>formed of a kind of rock called millstone grit, <line> <line>taught emily all she knew about love and its necessities— <line> <line>an angry education that shapes the way her characters <line> <line>use one another. “my love for heathcliff,” says catherine, <line> <line>“resembles the eternal rocks beneath <line> <line>a source of little visible delight, but necessary.” <line> <line>necessary? i notice the sun has dimmed <line> <line>and the afternoon air sharpening. <line> <line>i turn and start to recross the moor towards home. <line> <line>what are the imperatives <line> <line>that hold people like catherine and heathcliff <line> <line>together and apart, like pores blown into hot rock <line> <line>and then stranded out of reach <line> <line>of one another when it hardens? what kind of necessity is that? <line> <line>the last time i saw law was a black night in september. <line> <line>autumn had begun, <line> <line>my knees were cold inside my clothes. <line> <line>a chill fragment of moon rose. <line> <line>he stood in my living room and spoke <line> <line>without looking at me. not enough spin on it, <line> <line>he said of our five years of love. <line> <line>inside my chest i felt my heart snap into two pieces <line> <line>which floated apart. by now i was so cold <line> <line>it was like burning. i put out my hand <line> <line>to touch his. he moved back. <line> <line>i don’t want to be sexual with you, he said. everything gets crazy. <line> <line>but now he was looking at me. <line> <line>yes, i said as i began to remove my clothes. <line> <line>everything gets crazy. when nude <line> <line>i turned my back because he likes the back. <line> <line>he moved onto me. <line> <line>everything i know about love and its necessities <line> <line>i learned in that one moment <line> <line>when i found myself <line> <line>thrusting my little burning red backside like a baboon <line> <line>at a man who no longer cherished me. <line> <line>there was no area of my mind <line> <line>not appalled by this action, no part of my body <line> <line>that could have done otherwise. <line> <line>but to talk of mind and body begs the question. <line> <line>soul is the place, <line> <line>stretched like a surface of millstone grit between body and mind, <line> <line>where such necessity grinds itself out. <line> <line>soul is what i kept watch on all that night. <line> <line>law stayed with me. <line> <line>we lay on top of the covers as if it weren’t really a night of sleep and time, <line> <line>caressing and singing to one another in our made-up language <line> <line>like the children we used to be. <line> <line>that was a night that centred heaven and hell, <line> <line>as emily would say. we tried to fuck <line> <line>but he remained limp, although happy. i came <line> <line>again and again, each time accumulating lucidity, <line> <line>until at last i was floating high up near the ceiling looking down <line> <line>on the two souls clasped there on the bed <line> <line>with their mortal boundaries <line> <line>visible around them like lines on a map. <line> <line>i saw the lines harden. <line> <line>he left in the morning. <line> <line>it is very cold <line> <line>walking into the long scraped april wind. <line> <line>at this time of year there is no sunset <line> <line>just some movements inside the light and then a sinking away. <line> <line>kitchen <line> <line>kitchen is quiet as a bone when i come in. <line> <line>no sound from the rest of the house. <line> <line>i wait a moment <line> <line>then open the fridge. <line> <line>brilliant as a spaceship it exhales cold confusion. <line> <line>my mother lives alone and eats little but her fridge is always crammed. <line> <line>after extracting the yogurt container <line> <line>from beneath a wily arrangement of leftover blocks of christmas cake <line> <line>wrapped in foil and prescription medicine bottles <line> <line>i close the fridge door. bluish dusk <line> <line>fills the room like a sea slid back. <line> <line>i lean against the sink. <line> <line>white foods taste best to me <line> <line>and i prefer to eat alone. i don’t know why. <line> <line>once i heard girls singing a may day song that went: <line> <line> violante in the pantry <line> <line> gnawing at a mutton bone <line> <line> how she gnawed it <line> <line> how she clawed it <line> <line> when she felt herself alone. <line> <line>girls are cruelest to themselves. <line> <line>someone like emily brontë, <line> <line>who remained a girl all her life despite her body as a woman, <line> <line>had cruelty drifted up in all the cracks of her like spring snow. <line> <line>we can see her ridding herself of it at various times <line> <line>with a gesture like she used to brush the carpet. <line> <line>reason with him and then whip him! <line> <line>was her instruction (age six) to her father <line> <line>regarding brother branwell. <line> <line>and when she was 14 and bitten by a rabid dog she strode (they say) <line> <line>into the kitchen and taking red hot tongs from the back of the stove applied <line> <line>them directly to her arm. <line> <line>cauterization of heathcliff took longer. <line> <line>more than thirty years in the time of the novel, <line> <line>from the april evening when he runs out the back door of the kitchen <line> <line>and vanishes over the moor <line> <line>because he overheard half a sentence of catherine’s <line> <line>(“it would degrade me to marry heathcliff”) <line> <line>until the wild morning <line> <line>when the servant finds him stark dead and grinning <line> <line>on his rainsoaked bed upstairs in wuthering heights. <line> <line>heathcliff is a pain devil. <line> <line>if he had stayed in the kitchen <line> <line>long enough to hear the other half of catherine’s sentence <line> <line>(“so he will never know how i love him”) <line> <line>heathcliff would have been set free. <line> <line>but emily knew how to catch a devil. <line> <line>she put into him in place of a soul <line> <line>the constant cold departure of catherine from his nervous system <line> <line>every time he drew a breath or moved thought. <line> <line>she broke all his moments in half, <line> <line>with the kitchen door standing open. <line> <line>i am not unfamiliar with this half-life. <line> <line>but there is more to it than that. <line> <line>heathcliff’s sexual despair <line> <line>arose out of no such experience in the life of emily brontë, <line> <line>so far as we know. her question, <line> <line>which concerns the years of inner cruelty that can twist a person into a pain <line> <line> devil, <line> <line>came to her in a kindly firelit kitchen <line> <line>(“kichin” in emily’s spelling) where she <line> <line>and charlotte and anne peeled potatoes together <line> <line>and made up stories with the old house dog keeper at their feet. <line> <line>there is a fragment <line> <line>of a poem she wrote in 1839 <line> <line>(about six years before wuthering heights) that says: <line> <line> that iron man was born like me <line> <line> and he was once an ardent boy: <line> <line> he must have felt in infancy <line> <line> the glory of a summer sky. <line> <line>who is the iron man? <line> <line>my mother’s voice cuts across me, <line> <line>from the next room where she is lying on the sofa. <line> <line>is that you dear? <line> <line>yes ma. <line> <line>why don’t you turn on a light in there? <line> <line>out the kitchen window i watch the steely april sun <line> <line>jab its last cold yellow streaks <line> <line>across a dirty silver sky. <line> <line>okay ma. what’s for supper? <line> <line>liberty <line> <line>liberty means different things to different people. <line> <line>i have never liked lying in bed in the morning. <line> <line>law did. <line> <line>my mother does. <line> <line>but as soon as the morning light hits my eyes i want to be out in it— <line> <line>moving along the moor <line> <line>into the first blue currents and cold navigation of everything awake. <line> <line>i hear my mother in the next room turn and sigh and sink deeper. <line> <line>i peel the stale cage of sheets off my legs <line> <line>and i am free. <line> <line>out on the moor all is brilliant and hard after a night of frost. <line> <line>the light plunges straight up from the ice to a blue hole at the top of the sky. <line> <line>frozen mud crunches underfoot. the sound <line> <line>startles me back into the dream i was having <line> <line>this morning when i awoke, <line> <line>one of those nightlong sweet dreams of lying in law’s <line> <line>arms like a needle in water—it is a physical effort <line> <line>to pull myself out of his white silk hands <line> <line>as they slide down my dream hips—i <line> <line>turn and face into the wind <line> <line>and begin to run. <line> <line>goblins, devils and death stream behind me. <line> <line>in the days and months after law left <line> <line>i felt as if the sky was torn off my life. <line> <line>i had no home in goodness anymore. <line> <line>to see the love between law and me <line> <line>turn into two animals gnawing and craving through one another <line> <line>towards some other hunger was terrible. <line> <line>perhaps this is what people mean by original sin, i thought. <line> <line>but what love could be prior to it? <line> <line>what is prior? <line> <line>what is love? <line> <line>my questions were not original. <line> <line>nor did i answer them. <line> <line>mornings when i meditated <line> <line>i was presented with a nude glimpse of my lone soul, <line> <line>not the complex mysteries of love and hate. <line> <line>but the nudes are still as clear in my mind <line> <line>as pieces of laundry that froze on the clothesline overnight. <line> <line>there were in all thirteen of them. <line> <line>nude #2. woman caught in a cage of thorns. <line> <line>big glistening brown thorns with black stains on them <line> <line>where she twists this way and that way <line> <line>unable to stand upright. <line> <line>nude #3. woman with a single great thorn implanted in her forehead. <line> <line>she grips it in both hands <line> <line>endeavouring to wrench it out. <line> <line>nude #4. woman on a blasted landscape <line> <line>backlit in red like hieronymus bosch. <line> <line>covering her head and upper body is a hellish contraption <line> <line>like the top half of a crab. <line> <line>with arms crossed as if pulling off a sweater <line> <line>she works hard at dislodging the crab. <line> <line>it was about this time <line> <line>i began telling dr. haw <line> <line>about the nudes. she said, <line> <line>when you see these horrible images why do you stay with them? <line> <line>why keep watching? why not <line> <line>go away? i was amazed. <line> <line>go away where? i said. <line> <line>this still seems to me a good question. <line> <line>but by now the day is wide open and a strange young april light <line> <line>is filling the moor with gold milk. <line> <line>i have reached the middle <line> <line>where the ground goes down into a depression and fills with swampy water. <line> <line>it is frozen. <line> <line>a solid black pane of moor life caught in its own night attitudes. <line> <line>certain wild gold arrangements of weed are visible deep in the black. <line> <line>four naked alder trunks rise straight up from it <line> <line>and sway in the blue air. each trunk <line> <line>where it enters the ice radiates a map of silver pressures— <line> <line>thousands of hair-thin cracks catching the white of the light <line> <line>like a jailed face <line> <line>catching grins through the bars. <line> <line>emily brontë has a poem about a woman in jail who says <line> <line> a messenger of hope, comes every night to me <line> <line> and offers, for short life, eternal liberty. <line> <line>i wonder what kind of liberty this is. <line> <line>her critics and commentators say she means death <line> <line>or a visionary experience that prefigures death. <line> <line>they understand her prison <line> <line>as the limitations placed on a clergyman’s daughter <line> <line>by nineteenth-century life in a remote parish on a cold moor <line> <line>in the north of england. <line> <line>they grow impatient with the extreme terms in which she figures prison life. <line> <line>“in so much of brontë’s work <line> <line>the self-dramatising and posturing of these poems teeters <line> <line>on the brink of a potentially bathetic melodrama,” <line> <line>says one. another <line> <line>refers to “the cardboard sublime” of her caught world. <line> <line>i stopped telling my psychotherapist about the nudes <line> <line>when i realized i had no way to answer her question, <line> <line>why keep watching? <line> <line>some people watch, that’s all i can say. <line> <line>there is nowhere else to go, <line> <line>no ledge to climb up to. <line> <line>perhaps i can explain this to her if i wait for the right moment, <line> <line>as with a very difficult sister. <line> <line>“on that mind time and experience alone could work: <line> <line>to the influence of other intellects it was not amenable,” <line> <line>wrote charlotte of emily. <line> <line>i wonder what kind of conversation these two had <line> <line>over breakfast at the parsonage. <line> <line>“my sister emily <line> <line>was not a person of demonstrative character,” charlotte emphasizes, <line> <line>“nor one on the recesses of whose mind and feelings, <line> <line>even those nearest and dearest to her could, <line> <line>with impunity, intrude unlicensed. . . .” recesses were many. <line> <line>one autumn day in 1845 charlotte <line> <line>“accidentally lighted on a ms. volume of verse in my sister emily’s <line> <line> handwriting.” <line> <line>it was a small (4 x 6) notebook <line> <line>with a dark red cover marked 6d. <line> <line>and contained 44 poems in emily’s minute hand. <line> <line>charlotte had known emily wrote verse <line> <line>but felt “more than surprise” at its quality. <line> <line>“not at all like the poetry women generally write.” <line> <line>further surprise awaited charlotte when she read emily’s novel, <line> <line>not least for its foul language. <line> <line>she gently probes this recess <line> <line>in her editor’s preface to wuthering heights. <line> <line>“a large class of readers, likewise, will suffer greatly <line> <line>from the introduction into the pages of this work <line> <line>of words printed with all their letters, <line> <line>which it has become the custom to represent by the initial and final letter <line> <line> only—a blank <line> <line>line filling the interval.” <line> <line>well, there are different definitions of liberty. <line> <line>love is freedom, law was fond of saying. <line> <line>i took this to be more a wish than a thought <line> <line>and changed the subject. <line> <line>but blank lines do not say nothing. <line> <line>as charlotte puts it, <line> <line>“the practice of hinting by single letters those expletives <line> <line>with which profane and violent persons are wont to garnish their discourse, <line> <line>strikes me as a proceeding which, <line> <line>however well meant, is weak and futile. <line> <line>i cannot tell what good it does—what feeling it spares— <line> <line>what horror it conceals.” <line> <line>i turn my steps and begin walking back over the moor <line> <line>towards home and breakfast. it is a two-way traffic, <line> <line>the language of the unsaid. my favourite pages <line> <line>of the collected works of emily brontë <line> <line>are the notes at the back <line> <line>recording small adjustments made by charlotte <line> <line>to the text of emily’s verse, <line> <line>which charlotte edited for publication after emily’s death. <line> <line>“prison for strongest [in emily’s hand] altered to lordly by charlotte.” <line> <line>hero <line> <line>i can tell by the way my mother chews her toast <line> <line>whether she had a good night <line> <line>and is about to say a happy thing <line> <line>or not. <line> <line>not. <line> <line>she puts her toast down on the side of her plate. <line> <line>you know you can pull the drapes in that room, she begins. <line> <line>this is a coded reference to one of our oldest arguments, <line> <line>from what i call the rules of life series. <line> <line>my mother always closes her bedroom drapes tight before going to bed at night. <line> <line>i open mine as wide as possible. <line> <line>i like to see everything, i say. <line> <line>what’s there to see? <line> <line>moon. air. sunrise. <line> <line>all that light on your face in the morning. wakes you up. <line> <line>i like to wake up. <line> <line>at this point the drapes argument has reached a delta <line> <line>and may advance along one of three channels. <line> <line>there is the what you need is a good night’s sleep channel, <line> <line>the stubborn as your father channel <line> <line>and random channel. <line> <line>more toast? i interpose strongly, pushing back my chair. <line> <line>those women! says my mother with an exasperated rasp. <line> <line>mother has chosen random channel. <line> <line>women? <line> <line>complaining about rape all the time <line> <line>i see she is tapping one furious finger on yesterday’s newspaper <line> <line>lying beside the grape jam. <line> <line>the front page has a small feature <line> <line>about a rally for international women’s day— <line> <line>have you had a look at the sears summer catalogue? <line> <line>nope. <line> <line>why, it’s a disgrace! those bathing suits— <line> <line>cut way up to here! (she points) no wonder! <line> <line>you’re saying women deserve to get raped <line> <line>because sears bathing suit ads <line> <line>have high-cut legs? ma, are you serious? <line> <line>well someone has to be responsible. <line> <line>why should women be responsible for male desire? my voice is high. <line> <line>oh i see you’re one of them. <line> <line>one of whom? my voice is very high. mother vaults it. <line> <line>and whatever did you do with that little tank suit you had last year the green <line> <line> one? <line> <line>it looked so smart on you. <line> <line>the frail fact drops on me from a great height <line> <line>that my mother is afraid. <line> <line>she will be eighty years old this summer. <line> <line>her tiny sharp shoulders hunched in the blue bathrobe <line> <line>make me think of emily brontë’s little merlin hawk hero <line> <line>that she fed bits of bacon at the kitchen table when charlotte wasn‘t around. <line> <line>so ma, we’ll go—i pop up the toaster <line> <line>and toss a hot slice of pumpernickel lightly across onto her plate— <line> <line>visit dad today? she eyes the kitchen clock with hostility. <line> <line>leave at eleven, home again by four? i continue. <line> <line>she is buttering her toast with jagged strokes. <line> <line>silence is assent in our code. i go into the next room to phone the taxi. <line> <line>my father lives in a hospital for patients who need chronic care <line> <line>about 50 miles from here. <line> <line>he suffers from a kind of dementia <line> <line>characterized by two sorts of pathological change <line> <line>first recorded in 1907 by alois alzheimer. <line> <line>first, the presence in cerebral tissue <line> <line>of a spherical formation known as neuritic plaque, <line> <line>consisting mainly of degenerating brain cells. <line> <line>second, neurofibrillary snarlings <line> <line>in the cerebral cortex and in the hippocampus. <line> <line>there is no known cause or cure. <line> <line>mother visits him by taxi once a week <line> <line>for the last five years. <line> <line>marriage is for better or for worse, she says, <line> <line>this is the worse. <line> <line>so about an hour later we are in the taxi <line> <line>shooting along empty country roads towards town. <line> <line>the april light is clear as an alarm. <line> <line>as we pass them it gives a sudden sense of every object <line> <line>existing in space on its own shadow. <line> <line>i wish i could carry this clarity with me <line> <line>into the hospital where distinctions tend to flatten and coalesce. <line> <line>i wish i had been nicer to him before he got crazy. <line> <line>these are my two wishes. <line> <line>it is hard to find the beginning of dementia. <line> <line>i remember a night about ten years ago <line> <line>when i was talking to him on the telephone. <line> <line>it was a sunday night in winter. <line> <line>i heard his sentences filling up with fear. <line> <line>he would start a sentence—about weather, lose his way, start another. <line> <line>it made me furious to hear him floundering— <line> <line>my tall proud father, former world war ii navigator! <line> <line>it made me merciless. <line> <line>i stood on the edge of the conversation, <line> <line>watching him thrash about for cues, <line> <line>offering none, <line> <line>and it came to me like a slow avalanche <line> <line>that he had no idea who he was talking to. <line> <line>much colder today i guess. . . . <line> <line>his voice pressed into the silence and broke off, <line> <line>snow falling on it. <line> <line>there was a long pause while snow covered us both. <line> <line>well i won’t keep you, <line> <line>he said with sudden desperate cheer as if sighting land. <line> <line>i’ll say goodnight now, <line> <line>i won’t run up your bill. goodbye. <line> <line>goodbye. <line> <line>goodbye. who are you? <line> <line>i said into the dial tone. <line> <line>at the hospital we pass down long pink halls <line> <line>through a door with a big window <line> <line>and a combination lock (5—25—3) <line> <line>to the west wing, for chronic care patients. <line> <line>each wing has a name. <line> <line>the chronic wing is our golden mile <line> <line>although mother prefers to call it the last lap. <line> <line>father sits strapped in a chair which is tied to the wall <line> <line>in a room of other tied people tilting at various angles. <line> <line>my father tilts least, i am proud of him. <line> <line>hi dad how y’doing? <line> <line>his face cracks open it could be a grin or rage <line> <line>and looking past me he issues a stream of vehemence at the air. <line> <line>my mother lays her hand on his. <line> <line>hello love, she says. he jerks his hand away. we sit. <line> <line>sunlight flocks through the room. <line> <line>mother begins to unpack from her handbag the things she has brought for him, <line> <line>grapes, arrowroot biscuits, humbugs. <line> <line>he is addressing strenuous remarks to someone in the air between us. <line> <line>he uses a language known only to himself, <line> <line>made of snarls and syllables and sudden wild appeals. <line> <line>once in a while some old formula floats up through the wash— <line> <line>you don’t say! or happy birthday to you!— <line> <line>but no real sentence <line> <line>for more than three years now. <line> <line>i notice his front teeth are getting black. <line> <line>i wonder how you clean the teeth of mad people. <line> <line>he always took good care of his teeth. my mother looks up. <line> <line>she and i often think two halves of one thought. <line> <line>do you remember that gold-plated toothpick <line> <line>you sent him from harrod’s the summer you were in london? she asks. <line> <line>yes i wonder what happened to it. <line> <line>must be in the bathroom somewhere. <line> <line>she is giving him grapes one by one. <line> <line>they keep rolling out of his huge stiff fingers. <line> <line>he used to be a big man, over six feet tall and strong, <line> <line>but since he came to hospital his body has shrunk to the merest bone house— <line> <line>except the hands. the hands keep growing. <line> <line>each one now as big as a boot in van gogh, <line> <line>they go lumbering after the grapes in his lap. <line> <line>but now he turns to me with a rush of urgent syllables <line> <line>that break off on a high note—he waits, <line> <line>staring into my face. that quizzical look. <line> <line>one eyebrow at an angle. <line> <line>i have a photograph taped to my fridge at home. <line> <line>it shows his world war ii air crew posing in front of the plane. <line> <line>hands firmly behind backs, legs wide apart, <line> <line>chins forward. <line> <line>dressed in the puffed flying suits <line> <line>with a wide leather strap pulled tight through the crotch. <line> <line>they squint into the brilliant winter sun of 1942. <line> <line>it is dawn. <line> <line>they are leaving dover for france. <line> <line>my father on the far left is the tallest airman, <line> <line>with his collar up, <line> <line>one eyebrow at an angle. <line> <line>the shadowless light makes him look immortal, <line> <line>for all the world like someone who will not weep again. <line> <line>he is still staring into my face. <line> <line>flaps down! i cry. <line> <line>his black grin flares once and goes out like a match. <line> <line>hot <line> <line>hot blue moonlight down the steep sky. <line> <line>i wake too fast from a cellar of hanged puppies <line> <line>with my eyes pouring into the dark. <line> <line>fumbling <line> <line>and slowly <line> <line>consciousness replaces the bars. <line> <line>dreamtails and angry liquids <line> <line>swim back down to the middle of me. <line> <line>it is generally anger dreams that occupy my nights now. <line> <line>this is not uncommon after loss of love— <line> <line>blue and black and red blasting the crater open. <line> <line>i am interested in anger. <line> <line>i clamber along to find the source. <line> <line>my dream was of an old woman lying awake in bed. <line> <line>she controls the house by a system of light bulbs strung above her on wires. <line> <line>each wire has a little black switch. <line> <line>one by one the switches refuse to turn the bulbs on. <line> <line>she keeps switching and switching <line> <line>in rising tides of very hot anger. <line> <line>then she creeps out of bed to peer through lattices <line> <line>at the rooms of the rest of the house. <line> <line>the rooms are silent and brilliantly lit <line> <line>and full of huge furniture beneath which crouch <line> <line>small creatures—not quite cats not quite rats <line> <line>licking their narrow red jaws <line> <line>under a load of time. <line> <line>i want to be beautiful again, she whispers <line> <line>but the great overlit rooms tick emptily <line> <line>as a deserted oceanliner and now behind her in the dark <line> <line>a rustling sound, comes— <line> <line>my pajamas are soaked. <line> <line>anger travels through me, pushes aside everything else in my heart, <line> <line>pouring up the vents. <line> <line>every night i wake to this anger, <line> <line>the soaked bed, <line> <line>the hot pain box slamming me each way i move. <line> <line>i want justice. slam. <line> <line>i want an explanation. slam. <line> <line>i want to curse the false friend who said i love you forever. slam. <line> <line>i reach up and switch on the bedside lamp. night springs <line> <line>out the window and is gone over the moor. <line> <line>i lie listening to the light vibrate in my ears <line> <line>and thinking about curses. <line> <line>emily brontë was good at cursing. <line> <line>falsity and bad love and the deadly pain of alteration are constant topics in <line> <line> her verse. <line> <line> well, thou halt paid me back my love! <line> <line> but if there be a god above <line> <line> whose arm is strong, whose word is true, <line> <line> this hell shall wring thy spirit too! <line> <line>the curses are elaborate: <line> <line> there go, deceiver, go! my hand is streaming wet; <line> <line> my heart’s blood flows to buy the blessing—to forget! <line> <line> oh could that lost heart give back, back again to thine, <line> <line> one tenth part of the pain that clouds my dark decline! <line> <line>but they do not bring her peace: <line> <line> vain words, vain frenzied thoughts! no ear can hear me call— <line> <line> lost in the vacant air my frantic curses fall. . . . <line> <line> unconquered in my soul the tyrant rules me still— <line> <line> life bows to my control, but love i cannot kill! <line> <line>her anger is a puzzle. <line> <line>it raises many questions in me, <line> <line>to see love treated with such cold and knowing contempt <line> <line>by someone who rarely left home <line> <line>“except to go to church or take a walk on the hills” <line> <line>(charlotte tells us) and who <line> <line>had no more intercourse with haworth folk <line> <line>than “a nun has <line> <line>of the country people who sometimes pass her convent gates.” <line> <line>how did emily come to lose faith in humans? <line> <line>she admired their dialects, studied their genealogies, <line> <line>“but with them she rarely exchanged a word.” <line> <line>her introvert nature shrank from shaking hands with someone she met on the moor. <line> <line>what did emily know of lover’s lies or cursive human faith? <line> <line>among her biographers <line> <line>is one who conjectures she bore or aborted a child <line> <line>during her six-month stay in halifax, <line> <line>but there is no evidence at all for such an event <line> <line>and the more general consensus is that emily did not touch a man in her 31 <line> <line> years. <line> <line>banal sexism aside, <line> <line>i find myself tempted <line> <line>to read wuthering heights as one thick stacked act of revenge <line> <line>for all that life withheld from emily. <line> <line>but the poetry shows traces of a deeper explanation. <line> <line>as if anger could be a kind of vocation for some women. <line> <line>it is a chilly thought. <line> <line> <line> <line> the heart is dead since infancy. <line> <line> unwept for let the body go. <line> <line>suddenly cold i reach down and pull the blanket back up to my chin. <line> <line>the vocation of anger is not mine. <line> <line>i know my source. <line> <line>it is stunning, it is a moment like no other, <line> <line>when one’s lover comes in and says i do not love you anymore. <line> <line>i switch off the lamp and lie on my back, <line> <line>thinking about emily’s cold young soul. <line> <line>where does unbelief begin? <line> <line>when i was young <line> <line>there were degrees of certainty. <line> <line>i could say, yes i know that i have two hands. <line> <line>then one day i awakened on a planet of people whose hands occasionally <line> <line> disappear— <line> <line>from the next room i hear my mother shift and sigh and settle <line> <line>back down under the doorsill of sleep. <line> <line>out the window the moon is just a cold bit of silver gristle low on fading banks <line> <line> of sky. <line> <line> our guests are darkly lodged, i whispered, gazing through <line> <line> the vault . . . <line> <line>thou <line> <line>the question i am left with is the question of her loneliness. <line> <line>and i prefer to put it off. <line> <line>it is morning. <line> <line>astonished light is washing over the moor from north to east. <line> <line>i am walking into the light. <line> <line>one way to put off loneliness is to interpose god. <line> <line>emily had a relationship on this level with someone she calls thou. she describes thou as awake like herself all night <line> <line>and full of strange power. <line> <line>thou woos emily with a voice that comes out of the night wind. <line> <line>thou and emily influence one another in the darkness, <line> <line>playing near and far at once. <line> <line>she talks about a sweetness that “proved us one.” <line> <line>i am uneasy with the compensatory model of female religious experience and yet, <line> <line>there is no question, <line> <line>it would be sweet to have a friend to tell things to at night, <line> <line>without the terrible sex price to pay. <line> <line>this is a childish idea, i know. <line> <line>my education, i have to admit, has been gappy. <line> <line>the basic rules of male-female relations <line> <line>were imparted atmospherically in our family, <line> <line>no direct speech allowed. <line> <line>i remember one sunday i was sitting in the backseat of the car. <line> <line>father in front. <line> <line>we were waiting in the driveway for mother, <line> <line>who came around the corner of the house <line> <line>and got into the passenger side of the car <line> <line>dressed in a yellow chanel suit and black high heels. <line> <line>father glanced sideways at her. <line> <line>showing a good bit of leg today mother, he said <line> <line>in a voice which i (age eleven) thought odd. <line> <line>i stared at the back of her head waiting for what she would say. <line> <line>her answer would clear this up. <line> <line>but she just laughed a strange laugh with ropes all over it. <line> <line>later that summer i put this laugh together with another laugh <line> <line>i overheard as i was going upstairs. <line> <line>she was talking on the telephone in the kitchen. <line> <line>well a woman would be just as happy with a kiss on the cheek <line> <line>most of the time but you know men, <line> <line>she was saying. laugh. <line> <line>not ropes, thorns. <line> <line>i have arrived at the middle of the moor <line> <line>where the ground goes down into a low swampy place. <line> <line>the swamp water is frozen solid. <line> <line>bits of gold weed <line> <line>have etched themselves <line> <line>on the underside of the ice like messages. <line> <line> i’ll come when thou art saddest, <line> <line> laid alone in the darkened room; <line> <line> when the mad day’s mirth has vanished, <line> <line> and the smile of joy is banished, <line> <line> i’ll come when the heart’s real feeling <line> <line> has entire, unbiased sway, <line> <line> and my influence o’er thee stealing <line> <line> grief deepening, joy congealing, <line> <line> shall bear thy soul away. <line> <line> listen! ’tis just the hour, <line> <line> the awful time for thee: <line> <line> dost thou not feel upon thy soul <line> <line> a flood of strange sensations roll, <line> <line> forerunners of a sterner power, <line> <line> heralds of me? <line> <line>very hard to read, the messages that pass <line> <line>between thou and emily. <line> <line>in this poem she reverses their roles, <line> <line>speaking not as the victim but to the victim. <line> <line>it is chilling to watch thou move upon thou, <line> <line>who lies alone in the dark waiting to be mastered. <line> <line>it is a shock to realize that this low, slow collusion <line> <line>of master and victim within one voice <line> <line>is a rationale <line> <line>for the most awful loneliness of the poet’s hour. <line> <line>she has reversed the roles of thou and thou <line> <line>not as a display of power <line> <line>but to force out of herself some pity <line> <line>for this soul trapped in glass, <line> <line>which is her true creation. <line> <line>those nights lying alone <line> <line>are not discontinuous with this cold hectic dawn. <line> <line>it is who i am. <line> <line>is it a vocation of anger? <line> <line>why construe silence <line> <line>as the real presence? <line> <line>why stoop to kiss this doorstep? <line> <line>why be unstrung and pounded flat and pine away <line> <line>imagining someone vast to whom i may vent the swell of my soul? <line> <line>emily was fond of psalm 130. <line> <line>“my soul waiteth on thou more than they that watch for the morning, <line> <line>i say more than they that watch for the morning.” <line> <line>i like to believe that for her the act of watching provided a shelter, <line> <line>that her collusion with thou gave ease to anger and desire: <line> <line>”in thou they are quenched as a fire of thorns,“ says the psalmist. <line> <line>but for myself i do not believe this, i am not quenched— <line> <line>with thou or without thou i find no shelter. <line> <line>i am my own nude. <line> <line>and nudes have a difficult sexual destiny. <line> <line>i have watched this destiny disclose itself <line> <line>in its jerky passage from girl to woman to who i am now, <line> <line>from love to anger to this cold marrow, <line> <line>from fire to shelter to fire. <line> <line>what is the opposite of believing in thou— <line> <line>merely not believing in thou? no. that is too simple. <line> <line>that is to prepare a misunderstanding. <line> <line>i want to speak more clearly. <line> <line>perhaps the nudes are the best way. <line> <line>nude #5. deck of cards. <line> <line>each card is made of flesh. <line> <line>the living cards are days of a woman’s life. <line> <line>i see a great silver needle go flashing right through the deck once from end to <line> <line> end. <line> <line>nude #6 i cannot remember. <line> <line>nude #7. white room whose walls, <line> <line>having neither planes nor curves nor angles, <line> <line>are composed of a continuous satiny white membrane <line> <line>like the flesh of some interior organ of the moon. <line> <line>it is a living surface, almost wet. <line> <line>lucency breathes in and out. <line> <line>rainbows shudder across it. <line> <line>and around the walls of the room a voice goes whispering,be very careful. be very careful. <line> <line>nude #8. black disc on which the fires of all the winds <line> <line>are attached in a row. <line> <line>a woman stands on the disc <line> <line>amid the winds whose long yellow silk flames <line> <line>flow and vibrate up through her. <line> <line>nude #9. transparent loam. <line> <line>under the loam a woman has dug a long deep trench. <line> <line>into the trench she is placing small white forms, i don’t know what they are. <line> <line>nude #10. green thorn of the world poking up <line> <line>alive through the heart of a woman <line> <line>who lies on her back on the ground. <line> <line>the thorn is exploding <line> <line>its green blood above her in the air.everything it is it has, the voice says. <line> <line>nude #11. ledge in outer space. <line> <line>space is bluish black and glossy as solid water <line> <line>and moving very fast in all directions, <line> <line>shrieking past the woman who stands pinned <line> <line>to nothing by its pressure. <line> <line>she peers and glances for some way to go, trying to lift her hand but cannot. <line> <line>nude #12. old pole in the wind. <line> <line>cold currents are streaming over it <line> <line>and pulling out <line> <line>into ragged long horizontal black lines <line> <line>some shreds of ribbon <line> <line>attached to the pole. <line> <line>i cannot see how they are attached— <line> <line>notches? staples? nails? all of a sudden the wind changes <line> <line>and all the black shreds rise straight up in the air <line> <line>and tie themselves into knots, <line> <line>then untie and float down. <line> <line>the wind is gone. <line> <line>it waits. <line> <line>by this time, midway through winter, <line> <line>i had become entirely fascinated with my spiritual melodrama. <line> <line>then it stopped. <line> <line>days passed, months passed and i saw nothing. <line> <line>i continued to peer and glance, sitting on the rug in front of my sofa <line> <line>in the curtainless morning <line> <line>with my nerves open to the air like something skinned. <line> <line>i saw nothing. <line> <line>outside the window spring storms came and went. <line> <line>april snow folded its huge white paws over doors and porches. <line> <line>i watched a chunk of it lean over the roof and break off <line> <line>and fall and i thought, <line> <line>how slow! as it glided soundlessly past, <line> <line>but still—nothing. no nudes. <line> <line>no thou. <line> <line>a great icicle formed on the railing of my balcony <line> <line>so i drew up close to the window and tried peering through the icicle, <line> <line>hoping to trick myself into some interior vision, <line> <line>but all i saw <line> <line>was the man and woman in the room across the street <line> <line>making their bed and laughing. <line> <line>i stopped watching. <line> <line>i forgot about nudes. <line> <line>i lived my life, <line> <line>which felt like a switched-off tv. <line> <line>something had gone through me and out and i could not own it. <line> <line>“no need now to tremble for the hard frost and the keen wind. <line> <line>emily does not feel them,” <line> <line>wrote charlotte the day after burying her sister. <line> <line>emily had shaken free. <line> <line>a soul can do that. <line> <line>whether it goes to join thou and sit on the porch for all eternity <line> <line>enjoying jokes and kisses and beautiful cold spring evenings, <line> <line>you and i will never know. but i can tell you what i saw. <line> <line>nude #13 arrived when i was not watching for it. <line> <line>it came at night. <line> <line>very much like nude #1. <line> <line>and yet utterly different. <line> <line>i saw a high hill and on it a form shaped against hard air. <line> <line>it could have been just a pole with some old cloth attached, <line> <line>but as i came closer <line> <line>i saw it was a human body <line> <line>trying to stand against winds so terrible that the flesh was blowing off the bones. <line> <line>and there was no pain. <line> <line>the wind <line> <line>was cleansing the bones. <line>

<line>his throne is built upon eternity, <line>more firm and durable than steel or brass, <line>or the hard diamond, which them both doth pass. <line>his sceptre is the rod of righteousness, <line>with which he bruiseth all his foes to dust, <line>and the great dragon strongly doth repress, <line>under the rigour of his judgement just; <line>his seat is truth, to which the faithful trust, <line>from whence proceed her beams so pure and bright <line>that all about him sheddeth glorious light: <line>light far exceeding that bright blazing spark <line>which darted is from titan's flaming head, <line>that with his beams enlumineth the dark <line>and dampish air, whereby all things are read; <line>whose nature yet so much is marvelled <line>of mortal wits, that it doth much amaze <line>the greatest wizards which thereon do gaze. <line>but that immortal light, which there doth shine, <line>is many thousand times more bright, more clear, <line>more excellent, more glorious, more divine, <line>through which to god all mortal actions here, <line>and even the thoughts of men, do plain appear; <line>for from th' eternal truth it doth proceed, <line>through heavenly virtue which her beams do breed. <line>with the great glory of that wondrous light <line>his throne is all encompassed around, <line>and hid in his own brightness from the sight <line>of all that look thereon with eyes unsound; <line>and underneath his feet are to be found <line>thunder and lightning and tempestuous fire, <line>the instruments of his avenging ire. <line>there in his bosom sapience doth sit, <line>the sovereign darling of the deity, <line>clad like a queen in royal robes, most fit <line>for so great power and peerless majesty, <line>and all with gems and jewels gorgeously <line>adorn'd, that brighter than the stars appear, <line>and make her native brightness seem more clear. <line>and on her head a crown of purest gold <line>is set, in sign of highest sovereignty; <line>and in her hand a sceptre she doth hold, <line>with which she rules the house of god on high, <line>and manageth the ever-moving sky, <line>and in the same these lower creatures all <line>subjected to her power imperial. <line>both heaven and earth obey unto her will, <line>and all the creatures which they both contain; <line>for of her fullness which the world doth fill <line>they all partake, and do in state remain <line>as their great maker did at first ordain, <line>through observation of her high behest, <line>by which they first were made, and still increast. <line>the fairness of her face no tongue can tell;

<line>enough is me t' admire so heavenly thing, <line>and being thus with her huge love possest, <line>in th' only wonder of herself to rest. <line>but whoso may, thrice happy man him hold, <line>of all on earth whom god so much doth grace <line>and lets his own beloved to behold; <line>for in the view of her celestial face <line>all joy, all bliss, all happiness, have place; <line>ne aught on earth can want unto the wight <line>who of herself can win the wishful sight. <line>for she, out of her secret treasury, <line>plenty of riches forth on him will pour, <line>even heavenly riches, which there hidden lie <line>within the closet of her chastest bower, <line>th' eternal portion of her precious dower, <line>which mighty god hath given to her free, <line>and to all those which thereof worthy be. <line>none thereof worthy be, but those whom she <line>vouchsafeth to her presence to receive, <line>and letteth them her lovely face to see, <line>whereof such wondrous pleasures they conceive, <line>and sweet contentment, that it doth bereave <line>their soul of sense, through infinite delight, <line>and them transport from flesh into the spright. <line>in which they see such admirable things, <line>as carries them into an ecstasy, <line>and hear such heavenly notes, and carollings <line>of god's high praise, that fills the brazen sky; <line>and feel such joy and pleasure inwardly, <line>that maketh them all worldly cares forget, <line>and only think on that before them set. <line>ne from thenceforth doth any fleshly sense, <line>or idle thought of earthly things, remain; <line>but all that erst seem'd sweet seems now offence, <line>and all that pleased erst now seems to pain; <line>their joy, their comfort, their desire, their gain, <line>is fixed all on that which now they see; <line>all other sights but feigned shadows be. <line>and that fair lamp, which useth to inflame <line>the hearts of men with self-consuming fire <line>thenceforth seems foul, and full of sinful blame; <line>and all that pomp to which proud minds aspire <line>by name of honour, and so much desire, <line>seems to them baseness, and all riches dross, <line>and all mirth sadness, and all lucre loss. <line>so full their eyes are of that glorious sight, <line>and senses fraught with such satiety, <line>that in nought else on earth they can delight, <line>but in th' aspect of that felicity, <line>which they have written in their inward eye; <line>on which they feed, and in their fastened mind <line>all happy joy and full contentment find. <line>ah, then, my hungry soul, which long hast fed <line>on idle fancies of thy foolish thought, <line>and, with false beauty's flatt'ring bait misled, <line>hast after vain deceitful shadows sought, <line>which all are fled, and now have left thee nought <line>but late repentance through thy follies prief;

(so many virtues shown) ah think, what poet best may make them known? or choose at least some minister of grace, fit to bestow the laureate's weighty place. charles, to late times to be transmitted fair, assign'd his figure to bernini's care; and great nassau to kneller's hand decreed to fix him graceful on the bounding steed; so well in paint and stone they judg'd of merit: but kings in wit may want discerning spirit. the hero william, and the martyr charles, one knighted blackmore, and one pension'd quarles; which made old ben, and surly dennis swear, ""no lord's anointed, but a russian bear."" not with such majesty, such bold relief, the forms august, of king, or conqu'ring chief, e'er swell'd on marble; as in verse have shin'd (in polish'd verse) the manners and the mind. oh! could i mount on the m{ae}onian wing, your arms, your actions, your repose to sing! what seas you travers'd! and what fields you fought! your country's peace, how oft, how dearly bought! how barb'rous rage subsided at your word, and nations wonder'd while they dropp'd the sword! how, when you nodded, o'er the land and deep, peace stole her wing, and wrapp'd the world in sleep; till earth's extremes your mediation own, and asia's tyrants tremble at your throne— but verse, alas! your majesty disdains; and i'm not us'd to panegyric strains: the zeal of fools offends at any time, but most of all, the zeal of fools in rhyme, besides, a fate attends on all i write, that when i aim at praise, they say i bite. a vile encomium doubly ridicules: there's nothing blackens like the ink of fools; if true, a woeful likeness; and if lies, ""praise undeserv'd is scandal in disguise."" well may he blush, who gives it, or receives; and when i flatter, let my dirty leaves (like journals, odes, and such forgotten things as eusden, philips, settle, writ of kings) clothe spice, line trunks, or flutt'ring in a row, befringe the rails of bedlam and soho. <line>","arts & sciences,humor & satire,social commentaries,history & politics"

<line> <line> <line>2 <line> <line> <line> <line>daybreak on my marshland: a single egret, blotched, <line> <line>trudges through the froth. i take its photograph <line> <line>from the rooftop observation deck from which i watch <line> <line> <line> <line>day’s delivery trucks advance. i take advantage of <line> <line>the quiet before their arrival to organize my thoughts <line> <line>on the paranormal thusly: (1) if the human psyche <line> <line> <line> <line>has proven spirited enough to produce such a range <line> <line>of material effects upon what we’ll call the closed <line> <line>system of its custodial body, indeed if it’s expected to, <line> <line> <line> <line>and (2) if such effects might be thought to constitute <line> <line>the physical expression of that psyche, an emanation <line> <line>willed into matter in a manner not unlike a brand- <line> <line> <line> <line>new car or cream-filled cake or disposable camera, <line> <line>and (3) if the system of the body can be swapped out <line> <line>for another, maybe an abandoned factory or a vale, <line> <line> <line> <line>then might it not also prove possible for the psyche <line> <line>by aptitude or lather or sheer circumstance to impress <line> <line>its thumbprint on some other system, a production <line> <line> <line> <line>in the basement, or in a video store, as when i find you <line> <line>inching up steps or down a shady aisle or pathway, <line> <line>dragging your long chains behind you most morosely <line> <line> <line> <line>if you ask me, the question is: did you choose this, or was it <line> <line>imposed on you, but even as i ask your hands move <line> <line>wildly about your throat to indicate you cannot speak. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>3 <line> <line> <line> <line>after the memory of the trucks withdrawing heavy <line> <line>with their cargo fans out and fades into late-morning <line> <line>hunger, i relocate in time to the lit bank of vending <line> <line> <line> <line>machines still humming in the staff-room corner for a light <line> <line>meal of cheese curls, orange soda, and what history <line> <line>will come to mourn as the last two cream-filled cakes. <line> <line> <line> <line>eating in silence, a breeze in the half-light, absently <line> <line>thinking of trying not to think, i imagine the bethlehem <line> <line>steel smokestacks above me piping nonstop, the sky <line> <line> <line> <line>wide open without any question, steam and dioxides <line> <line>of carbon and sulfur, hands pressed to the wall as i walk <line> <line>down the corridor to stop myself from falling awake <line> <line> <line> <line>again on the floor in embarrassment. if there’s any use <line> <line>of imagination more productive or time less painful <line> <line>it hasn’t tried hard enough to push through to find me <line> <line> <line> <line>wandering the wings of a ghost-run factory as earth <line> <line>approaches the dark vale cut in the heart of the galaxy. <line> <line>taking shots of the sunbaked fields of putrefaction <line> <line> <line> <line>visible from the observation deck. hoping to capture <line> <line>what i can point to as the way it feels. sensing my hand <line> <line>in what i push away. watching it dissolve into plumes <line> <line> <line> <line>rising like aerosols, or like ghosts of indigenous peoples, <line> <line>or the lump in the throat to keep me from saying that <line> <line>surviving almost everything has felt like having killed it. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>

<line>massive sphere of rock and ice, of all events in history <line> <line> <line> <line>(plunk) thought to be the lethalmost. a snailsdeath <line> <line>semiquavers from pang to ghost where the habit of ghosts <line> <line>of inhabiting timepieces, of conniving their phantom <line> <line> <line> <line>tendrils through parlor air and into the escapements <line> <line>of some inoperative heirloom clock on a mantel shows <line> <line>not the dead’s ongoing interest in their old adversary <line> <line> <line> <line>(plunk) time so much as an urge to return to the hard <line> <line>mechanical kind of being. an erotic lounging to reanimate <line> <line>the long-inert pendulum. as i have felt you banging <line> <line> <line> <line>nights in my machine, jostling the salt from a pretzel. <line> <line>this passion for the material realm after death however <line> <line>refuses to be reconciled with a willingness to destroy <line> <line> <line> <line>(plunk) it while alive. when the last of the human voices <line> <line>told me what i had to do, they rattled off a shopping <line> <line>list of artifacts they wanted thrown down open throats. <line> <line> <line> <line>that left me feeling in on it, chosen, a real fun-time guy <line> <line>albeit somewhat sleep-deprived; detail-oriented, modern, <line> <line>yes, but also dubious, maudlin, bedridden, speechless. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>5 <line> <line> <line> <line>graffiti on the stonework around the service entrance <line> <line>makes the doorway at night look like the mystagogic <line> <line>mouth of a big beast, amphibious, outfitted with fangs, <line> <line> <line> <line>snout, the suggestion of a tongue, throat, and alimentary <line> <line>canal leading to a complex of caves, tunnels, temples . . . <line> <line>there are rooms i won’t enter, at whose threshold i say <line> <line> <line> <line>this is as far as i go, no farther, almost as if i can sense <line> <line>there’s something in there i don’t want to see, or for which <line> <line>to see means having wanted already to forget, unless <line> <line> <line> <line>stepping into the mouth at last, pressed into its damp, <line> <line>the advantage of not knowing is swapped out for the loss <line> <line>of apartness from what you’d held unknown, meaning <line> <line> <line> <line>you don’t come to know it so much as become it, wholly <line> <line>warping into its absorbent fold. i can’t let that happen <line> <line>if it hasn’t already. what draws me on might be thought <line> <line> <line> <line>canine, keen-sighted, but it’s still incapable of divining why <line> <line>the constant hum around or inside me has to choose <line> <line>among being a nocturne of toxic manufacture, the call <line> <line> <line> <line>of what remains of the jungle, or else just another prank <line> <line>on my gullible anatomy. am i not beset in the utmost <line> <line>basement of industry? is that basement itself not beset <line> <line> <line> <line>by the broad, black-green, waxy leaves of mesoamerica? <line> <line>and haven’t i parted those selfsame leaves, discovering me <line> <line>asleep on my own weapon, threat to no one but myself? <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>6 <line> <line> <line> <line>asked again what i miss the most about my former life, <line> <line>i remember to pause this time, look left, a little off-camera <line> <line>an entire snailsdeath, an air of sifting the possibilities, <line> <line> <line> <line>i eliminate certain objects and events from the running <line> <line>right off the bat, such as when their great displeasure <line> <line>brought the gods to turn to darkness all that had been <line> <line> <line> <line>light, submerging mountaintops in stormwater, the gods <line> <line>shocked by their own power, and heartsick to watch <line> <line>their once dear people stippling the surf like little fishes. <line> <line> <line> <line>or when the flaming peccary of a comet struck the earth <line> <line>with much the same effect, waves as high as ziggurats <line> <line>crashing mathematically against our coastlines, scalding <line> <line> <line> <line>plumes of vapor and aerosols tossed into the atmosphere <line> <line>spawning storms to pummel the far side of the earth, <line> <line>approximately 80 percent of all life vanished in a week. <line> <line> <line> <line>or when we squandered that very earth and shat on it <line> <line>with much the same effect, and more or less on purpose, <line> <line>emitting nonstop gases in the flow of our production, <line> <line> <line> <line>shoveling it in as ancient icecaps melted, what difference <line> <line>could another make now. and so i clear my throat, look <line> <line>directly into the camera, and even though it will make me <line> <line> <line> <line>come off bovine in their eyes, i say that what i miss the most <line> <line>has to be those cream-filled cakes i used to like, but then <line> <line>they prod me with their volts and lead me back to the barn. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>7 <line> <line> <line> <line>after the panic grew more of less customary, the pity <line> <line>dissolved into a mobile fogbank, dense, reducing visibility <line> <line>from the rooftop observation deck. mobile in the sense <line> <line> <line> <line>that it possessed mobility, not in the sense that it actually <line> <line>moved. because it didn’t. it just stayed there, reducing <line> <line>visibility but not in the sense that it simply diminished it <line> <line> <line> <line>or diminished it partly. because it didn’t. it pretty much <line> <line>managed to do away with it altogether, as my photography <line> <line>will come to show: field after field of untouched white. <line> <line> <line> <line>after the possibility of change grew funny, threadbare, <line> <line>too embarrassing to be with, i eased into the knowledge <line> <line>that you’d never appear at the foot of the bed, the vale <line> <line> <line> <line>turned into a lifetime’s heap of laundry, and not the gentle <line> <line>tuffets and streambanks of an afterlife it seems we only <line> <line>imagined remembering, that watercolor done in greens <line> <line> <line> <line>and about which i predicted its monotony of fair weather <line> <line>over time might deaden one all over again, unless being <line> <line>changed with death means not only changing past change <line> <line> <line> <line>but past even the wish for it. i worried to aspire towards <line> <line>that condition might actually dull one’s aptitude for change. <line> <line>that i would grow to protect what i wished to keep from <line> <line> <line> <line>change at the cost of perpetuating much that required it. <line> <line>in this sense i had come to resemble the fogbank, at once <line> <line>given to motion but no less motionless than its photograph. <line> <line> <line> <line>the last time i saw myself alive, i drew the curtain back <line> <line>from the bed, stood by my sleeping body. i felt tenderness <line> <line>towards it. i knew how long it had waited, and how little <line> <line> <line> <line>time remained for it to prepare its bundle of grave-goods. <line> <line>when i tried to speak, rather than my voice, my mouth <line> <line>released the tight, distinctive shriek of an aerophone of clay. <line> <line> <line> <line>i wanted to stop the shock of that from taking away from <line> <line>what i felt. i couldn’t quite manage it. even at this late hour, <line> <line>even here, the purity of a feeling is ruined by the world. <line> <line> <line> <line>8 <line> <line> <line> <line>the noises from the basement were not auspicious noises. <line> <line>i wanted to live forever. i wanted to live forever and die <line> <line>right then and there. i had heard the tight, distinctive shriek. <line> <line> <line> <line>here again and now. i no longer have legs. i am sleeping. <line> <line>long tendrils of tobacco smoke, composed of carbon dioxide, <line> <line>water vapor, ammonia, nitrogen oxide, hydrogen cyanide, <line> <line> <line> <line>and 4,000 other chemical compounds, penetrate the room <line> <line>through the gap beneath the door and through heating vents <line> <line>with confidence. they are the spectral forms of anaconda. <line> <line> <line> <line>the ruler of the underworld smokes cigars. a certain brand. <line> <line>hand-rolled. he smiles as if there is much to smile about. <line> <line>and there is. he is hollow-eyed, toothless. his hat, infamous: <line> <line> <line> <line>broad-brimmed, embellished with feathers, a live macaw. <line> <line>his cape is depicted, often, as a length of fabric in distinctive <line> <line>black and white chevrons. otherwise, as here, the full pelt <line> <line> <line> <line>of a jaguar. on a barge of plywood and empty milk cartons <line> <line>he trudges through the froth. he is the lord of black sorcery <line> <line>and lord of percussion. he is patron of commerce. he parts <line> <line> <line> <line>the leaves of mesoamerica, traveling with a retinue of drunken <line> <line>ax wielders, collection agents. his scribe is a white rabbit. <line> <line>daughter of moon and of night. elsewhere, you are having <line> <line> <line> <line>your teeth taken out. there is no music left, but i still feel held <line> <line>captive by the cinema, and in its custom, i believe myself <line> <line>capable of protecting myself by hiding my face in my hands. <line>","living,the mind,time & brevity,arts & sciences"

""ere it fade,"" <line>said my companion, ""i will show you soon <line>a better station""—so, o'er the lagune <line>we glided; and from that funereal bark <line>i lean'd, and saw the city, and could mark <line>how from their many isles, in evening's gleam, <line>its temples and its palaces did seem <line>like fabrics of enchantment pil'd to heaven. <line>i was about to speak, when—""we are even <line>now at the point i meant,"" said maddalo, <line>and bade the gondolieri cease to row. <line>""look, julian, on the west, and listen well <line>if you hear not a deep and heavy bell."" <line>i look'd, and saw between us and the sun <line>a building on an island; such a one <line>as age to age might add, for uses vile, <line>a windowless, deform'd and dreary pile; <line>and on the top an open tower, where hung <line>a bell, which in the radiance sway'd and swung; <line>we could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue: <line>the broad sun sunk behind it, and it toll'd <line>in strong and black relief. ""what we behold <line>shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower,"" <line>said maddalo, ""and ever at this hour <line>those who may cross the water, hear that bell <line>which calls the maniacs, each one from his cell, <line>to vespers.""

""it remains to know,"" <line>i then rejoin'd, ""and those who try may find <line>how strong the chains are which our spirit bind; <line>brittle perchance as straw.... we are assur'd <line>much may be conquer'd, much may be endur'd, <line>of what degrades and crushes us. we know <line>that we have power over ourselves to do <line>and suffer—what, we know not till we try; <line>but something nobler than to live and die: <line>so taught those kings of old philosophy <line>who reign'd, before religion made men blind; <line>and those who suffer with their suffering kind <line>yet feel their faith, religion."" ""my dear friend,"" <line>said maddalo, ""my judgement will not bend <line>to your opinion, though i think you might <line>make such a system refutation-tight <line>as far as words go. i knew one like you <line>who to this city came some months ago, <line>with whom i argu'd in this sort, and he <line>is now gone mad—and so he answer'd me— <line>poor fellow! but if you would like to go <line>we'll visit him, and his wild talk will show <line>how vain are such aspiring theories."" <line>""i hope to prove the induction otherwise, <line>and that a want of that true theory, still, <line>which seeks a 'soul of goodness' in things ill <line>or in himself or others, has thus bow'd <line>his being. there are some by nature proud, <line>who patient in all else demand but this— <line>to love and be belov'd with gentleness; <line>and being scorn'd, what wonder if they die <line>some living death? this is not destiny <line>but man's own wilful ill."" <line> <line> as thus i spoke <line>servants announc'd the gondola, and we <line>through the fast-falling rain and high-wrought sea <line>sail'd to the island where the madhouse stands. <line> <line>","activities,travels & journeys,relationships,friends & enemies,nature,landscapes & pastorals,arts & sciences,philosophy"

is there news, or any night alarm?"" <line> <line> but sohrab came to the bedside, and said:— <line>""thou know'st me, peran-wisa! it is i. <line>the sun is not yet risen, and the foe <line>sleep; but i sleep not; all night long i lie <line>tossing and wakeful, and i come to thee. <line>for so did king afrasiab bid me seek <line>thy counsel, and to heed thee as thy son, <line>in samarcand, before the army march'd; <line>and i will tell thee what my heart desires. <line>thou know'st if, since from ader-baijan first <line>i came among the tartars and bore arms, <line>i have still served afrasiab well, and shown, <line>at my boy's years, the courage of a man. <line>this too thou know'st, that while i still bear on <line>the conquering tartar ensigns through the world, <line>and beat the persians back on every field, <line>i seek one man, one man, and one alone— <line>rustum, my father; who i hoped should greet, <line>should one day greet, upon some well-fought field, <line>his not unworthy, not inglorious son. <line>so i long hoped, but him i never find. <line>come then, hear now, and grant me what i ask. <line>let the two armies rest to-day; but i <line>will challenge forth the bravest persian lords <line>to meet me, man to man; if i prevail, <line>rustum will surely hear it; if i fall— <line>old man, the dead need no one, claim no kin. <line>dim is the rumour of a common fight, <line>where host meets host, and many names are sunk; <line>but of a single combat fame speaks clear."" <line> <line> he spoke; and peran-wisa took the hand <line>of the young man in his, and sigh'd, and said:— <line> <line> ""o sohrab, an unquiet heart is thine! <line>canst thou not rest among the tartar chiefs, <line>and share the battle's common chance with us <line>who love thee, but must press for ever first, <line>in single fight incurring single risk, <line>to find a father thou hast never seen? <line>that were far best, my son, to stay with us <line>unmurmuring; in our tents, while it is war, <line>and when 'tis truce, then in afrasiab's towns. <line>but, if this one desire indeed rules all, <line>to seek out rustum—seek him not through fight! <line>seek him in peace, and carry to his arms, <line>o sohrab, carry an unwounded son! <line>but far hence seek him, for he is not here. <line>for now it is not as when i was young, <line>when rustum was in front of every fray; <line>but now he keeps apart, and sits at home, <line>in seistan, with zal, his father old. <line>whether that his own mighty strength at last <line>feels the abhorr'd approaches of old age, <line>or in some quarrel with the persian king. <line>there go!—thou wilt not? yet my heart forebodes <line>danger or death awaits thee on this field. <line>fain would i know thee safe and well, though lost <line>to us; fain therefore send thee hence, in peace <line>to seek thy father, not seek single fights <line>in vain;—but who can keep the lion's cub <line>from ravening, and who govern rustum's son? <line>go, i will grant thee what thy heart desires."" <line> <line> so said he, and dropp'd sohrab's hand, and left <line>his bed, and the warm rugs whereon he lay; <line>and o'er his chilly limbs his woollen coat <line>he pass'd, and tied his sandals on his feet, <line>and threw a white cloak round him, and he took <line>in his right hand a ruler's staff, no sword; <line>and on his head he set his sheep-skin cap, <line>black, glossy, curl'd, the fleece of kara-kul; <line>and raised the curtain of his tent, and call'd <line>his herald to his side, and went abroad. <line> <line> the sun by this had risen, and clear'd the fog <line>from the broad oxus and the glittering sands. <line>and from their tents the tartar horsemen filed <line>into the open plain; so haman bade— <line>haman, who next to peran-wisa ruled <line>the host, and still was in his lusty prime. <line>from their black tents, long files of horse, they stream'd; <line>as when some grey november morn the files, <line>in marching order spread, of long-neck'd cranes <line>stream over casbin and the southern slopes <line>of elburz, from the aralian estuaries, <line>or some frore caspian reed-bed, southward bound <line>for the warm persian sea-board—so they stream'd. <line>the tartars of the oxus, the king's guard, <line>first, with black sheep-skin caps and with long spears; <line>large men, large steeds; who from bokhara come <line>and khiva, and ferment the milk of mares. <line>next, the more temperate toorkmuns of the south, <line>the tukas, and the lances of salore, <line>and those from attruck and the caspian sands; <line>light men and on light steeds, who only drink <line>the acrid milk of camels, and their wells. <line>and then a swarm of wandering horse, who came <line>from far, and a more doubtful service own'd; <line>the tartars of ferghana, from the banks <line>of the jaxartes, men with scanty beards <line>and close-set skull-caps; and those wilder hordes <line>who roam o'er kipchak and the northern waste, <line>kalmucks and unkempt kuzzaks, tribes who stray <line>nearest the pole, and wandering kirghizzes, <line>who come on shaggy ponies from pamere; <line>these all filed out from camp into the plain. <line>and on the other side the persians form'd;— <line>first a light cloud of horse, tartars they seem'd, <line>the ilyats of khorassan, and behind, <line>the royal troops of persia, horse and foot, <line>marshall'd battalions bright in burnish'd steel. <line>but peran-wisa with his herald came, <line>threading the tartar squadrons to the front, <line>and with his staff kept back the foremost ranks. <line>and when ferood, who led the persians, saw <line>that peran-wisa kept the tartars back, <line>he took his spear, and to the front he came, <line>and check'd his ranks, and fix'd them where they stood. <line>and the old tartar came upon the sand <line>betwixt the silent hosts, and spake, and said:— <line> <line> ""ferood, and ye, persians and tartars, hear! <line>let there be truce between the hosts to-day. <line>but choose a champion from the persian lords <line>to fight our champion sohrab, man to man."" <line> <line> as, in the country, on a morn in june, <line>when the dew glistens on the pearled ears, <line>a shiver runs through the deep corn for joy— <line>so, when they heard what peran-wisa said, <line>a thrill through all the tartar squadrons ran <line>of pride and hope for sohrab, whom they loved. <line> <line> but as a troop of pedlars, from cabool, <line>cross underneath the indian caucasus, <line>that vast sky-neighbouring mountain of milk snow; <line>crossing so high, that, as they mount, they pass <line>long flocks of travelling birds dead on the snow, <line>choked by the air, and scarce can they themselves <line>slake their parch'd throats with sugar'd mulberries— <line>in single file they move, and stop their breath, <line>for fear they should dislodge the o'erhanging snows— <line>so the pale persians held their breath with fear. <line> <line> and to ferood his brother chiefs came up <line>to counsel; gudurz and zoarrah came, <line>and feraburz, who ruled the persian host <line>second, and was the uncle of the king; <line>these came and counsell'd, and then gudurz said:— <line> <line> ""ferood, shame bids us take their challenge up, <line>yet champion have we none to match this youth. <line>he has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart. <line>but rustum came last night; aloof he sits <line>and sullen, and has pitch'd his tents apart. <line>him will i seek, and carry to his ear <line>the tartar challenge, and this young man's name. <line>haply he will forget his wrath, and fight. <line>stand forth the while, and take their challenge up."" <line> <line> so spake he; and ferood stood forth and cried:— <line>""old man, be it agreed as thou hast said! <line>let sohrab arm, and we will find a man."" <line> <line> he spake: and peran-wisa turn'd, and strode <line>back through the opening squadrons to his tent. <line>but through the anxious persians gudurz ran, <line>and cross'd the camp which lay behind, and reach'd, <line>out on the sands beyond it, rustum's tents. <line>of scarlet cloth they were, and glittering gay, <line>just pitch'd; the high pavilion in the midst <line>was rustum's, and his men lay camp'd around. <line>and gudurz enter'd rustum's tent, and found <line>rustum; his morning meal was done, but still <line>the table stood before him, charged with food— <line>a side of roasted sheep, and cakes of bread, <line>and dark green melons; and there rustum sate <line>listless, and held a falcon on his wrist, <line>and play'd with it; but gudurz came and stood <line>before him; and he look'd, and saw him stand, <line>and with a cry sprang up and dropp'd the bird, <line>and greeted gudurz with both hands, and said:— <line> <line> ""welcome! these eyes could see no better sight. <line>what news? but sit down first, and eat and drink."" <line> <line> but gudurz stood in the tent-door, and said:— <line>""not now! a time will come to eat and drink, <line>but not to-day; to-day has other needs. <line>the armies are drawn out, and stand at gaze; <line>for from the tartars is a challenge brought <line>to pick a champion from the persian lords <line>to fight their champion—and thou know'st his name— <line>sohrab men call him, but his birth is hid. <line>o rustum, like thy might is this young man's! <line>he has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart; <line>and he is young, and iran's chiefs are old, <line>or else too weak; and all eyes turn to thee. <line>come down and help us, rustum, or we lose!'' <line> <line> he spoke; but rustum answer'd with a smile:— <line>""go to! if iran's chiefs are old, then i <line>am older; if the young are weak, the king <line>errs strangely; for the king, for kai khosroo, <line>himself is young, and honours younger men, <line>and lets the aged moulder to their graves. <line>rustum he loves no more, but loves the young— <line>the young may rise at sohrab's vaunts, not i. <line>for what care i, though all speak sohrab's fame? <line>for would that i myself had such a son, <line>and not that one slight helpless girl i have— <line>a son so famed, so brave, to send to war, <line>and i to tarry with the snow-hair'd zal, <line>my father, whom the robber afghans vex, <line>and clip his borders short, and drive his herds, <line>and he has none to guard his weak old age. <line>there would i go, and hang my armour up, <line>and with my great name fence that weak old man, <line>and spend the goodly treasures i have got, <line>and rest my age, and hear of sohrab's fame, <line>and leave to death the hosts of thankless kings, <line>and with these slaughterous hands draw sword no more.'' <line> <line> he spoke, and smiled; and gudurz made reply:— <line>""what then, o rustum, will men say to this, <line>when sohrab dares our bravest forth, and seeks <line>thee most of all, and thou, whom most he seeks, <line>hidest thy face? take heed lest men should say: <line>like some old miser, rustum hoards his fame, and shuns to peril it with younger men."" and, greatly moved, then rustum made reply:— <line>""o gudurz, wherefore dost thou say such words? <line>thou knowest better words than this to say. <line>what is one more, one less, obscure or famed, <line>valiant or craven, young or old, to me? <line>are not they mortal, am not i myself? <line>but who for men of nought would do great deeds? <line>come, thou shalt see how rustum hoards his fame! <line>but i will fight unknown, and in plain arms; <line>let not men say of rustum, he was match'd <line>in single fight with any mortal man."" <line> <line> he spoke, and frown'd; and gudurz turn'd, and ran <line>back quickly through the camp in fear and joy— <line>fear at his wrath, but joy that rustum came. <line>but rustum strode to his tent-door, and call'd <line>his followers in, and bade them bring his arms, <line>and clad himself in steel; the arms he chose <line>were plain, and on his shield was no device, <line>only his helm was rich, inlaid with gold, <line>and, from the fluted spine atop, a plume <line>of horsehair waved, a scarlet horsehair plume. <line>so arm'd, he issued forth; and ruksh, his horse, <line>follow'd him like a faithful hound at heel— <line>ruksh, whose renown was noised through all the earth, <line>the horse, whom rustum on a foray once <line>did in bokhara by the river find <line>a colt beneath its dam, and drove him home, <line>and rear'd him; a bright bay, with lofty crest, <line>dight with a saddle-cloth of broider'd green <line>crusted with gold, and on the ground were work'd <line>all beasts of chase, all beasts which hunters know. <line>so follow'd, rustum left his tents, and cross'd <line>the camp, and to the persian host appear'd. <line>and all the persians knew him, and with shouts <line>hail'd; but the tartars knew not who he was. <line>and dear as the wet diver to the eyes <line>of his pale wife who waits and weeps on shore, <line>by sandy bahrein, in the persian gulf, <line>plunging all day in the blue waves, at night, <line>having made up his tale of precious pearls, <line>rejoins her in their hut upon the sands— <line>so dear to the pale persians rustum came. <line> <line> and rustum to the persian front advanced, <line>and sohrab arm'd in haman's tent, and came. <line>and as afield the reapers cut a swath <line>down through the middle of a rich man's corn, <line>and on each side are squares of standing corn, <line>and in the midst a stubble, short and bare— <line>so on each side were squares of men, with spears <line>bristling, and in the midst, the open sand. <line>and rustum came upon the sand, and cast <line>his eyes toward the tartar tents, and saw <line>sohrab come forth, and eyed him as he came. <line> <line> as some rich woman, on a winter's morn, <line>eyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge <line>who with numb blacken'd fingers makes her fire— <line>at cock-crow, on a starlit winter's morn, <line>when the frost flowers the whiten'd window-panes— <line>and wonders how she lives, and what the thoughts <line>of that poor drudge may be; so rustum eyed <line>the unknown adventurous youth, who from afar <line>came seeking rustum, and defying forth <line>all the most valiant chiefs; long he perused <line>his spirited air, and wonder'd who he was. <line>for very young he seem'd, tenderly rear'd; <line>like some young cypress, tall, and dark, and straight, <line>which in a queen's secluded garden throws <line>its slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf, <line>by midnight, to a bubbling fountain's sound— <line>so slender sohrab seem'd, so softly rear'd. <line>and a deep pity enter'd rustum's soul <line>as he beheld him coming; and he stood, <line>and beckon'd to him with his hand, and said:— <line> <line> ""o thou young man, the air of heaven is soft, <line>and warm, and pleasant; but the grave is cold! <line>heaven's air is better than the cold dead grave. <line>behold me! i am vast, and clad in iron, <line>and tried; and i have stood on many a field <line>of blood, and i have fought with many a foe— <line>never was that field lost, or that foe saved. <line>o sohrab, wherefore wilt thou rush on death? <line>be govern'd! quit the tartar host, and come <line>to iran, and be as my son to me, <line>and fight beneath my banner till i die! <line>there are no youths in iran brave as thou."" <line> <line> so he spake, mildly; sohrab heard his voice, <line>the mighty voice of rustum, and he saw <line>his giant figure planted on the sand, <line>sole, like some single tower, which a chief <line>hath builded on the waste in former years <line>against the robbers; and he saw that head, <line>streak'd with its first grey hairs;—hope filled his soul, <line>and he ran forward and embraced his knees, <line>and clasp'd his hand within his own, and said:— <line> <line> ""o, by thy father's head! by thine own soul! <line>art thou not rustum? speak! art thou not he?"" <line> <line> but rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth, <line>and turn'd away, and spake to his own soul:— <line> <line> ""ah me, i muse what this young fox may mean! <line>false, wily, boastful, are these tartar boys. <line>for if i now confess this thing he asks, <line>and hide it not, but say: rustum is here! he will not yield indeed, nor quit our foes, <line>but he will find some pretext not to fight, <line>and praise my fame, and proffer courteous gifts, <line>a belt or sword perhaps, and go his way. <line>and on a feast-tide, in afrasiab's hall, <line>in samarcand, he will arise and cry: <line>'i challenged once, when the two armies camp'd <line>beside the oxus, all the persian lords <line>to cope with me in single fight; but they <line>shrank, only rustum dared; then he and i <line>changed gifts, and went on equal terms away.' <line>so will he speak, perhaps, while men applaud; <line>then were the chiefs of iran shamed through me."" <line> <line> and then he turn'd, and sternly spake aloud:— <line>""rise! wherefore dost thou vainly question thus <line>of rustum? i am here, whom thou hast call'd <line>by challenge forth; make good thy vaunt, or yield! <line>is it with rustum only thou wouldst fight? <line>rash boy, men look on rustum's face and flee! <line>for well i know, that did great rustum stand <line>before thy face this day, and were reveal'd, <line>there would be then no talk of fighting more. <line>but being what i am, i tell thee this— <line>do thou record it in thine inmost soul: <line>either thou shalt renounce thy vaunt and yield, <line>or else thy bones shall strew this sand, till winds <line>bleach them, or oxus with his summer-floods, <line>oxus in summer wash them all away."" <line> <line> he spoke; and sohrab answer'd, on his feet:— <line>""art thou so fierce? thou wilt not fright me so! <line>i am no girl, to be made pale by words. <line>yet this thou hast said well, did rustum stand <line>here on this field, there were no fighting then. <line>but rustum is far hence, and we stand here. <line>begin! thou art more vast, more dread than i, <line>and thou art proved, i know, and i am young— <line>but yet success sways with the breath of heaven. <line>and though thou thinkest that thou knowest sure <line>thy victory, yet thou canst not surely know. <line>for we are all, like swimmers in the sea, <line>poised on the top of a huge wave of fate, <line>which hangs uncertain to which side to fall. <line>and whether it will heave us up to land, <line>or whether it will roll us out to sea, <line>back out to sea, to the deep waves of death, <line>we know not, and no search will make us know; <line>only the event will teach us in its hour."" <line> <line> he spoke, and rustum answer'd not, but hurl'd <line>his spear; down from the shoulder, down it came, <line>as on some partridge in the corn a hawk, <line>that long has tower'd in the airy clouds, <line>drops like a plummet; sohrab saw it come, <line>and sprang aside, quick as a flash; the spear <line>hiss'd, and went quivering down into the sand, <line>which it sent flying wide;—then sohrab threw <line>in turn, and full struck rustum's shield; sharp rang, <line>the iron plates rang sharp, but turn'd the spear. <line>and rustum seized his club, which none but he <line>could wield; an unlopp'd trunk it was, and huge, <line>still rough—like those which men in treeless plains <line>to build them boats fish from the flooded rivers, <line>hyphasis or hydaspes, when, high up <line>by their dark springs, the wind in winter-time <line>hath made in himalayan forests wrack, <line>and strewn the channels with torn boughs—so huge <line>the club which rustum lifted now, and struck <line>one stroke; but again sohrab sprang aside, <line>lithe as the glancing snake, and the club came <line>thundering to earth, and leapt from rustum's hand. <line>and rustum follow'd his own blow, and fell <line>to his knees, and with his fingers clutch'd the sand; <line>and now might sohrab have unsheathed his sword, <line>and pierced the mighty rustum while he lay <line>dizzy, and on his knees, and choked with sand; <line>but he look'd on, and smiled, nor bared his sword, <line>but courteously drew back, and spoke, and said:— <line> <line> ""thou strik'st too hard! that club of thine will float <line>upon the summer-floods, and not my bones. <line>but rise, and be not wroth! not wroth am i; <line>no, when i see thee, wrath forsakes my soul. <line>thou say'st, thou art not rustum; be it so! <line>who art thou then, that canst so touch my soul? <line>boy as i am, i have seen battles too— <line>have waded foremost in their bloody waves, <line>and heard their hollow roar of dying men; <line>but never was my heart thus touch'd before. <line>are they from heaven, these softenings of the heart? <line>o thou old warrior, let us yield to heaven! <line>come, plant we here in earth our angry spears, <line>and make a truce, and sit upon this sand, <line>and pledge each other in red wine, like friends, <line>and thou shalt talk to me of rustum's deeds. <line>there are enough foes in the persian host, <line>whom i may meet, and strike, and feel no pang; <line>champions enough afrasiab has, whom thou <line>mayst fight; fight them, when they confront thy spear! <line>but oh, let there be peace 'twixt thee and me!"" <line> <line> he ceased, but while he spake, rustum had risen, <line>and stood erect, trembling with rage; his club <line>he left to lie, but had regain'd his spear, <line>whose fiery point now in his mail'd right-hand <line>blazed bright and baleful, like that autumn-star, <line>the baleful sign of fevers; dust had soil'd <line>his stately crest, and dimm'd his glittering arms. <line>his breast heaved, his lips foam'd, and twice his voice <line>was choked with rage; at last these words broke way:— <line> <line> ""girl! nimble with thy feet, not with thy hands! <line>curl'd minion, dancer, coiner of sweet words! <line>fight, let me hear thy hateful voice no more! <line>thou art not in afrasiab's gardens now <line>with tartar girls, with whom thou art wont to dance; <line>but on the oxus-sands, and in the dance <line>of battle, and with me, who make no play <line>of war; i fight it out, and hand to hand. <line>speak not to me of truce, and pledge, and wine! <line>remember all thy valour; try thy feints <line>and cunning! all the pity i had is gone; <line>because thou hast shamed me before both the hosts <line>with thy light skipping tricks, and thy girl's wiles."" <line> <line> he spoke, and sohrab kindled at his taunts, <line>and he too drew his sword; at once they rush'd <line>together, as two eagles on one prey <line>come rushing down together from the clouds, <line>one from the east, one from the west; their shields <line>dash'd with a clang together, and a din <line>rose, such as that the sinewy woodcutters <line>make often in the forest's heart at morn, <line>of hewing axes, crashing trees—such blows <line>rustum and sohrab on each other hail'd. <line>and you would say that sun and stars took part <line>in that unnatural conflict; for a cloud <line>grew suddenly in heaven, and dark'd the sun <line>over the fighters' heads; and a wind rose <line>under their feet, and moaning swept the plain, <line>and in a sandy whirlwind wrapp'd the pair. <line>in gloom they twain were wrapp'd, and they alone; <line>for both the on-looking hosts on either hand <line>stood in broad daylight, and the sky was pure, <line>and the sun sparkled on the oxus stream. <line>but in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes <line>and labouring breath; first rustum struck the shield <line>which sohrab held stiff out; the steel-spiked spear <line>rent the tough plates, but fail'd to reach the skin, <line>and rustum pluck'd it back with angry groan. <line>then sohrab with his sword smote rustum's helm, <line>nor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest <line>he shore away, and that proud horsehair plume, <line>never till now defiled, sank to the dust; <line>and rustum bow'd his head; but then the gloom <line>grew blacker, thunder rumbled in the air, <line>and lightnings rent the cloud; and ruksh, the horse, <line>who stood at hand, utter'd a dreadful cry;— <line>no horse's cry was that, most like the roar <line>of some pain'd desert-lion, who all day <line>hath trail'd the hunter's javelin in his side, <line>and comes at night to die upon the sand. <line>the two hosts heard that cry, and quaked for fear, <line>and oxus curdled as it cross'd his stream. <line>but sohrab heard, and quail'd not, but rush'd on, <line>and struck again; and again rustum bow'd <line>his head; but this time all the blade, like glass, <line>sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm, <line>and in the hand the hilt remain'd alone. <line>then rustum raised his head; his dreadful eyes <line>glared, and he shook on high his menacing spear, <line>and shouted: rustum!—sohrab heard that shout, <line>and shrank amazed; back he recoil'd one step, <line>and scann'd with blinking eyes the advancing form, <line>and then he stood bewilder'd; and he dropp'd <line>his covering shield, and the spear pierced his side. <line>he reel'd, and staggering back, sank to the ground; <line>and then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell, <line>and the bright sun broke forth, and melted all <line>the cloud; and the two armies saw the pair— <line>saw rustum standing, safe upon his feet, <line>and sohrab, wounded, on the bloody sand. <line> <line> then, with a bitter smile, rustum began:— <line>""sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill <line>a persian lord this day, and strip his corpse, <line>and bear thy trophies to afrasiab's tent. <line>or else that the great rustum would come down <line>himself to fight, and that thy wiles would move <line>his heart to take a gift, and let thee go. <line>and then that all the tartar host would praise <line>thy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame, <line>to glad thy father in his weak old age. <line>fool, thou art slain, and by an unknown man! <line>dearer to the red jackals shalt thou be <line>than to thy friends, and to thy father old."" <line> <line> and, with a fearless mien, sohrab replied:— <line>""unknown thou art; yet thy fierce vaunt is vain. <line>thou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man! <line>no! rustum slays me, and this filial heart. <line>for were i match'd with ten such men as thee, <line>and i were that which till to-day i was, <line>they should be lying here, i standing there. <line>but that belovéd name unnerved my arm— <line>that name, and something, i confess, in thee, <line>which troubles all my heart, and made my shield <line>fall; and thy spear transfix'd an unarm'd foe. <line>and now thou boastest, and insult'st my fate. <line>but hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to hear: <line>the mighty rustum shall avenge my death! <line>my father, whom i seek through all the world, <line>he shall avenge my death, and punish thee!"" <line> <line> as when some hunter in the spring hath found <line>a breeding eagle sitting on her nest, <line>upon the craggy isle of a hill-lake, <line>and pierced her with an arrow as she rose, <line>and follow'd her to find her where she fell <line>far off;—anon her mate comes winging back <line>from hunting, and a great way off descries <line>his huddling young left sole; at that, he checks <line>his pinion, and with short uneasy sweeps <line>circles above his eyry, with loud screams <line>chiding his mate back to her nest; but she <line>lies dying, with the arrow in her side, <line>in some far stony gorge out of his ken, <line>a heap of fluttering feathers—never more <line>shall the lake glass her, flying over it; <line>never the black and dripping precipices <line>echo her stormy scream as she sails by— <line>as that poor bird flies home, nor knows his loss, <line>so rustum knew not his own loss, but stood <line>over his dying son, and knew him not. <line> <line> but, with a cold, incredulous voice, he said:— <line>""what prate is this of fathers and revenge? <line>the mighty rustum never had a son."" <line> <line> and, with a failing voice, sohrab replied:— <line>""ah yes, he had! and that lost son am i. <line>surely the news will one day reach his ear, <line>reach rustum, where he sits, and tarries long, <line>somewhere, i know not where, but far from here; <line>and pierce him like a stab, and make him leap <line>to arms, and cry for vengeance upon thee. <line>fierce man, bethink thee, for an only son! <line>what will that grief, what will that vengeance be? <line>oh, could i live, till i that grief had seen! <line>yet him i pity not so much, but her, <line>my mother, who in ader-baijan dwells <line>with that old king, her father, who grows grey <line>with age, and rules over the valiant koords. <line>her most i pity, who no more will see <line>sohrab returning from the tartar camp, <line>with spoils and honour, when the war is done. <line>but a dark rumour will be bruited up, <line>from tribe to tribe, until it reach her ear; <line>and then will that defenceless woman learn <line>that sohrab will rejoice her sight no more, <line>but that in battle with a nameless foe, <line>by the far-distant oxus, he is slain."" <line> <line> he spoke; and as he ceased, he wept aloud, <line>thinking of her he left, and his own death. <line>he spoke; but rustum listen'd, plunged in thought. <line>nor did he yet believe it was his son <line>who spoke, although he call'd back names he knew; <line>for he had had sure tidings that the babe, <line>which was in ader-baijan born to him, <line>had been a puny girl, no boy at all— <line>so that sad mother sent him word, for fear <line>rustum should seek the boy, to train in arms. <line>and so he deem'd that either sohrab took, <line>by a false boast, the style of rustum's son; <line>or that men gave it him, to swell his fame. <line>so deem'd he; yet he listen'd, plunged in thought <line>and his soul set to grief, as the vast tide <line>of the bright rocking ocean sets to shore <line>at the full moon; tears gather'd in his eyes; <line>for he remember'd his own early youth, <line>and all its bounding rapture; as, at dawn, <line>the shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries <line>a far, bright city, smitten by the sun, <line>through many rolling clouds—so rustum saw <line>his youth; saw sohrab's mother, in her bloom; <line>and that old king, her father, who loved well <line>his wandering guest, and gave him his fair child <line>with joy; and all the pleasant life they led, <line>they three, in that long-distant summer-time— <line>the castle, and the dewy woods, and hunt <line>and hound, and morn on those delightful hills <line>in ader-baijan. and he saw that youth, <line>of age and looks to be his own dear son, <line>piteous and lovely, lying on the sand, <line>like some rich hyacinth which by the scythe <line>of an unskilful gardener has been cut, <line>mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed, <line>and lies, a fragrant tower of purple bloom, <line>on the mown, dying grass—so sohrab lay, <line>lovely in death, upon the common sand. <line>and rustum gazed on him with grief, and said:— <line> <line> ""o sohrab, thou indeed art such a son <line>whom rustum, wert thou his, might well have loved! <line>yet here thou errest, sohrab, or else men <line>have told thee false—thou art not rustum's son. <line>for rustum had no son; one child he had— <line>but one—a girl; who with her mother now <line>plies some light female task, nor dreams of us— <line>of us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war."" <line> <line> but sohrab answer'd him in wrath: for now <line>the anguish of the deep-fix'd spear grew fierce, <line>and he desired to draw forth the steel, <line>and let the blood flow free, and so to die— <line>but first he would convince his stubborn foe; <line>and, rising sternly on one arm, he said:— <line> <line> ""man, who art thou who dost deny my words? <line>truth sits upon the lips of dying men, <line>and falsehood, while i lived, was far from mine. <line>i tell thee, prick'd upon this arm i bear <line>that seal which rustum to my mother gave, <line>that she might prick it on the babe she bore."" <line> <line> he spoke; and all the blood left rustum's cheeks, <line>and his knees totter'd, and he smote his hand <line>against his breast, his heavy mailed hand, <line>that the hard iron corslet clank'd aloud; <line>and to his heart he press'd the other hand, <line>and in a hollow voice he spake, and said:— <line> <line> ""sohrab, that were a proof which could not lie! <line>if thou show this, then art thou rustum's son."" <line> <line> then, with weak hasty fingers, sohrab loosed <line>his belt, and near the shoulder bared his arm, <line>and show'd a sign in faint vermilion points <line>prick'd; as a cunning workman, in pekin, <line>pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase, <line>an emperor's gift—at early morn he paints, <line>and all day long, and, when night comes, the lamp <line>lights up his studious forehead and thin hands— <line>so delicately prick'd the sign appear'd <line>on sohrab's arm, the sign of rustum's seal. <line>it was that griffin, which of old rear'd zal, <line>rustum's great father, whom they left to die, <line>a helpless babe, among the mountain-rocks; <line>him that kind creature found, and rear'd, and loved— <line>then rustum took it for his glorious sign. <line>and sohrab bared that image on his arm, <line>and himself scann'd it long with mournful eyes, <line>and then he touch'd it with his hand and said:— <line> <line> ""how say'st thou? is that sign the proper sign <line>of rustum's son, or of some other man's?"" <line> <line> he spoke; but rustum gazed, and gazed, and stood <line>speechless; and then he utter'd one sharp cry: <line>o boy—thy father!—and his voice choked there. <line>and then a dark cloud pass'd before his eyes, <line>and his head swam, and he sank down to earth. <line>but sohrab crawl'd to where he lay, and cast <line>his arms about his neck, and kiss'd his lips, <line>and with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks, <line>trying to call him back to life; and life <line>came back to rustum, and he oped his eyes, <line>and they stood wide with horror; and he seized <line>in both his hands the dust which lay around, <line>and threw it on his head, and smirch'd his hair,— <line>his hair, and face, and beard, and glittering arms; <line>and strong convulsive groanings shook his breast, <line>and his sobs choked him; and he clutch'd his sword, <line>to draw it, and for ever let life out. <line>but sohrab saw his thoughts, and held his hands <line>and with a soothing voice he spake, and said:— <line> <line> ""father, forbear! for i but meet to-day <line>the doom which at my birth was written down <line>in heaven, and thou art heaven's unconscious hand. <line>surely my heart cried out that it was thou, <line>when first i saw thee; and thy heart spoke too, <line>i know it! but fate trod those promptings down <line>under its iron heel; fate, fate engaged <line>the strife, and hurl'd me on my father's spear. <line>but let us speak no more of this! i find <line>my father; let me feel that i have found! <line>come, sit beside me on this sand, and take <line>my head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks, <line>and wash them with thy tears, and say: my son! quick! quick! for number'd are my sands of life, <line>and swift; for like the lightning to this field <line>i came, and like the wind i go away— <line>sudden, and swift, and like a passing wind. <line>but it was writ in heaven that this should be."" <line> <line> so said he, and his voice released the heart <line>of rustum, and his tears broke forth; he cast <line>his arms round his son's neck, and wept aloud, <line>and kiss'd him. and awe fell on both the hosts, <line>when they saw rustum's grief; and ruksh, the horse, <line>with his head bowing to the ground and mane <line>sweeping the dust, came near, and in mute woe <line>first to the one then to the other moved <line>his head, as if enquiring what their grief <line>might mean; and from his dark, compassionate eyes, <line>the big warm tears roll'd down, and caked the sand. <line>but rustum chid him with stern voice, and said:— <line> <line> ""ruksh, now thou grievest; but, o ruksh, thy feet <line>should first have rotted on their nimble joints, <line>or ere they brought thy master to this field!"" <line> <line> but sohrab look'd upon the horse and said;— <line>""is this, then, ruksh? how often, in past days <line>my mother told me of thee, thou brave steed, <line>my terrible father's terrible horse! and said, <line>that i should one day find thy lord and thee. <line>come, let me lay my hand upon thy mane! <line>o ruksh, thou art more fortunate than i; <line>for thou has gone where i shall never go, <line>and snuff'd the breezes of my father's home. <line>and thou hast trod the sands of seistan, <line>and seen the river of helmund, and the lake <line>of zirrah; and the aged zal himself <line>has often stroked thy neck, and given thee food, <line>corn in a golden platter soak'd with wine, <line>and said; o ruksh! bear rustrum well!—but i <line>have never known my grandsire's furrow'd face, <line>nor seen his lofty house in seistan, <line>nor slaked my thirst at the clear helmund stream; <line>but lodged among my father's foes, and seen <line>afrasiab's cities only, samarcand, <line>bokhara, and lone khiva in the waste, <line>and the black toorkmun tents; and only drunk <line>the desert rivers, moorghab and tejend, <line>kohik, and where the kalmuks feed their sheep, <line>the northern sir; and this great oxus stream, <line>the yellow oxus, by whose brink i die."" <line> <line> then, with a heavy groan, rustum bewail'd:— <line>""oh, that its waves were flowing over me! <line>oh, that i saw its grains of yellow silt <line>roll, tumbling in the current o'er my head!"" <line> <line> but, with a grave mild voice, sohrab replied:— <line>""desire not that, my father! thou must live. <line>for some are born to do great deeds, and live, <line>as some are born to be obscured, and die. <line>do thou the deeds i die too young to do, <line>and reap a second glory in thine age; <line>thou art my father, and thy gain is mine. <line>but come! thou seest this great host of men <line>which follow me; i pray thee, slay not these! <line>let me entreat for them; what have they done? <line>they follow'd me, my hope, my fame, my star. <line>let them all cross the oxus back in peace. <line>but me thou must bear hence, not send with them, <line>but carry me with thee to seistan, <line>and place me on a bed, and mourn for me, <line>thou, and the snow-hair'd zal, and all thy friends. <line>and thou must lay me in that lovely earth, <line>and heap a stately mound above my bones, <line>and plant a far-seen pillar over all. <line>that so the passing horseman on the waste <line>may see my tomb a great way off, and cry: <line>sohrab, the mighty rustum's son, lies there, whom his great father did in ignorance kill! and i be not forgotten in my grave."" <line> <line> and, with a mournful voice, rustum replied:— <line>""fear not! as thou hast said, sohrab, my son, <line>so shall it be; for i will burn my tents, <line>and quit the host, and bear thee hence with me, <line>and carry thee away to seistan, <line>and place thee on a bed, and mourn for thee, <line>with the snow-headed zal, and all my friends. <line>and i will lay thee in the lovely earth, <line>and heap a stately mound above thy bones, <line>and plant a far-seen pillar over all, <line>and men shall not forget thee in thy grave. <line>and i will spare thy host; yea, let them go! <line>let them all cross the oxus back in peace! <line>what should i do with slaying any more? <line>for would that all whom i have ever slain <line>might be once more alive; my bitterest foes, <line>and they who were call'd champions in their time, <line>and through whose death i won that fame i have— <line>and i were nothing but a common man, <line>a poor, mean soldier, and without renown, <line>so thou mightest live too, my son, my son! <line>or rather would that i, even i myself, <line>might now be lying on this bloody sand, <line>near death, and by an ignorant stroke of thine, <line>not thou of mine! and i might die, not thou; <line>and i, not thou, be borne to seistan; <line>and zal might weep above my grave, not thine; <line>and say: o son, i weep thee not too sore, for willingly, i know, thou met'st thine end! but now in blood and battles was my youth, <line>and full of blood and battles is my age, <line>and i shall never end this life of blood."" <line> <line> then, at the point of death, sohrab replied:— <line>""a life of blood indeed, thou dreadful man!

<line>till then, if fate so wills, let me endure."" <line> <line> he spoke; and sohrab smiled on him, and took <line>the spear, and drew it from his side, and eased <line>his wound's imperious anguish; but the blood <line>came welling from the open gash, and life <line>flow'd with the stream;—all down his cold white side <line>the crimson torrent ran, dim now and soil'd, <line>like the soil'd tissue of white violets <line>left, freshly gather'd, on their native bank, <line>by children whom their nurses call with haste <line>indoors from the sun's eye; his head droop'd low, <line>his limbs grew slack; motionless, white, he lay— <line>white, with eyes closed; only when heavy gasps, <line>deep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame, <line>convulsed him back to life, he open'd them, <line>and fix'd them feebly on his father's face; <line>till now all strength was ebb'd, and from his limbs <line>unwillingly the spirit fled away, <line>regretting the warm mansion which it left, <line>and youth, and bloom, and this delightful world. <line> <line> so, on the bloody sand, sohrab lay dead; <line>and the great rustum drew his horseman's cloak <line>down o'er his face, and sate by his dead son. <line>as those black granite pillars, once high-rear'd <line>by jemshid in persepolis, to bear <line>his house, now 'mid their broken flights of steps <line>lie prone, enormous, down the mountain side— <line>so in the sand lay rustum by his son. <line> <line> and night came down over the solemn waste, <line>and the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair, <line>and darken'd all; and a cold fog, with night, <line>crept from the oxus. soon a hum arose, <line>as of a great assembly loosed, and fires <line>began to twinkle through the fog; for now <line>both armies moved to camp, and took their meal; <line>the persians took it on the open sands <line>southward, the tartars by the river marge; <line>and rustum and his son were left alone. <line> <line> but the majestic river floated on, <line>out of the mist and hum of that low land, <line>into the frosty starlight, and there moved, <line>rejoicing, through the hush'd chorasmian waste, <line>under the solitary moon;—he flow'd <line>right for the polar star, past orgunjè, <line>brimming, and bright, and large; then sands begin <line>to hem his watery march, and dam his streams, <line>and split his currents; that for many a league <line>the shorn and parcell'd oxus strains along <line>through beds of sand and matted rushy isles— <line>oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had <line>in his high mountain-cradle in pamere, <line>a foil'd circuitous wanderer—till at last <line>the long'd-for dash of waves is heard, and wide <line>his luminous home of waters opens, bright <line>and tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars <line>emerge, and shine upon the aral sea. <line> <line>","relationships,friends & enemies,nature,landscapes & pastorals,seas, rivers, & streams,religion,social commentaries,war & conflict,mythology & folklore,heroes & patriotism"
