then forgive this boast, belovèd brethren, and withdraw no portion of your wonted favour now! mother of this unfathomable world! favour my solemn song, for i have loved thee ever, and thee only; i have watched thy shadow, and the darkness of thy steps, and my heart ever gazes on the depth of thy deep mysteries. i have made my bed in charnels and on coffins, where black death keeps record of the trophies won from thee, hoping to still these obstinate questionings of thee and thine, by forcing some lone ghost thy messenger, to render up the tale of what we are. in lone and silent hours, when night makes a weird sound of its own stillness, like an inspired and desperate alchymist staking his very life on some dark hope, have i mixed awful talk and asking looks with my most innocent love, until strange tears uniting with those breathless kisses, made such magic as compels the charmèd night to render up thy charge:...and, though ne'er yet thou hast unveiled thy inmost sanctuary, enough from incommunicable dream, and twilight phantasms, and deep noon-day thought, has shone within me, that serenely now and moveless, as a long-forgotten lyre suspended in the solitary dome of some mysterious and deserted fane, i wait thy breath, great parent, that my strain may modulate with murmurs of the air, and motions of the forests and the sea, and voice of living beings, and woven hymns of night and day, and the deep heart of man. there was a poet whose untimely tomb no human hands with pious reverence reared, but the charmed eddies of autumnal winds built o'er his mouldering bones a pyramid of mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness:— a lovely youth,—no mourning maiden decked with weeping flowers, or votive cypress wreath, the lone couch of his everlasting sleep:— gentle, and brave, and generous,—no lorn bard breathed o'er his dark fate one melodious sigh: he lived, he died, he sung, in solitude. strangers have wept to hear his passionate notes, and virgins, as unknown he passed, have pined and wasted for fond love of his wild eyes. the fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn, and silence, too enamoured of that voice, locks its mute music in her rugged cell. by solemn vision, and bright silver dream, his infancy was nurtured. every sight and sound from the vast earth and ambient air, sent to his heart its choicest impulses. the fountains of divine philosophy fled not his thirsting lips, and all of great, or good, or lovely, which the sacred past in truth or fable consecrates, he felt and knew. when early youth had past, he left his cold fireside and alienated home to seek strange truths in undiscovered lands. many a wide waste and tangled wilderness has lured his fearless steps; and he has bought with his sweet voice and eyes, from savage men, his rest and food. nature's most secret steps he like her shadow has pursued, where'er the red volcano overcanopies its fields of snow and pinnacles of ice with burning smoke, or where bitumen lakes on black bare pointed islets ever beat with sluggish surge, or where the secret caves rugged and dark, winding among the springs of fire and poison, inaccessible to avarice or pride, their starry domes of diamond and of gold expand above numberless and immeasurable halls, frequent with crystal column, and clear shrines of pearl, and thrones radiant with chrysolite. nor had that scene of ampler majesty than gems or gold, the varying roof of heaven and the green earth lost in his heart its claims to love and wonder; he would linger long in lonesome vales, making the wild his home, until the doves and squirrels would partake from his innocuous hand his bloodless food, lured by the gentle meaning of his looks, and the wild antelope, that starts whene'er the dry leaf rustles in the brake, suspend her timid steps to gaze upon a form more graceful than her own. his wandering step obedient to high thoughts, has visited the awful ruins of the days of old: athens, and tyre, and balbec, and the waste where stood jerusalem, the fallen towers of babylon, the eternal pyramids, memphis and thebes, and whatsoe'er of strange sculptured on alabaster obelisk, or jasper tomb, or mutilated sphynx, dark æthiopia in her desert hills conceals. among the ruined temples there, stupendous columns, and wild images of more than man, where marble daemons watch the zodiac's brazen mystery, and dead men hang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around, he lingered, poring on memorials of the world's youth, through the long burning day gazed on those speechless shapes, nor, when the moon filled the mysterious halls with floating shades suspended he that task, but ever gazed and gazed, till meaning on his vacant mind flashed like strong inspiration, and he saw the thrilling secrets of the birth of time. meanwhile an arab maiden brought his food, her daily portion, from her father's tent, and spread her matting for his couch, and stole from duties and repose to tend his steps:— enamoured, yet not daring for deep awe to speak her love:—and watched his nightly sleep, sleepless herself, to gaze upon his lips parted in slumber, whence the regular breath of innocent dreams arose: then, when red morn made paler the pale moon, to her cold home wildered, and wan, and panting, she returned. the poet wandering on, through arabie and persia, and the wild carmanian waste, and o'er the aërial mountains which pour down indus and oxus from their icy caves, in joy and exultation held his way; till in the vale of cashmire, far within its loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower, beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched his languid limbs. a vision on his sleep there came, a dream of hopes that never yet had flushed his cheek. he dreamed a veilèd maid sate near him, talking in low solemn tones. her voice was like the voice of his own soul heard in the calm of thought; its music long, like woven sounds of streams and breezes, held his inmost sense suspended in its web of many-coloured woof and shifting hues. knowledge and truth and virtue were her theme, and lofty hopes of divine liberty, thoughts the most dear to him, and poesy, herself a poet. soon the solemn mood of her pure mind kindled through all her frame a permeating fire: wild numbers then she raised, with voice stifled in tremulous sobs subdued by its own pathos: her fair hands were bare alone, sweeping from some strange harp strange symphony, and in their branching veins the eloquent blood told an ineffable tale. the beating of her heart was heard to fill the pauses of her music, and her breath tumultuously accorded with those fits of intermitted song. sudden she rose, as if her heart impatiently endured its bursting burthen: at the sound he turned, and saw by the warm light of their own life her glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil of woven wind, her outspread arms now bare, her dark locks floating in the breath of night, her beamy bending eyes, her parted lips outstretched, and pale, and quivering eagerly. his strong heart sunk and sickened with excess of love. he reared his shuddering limbs and quelled his gasping breath, and spread his arms to meet her panting bosom:...she drew back a while, then, yielding to the irresistible joy, with frantic gesture and short breathless cry folded his frame in her dissolving arms. now blackness veiled his dizzy eyes, and night involved and swallowed up the vision; sleep, like a dark flood suspended in its course rolled back its impulse on his vacant brain. roused by the shock he started from his trance— the cold white light of morning, the blue moon low in the west, the clear and garish hills, the distinct valley and the vacant woods, spread round him where he stood. whither have fled the hues of heaven that canopied his bower of yesternight? the sounds that soothed his sleep, the mystery and the majesty of earth, the joy, the exultation? his wan eyes gaze on the empty scene as vacantly as ocean's moon looks on the moon in heaven. the spirit of sweet human love has sent a vision to the sleep of him who spurned her choicest gifts. he eagerly pursues beyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade; he overleaps the bounds. alas! alas! were limbs and breath and being intertwined thus treacherously? lost, lost, for ever lost, in the wide pathless desert of dim sleep, that beautiful shape! does the dark gate of death conduct to thy mysterious paradise, o sleep? does the bright arch of rainbow clouds, and pendent mountains seen in the calm lake, lead only to a black and watery depth, while death's blue vault, with loathliest vapours hung, where every shade which the foul grave exhales hides its dead eye from the detested day, conduct, o sleep, to thy delightful realms? this doubt with sudden tide flowed on his heart, the insatiate hope which it awakened stung his brain even like despair. while daylight held the sky, the poet kept mute conference with his still soul. at night the passion came, like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream, and shook him from his rest, and led him forth into the darkness.—as an eagle grasped in folds of the green serpent, feels her breast burn with the poison, and precipitates through night and day, tempest, and calm, and cloud, frantic with dizzying anguish, her blind flight o'er the wide aëry wilderness: thus driven by the bright shadow of that lovely dream, beneath the cold glare of the desolate night, through tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells, startling with careless step the moonlight snake, he fled. red morning dawned upon his flight, shedding the mockery of its vital hues upon his cheek of death. he wandered on till vast aornos, seen from petra's steep, hung o'er the low horizon like a cloud; through balk, and where the desolated tombs of parthian kings scatter to every wind their wasting dust, wildly he wandered on, day after day a weary waste of hours, bearing within his life the brooding care that ever fed on its decaying flame. and now his limbs were lean; his scattered hair sered by the autumn of strange suffering sung dirges in the wind; his listless hand hung like dead bone within its withered skin; life, and the lustre that consumed it, shone as in a furnace burning secretly from his dark eyes alone. the cottagers, who ministered with human charity his human wants, beheld with wondering awe their fleeting visitant. the mountaineer, encountering on some dizzy precipice that spectral form, deemed that the spirit of wind with lightning eyes, and eager breath, and feet disturbing not the drifted snow, had paused in its career: the infant would conceal his troubled visage in his mother's robe in terror at the glare of those wild eyes, to remember their strange light in many a dream of after-times; but youthful maidens, taught by nature, would interpret half the woe that wasted him, would call him with false names brother, and friend, would press his pallid hand at parting, and watch, dim through tears, the path of his departure from their father's door. at length upon the lone chorasmian shore he paused, a wide and melancholy waste of putrid marshes. a strong impulse urged his steps to the sea-shore. a swan was there, beside a sluggish stream among the reeds. it rose as he approached, and with strong wings scaling the upward sky, bent its bright course high over the immeasurable main. his eyes pursued its flight.—""thou hast a home, beautiful bird; thou voyagest to thine home, where thy sweet mate will twine her downy neck with thine, and welcome thy return with eyes bright in the lustre of their own fond joy. and what am i that i should linger here, with voice far sweeter than thy dying notes, spirit more vast than thine, frame more attuned to beauty, wasting these surpassing powers in the deaf air, to the blind earth, and heaven that echoes not my thoughts?"" a gloomy smile of desperate hope wrinkled his quivering lips. for sleep, he knew, kept most relentlessly its precious charge, and silent death exposed, faithless perhaps as sleep, a shadowy lure, with doubtful smile mocking its own strange charms. startled by his own thoughts he looked around. there was no fair fiend near him, not a sight or sound of awe but in his own deep mind. a little shallop floating near the shore caught the impatient wandering of his gaze. it had been long abandoned, for its sides gaped wide with many a rift, and its frail joints swayed with the undulations of the tide. a restless impulse urged him to embark and meet lone death on the drear ocean's waste; for well he knew that mighty shadow loves the slimy caverns of the populous deep. the day was fair and sunny: sea and sky drank its inspiring radiance, and the wind swept strongly from the shore, blackening the waves. following his eager soul, the wanderer leaped in the boat, he spread his cloak aloft on the bare mast, and took his lonely seat, and felt the boat speed o'er the tranquil sea like a torn cloud before the hurricane. as one that in a silver vision floats obedient to the sweep of odorous winds upon resplendent clouds, so rapidly along the dark and ruffled waters fled the straining boat.—a whirlwind swept it on, with fierce gusts and precipitating force, through the white ridges of the chafèd sea. the waves arose. higher and higher still their fierce necks writhed beneath the tempest's scourge like serpents struggling in a vulture's grasp. calm and rejoicing in the fearful war of wave ruining on wave, and blast on blast descending, and black flood on whirlpool driven with dark obliterating course, he sate: as if their genii were the ministers appointed to conduct him to the light of those belovèd eyes, the poet sate holding the steady helm. evening came on, the beams of sunset hung their rainbow hues high 'mid the shifting domes of sheeted spray that canopied his path o'er the waste deep; twilight, ascending slowly from the east, entwined in duskier wreaths her braided locks o'er the fair front and radiant eyes of day; night followed, clad with stars. on every side more horribly the multitudinous streams of ocean's mountainous waste to mutual war rushed in dark tumult thundering, as to mock the calm and spangled sky. the little boat still fled before the storm; still fled, like foam down the steep cataract of a wintry river; now pausing on the edge of the riven wave; now leaving far behind the bursting mass that fell, convulsing ocean. safely fled— as if that frail and wasted human form, had been an elemental god. at midnight the moon arose: and lo! the ethereal cliffs of caucasus, whose icy summits shone among the stars like sunlight, and around whose caverned base the whirlpools and the waves bursting and eddying irresistibly rage and resound for ever.—who shall save?— the boat fled on,—the boiling torrent drove,— the crags closed round with black and jaggèd arms, the shattered mountain overhung the sea, and faster still, beyond all human speed, suspended on the sweep of the smooth wave, the little boat was driven. a cavern there yawned, and amid its slant and winding depths ingulfed the rushing sea. the boat fled on with unrelaxing speed.—""vision and love!"" the poet cried aloud, ""i have beheld the path of thy departure. sleep and death shall not divide us long!"" the boat pursued the windings of the cavern. daylight shone at length upon that gloomy river's flow; now, where the fiercest war among the waves is calm, on the unfathomable stream the boat moved slowly. where the mountain, riven, exposed those black depths to the azure sky, ere yet the flood's enormous volume fell even to the base of caucasus, with sound that shook the everlasting rocks, the mass filled with one whirlpool all that ample chasm; stair above stair the eddying waters rose, circling immeasurably fast, and laved with alternating dash the gnarlèd roots of mighty trees, that stretched their giant arms in darkness over it. i' the midst was left, reflecting, yet distorting every cloud, a pool of treacherous and tremendous calm. seized by the sway of the ascending stream, with dizzy swiftness, round, and round, and round, ridge after ridge the straining boat arose, till on the verge of the extremest curve, where, through an opening of the rocky bank, the waters overflow, and a smooth spot of glassy quiet mid those battling tides is left, the boat paused shuddering.—shall it sink down the abyss? shall the reverting stress of that resistless gulf embosom it? now shall it fall?—a wandering stream of wind, breathed from the west, has caught the expanded sail, and, lo! with gentle motion, between banks of mossy slope, and on a placid stream, beneath a woven grove it sails, and, hark! the ghastly torrent mingles its far roar, with the breeze murmuring in the musical woods. where the embowering trees recede, and leave a little space of green expanse, the cove is closed by meeting banks, whose yellow flowers for ever gaze on their own drooping eyes, reflected in the crystal calm. the wave of the boat's motion marred their pensive task, which nought but vagrant bird, or wanton wind, or falling spear-grass, or their own decay had e'er disturbed before. the poet longed to deck with their bright hues his withered hair, but on his heart its solitude returned, and he forbore. not the strong impulse hid in those flushed cheeks, bent eyes, and shadowy frame had yet performed its ministry: it hung upon his life, as lightning in a cloud gleams, hovering ere it vanish, ere the floods of night close over it. the noonday sun now shone upon the forest, one vast mass of mingling shade, whose brown magnificence a narrow vale embosoms. there, huge caves scooped in the dark base of their aëry rocks mocking its moans, respond and roar for ever. the meeting boughs and implicated leaves wove twilight o'er the poet's path, as led by love, or dream, or god, or mightier death, he sought in nature's dearest haunt, some bank her cradle, and his sepulchre. more dark and dark the shades accumulate. the oak, expanding its immense and knotty arms, embraces the light beech. the pyramids of the tall cedar overarching, frame most solemn domes within, and far below, like clouds suspended in an emerald sky, the ash and the acacia floating hang tremulous and pale. like restless serpents, clothed in rainbow and in fire, the parasites, starred with ten thousand blossoms, flow around the grey trunks, and, as gamesome infants' eyes, with gentle meanings, and most innocent wiles, fold their beams round the hearts of those that love, these twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs uniting their close union; the woven leaves make net-work of the dark blue light of day, and the night's noontide clearness, mutable as shapes in the weird clouds. soft mossy lawns beneath these canopies extend their swells, fragrant with perfumed herbs, and eyed with blooms minute yet beautiful. one darkest glen sends from its woods of musk-rose, twined with jasmine, a soul-dissolving odour, to invite to some more lovely mystery. through the dell, silence and twilight here, twin-sisters, keep their noonday watch, and sail among the shades, like vaporous shapes half seen; beyond, a well, dark, gleaming, and of most translucent wave, images all the woven boughs above, and each depending leaf, and every speck of azure sky, darting between their chasms; nor aught else in the liquid mirror laves its portraiture, but some inconstant star between one foliaged lattice twinkling fair, or painted bird, sleeping beneath the moon, or gorgeous insect floating motionless, unconscious of the day, ere yet his wings have spread their glories to the gaze of noon. hither the poet came. his eyes beheld their own wan light through the reflected lines of his thin hair, distinct in the dark depth of that still fountain; as the human heart, gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave, sees its own treacherous likeness there. he heard the motion of the leaves, the grass that sprung startled and glanced and trembled even to feel an unaccustomed presence, and the sound of the sweet brook that from the secret springs of that dark fountain rose. a spirit seemed to stand beside him—clothed in no bright robes of shadowy silver or enshrining light, borrowed from aught the visible world affords of grace, or majesty, or mystery;— but, undulating woods, and silent well, and leaping rivulet, and evening gloom now deepening the dark shades, for speech assuming, held commune with him, as if he and it were all that was,—only... when his regard was raised by intense pensiveness,... two eyes, two starry eyes, hung in the gloom of thought, and seemed with their serene and azure smiles to beckon him. obedient to the light that shone within his soul, he went, pursuing the windings of the dell.—the rivulet wanton and wild, through many a green ravine beneath the forest flowed. sometimes it fell among the moss, with hollow harmony dark and profound. now on the polished stones it danced; like childhood laughing as it went: then, through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept, reflecting every herb and drooping bud that overhung its quietness.—""o stream! whose source is inaccessibly profound, whither do thy mysterious waters tend? thou imagest my life. thy darksome stillness, thy dazzling waves, thy loud and hollow gulfs, thy searchless fountain, and invisible course have each their type in me: and the wide sky, and measureless ocean may declare as soon what oozy cavern or what wandering cloud contains thy waters, as the universe tell where these living thoughts reside, when stretched upon thy flowers my bloodless limbs shall waste i' the passing wind!"" beside the grassy shore of the small stream he went; he did impress on the green moss his tremulous step, that caught strong shuddering from his burning limbs. as one roused by some joyous madness from the couch of fever, he did move; yet, not like him, forgetful of the grave, where, when the flame of his frail exultation shall be spent, he must descend. with rapid steps he went beneath the shade of trees, beside the flow of the wild babbling rivulet; and now the forest's solemn canopies were changed for the uniform and lightsome evening sky. grey rocks did peep from the spare moss, and stemmed the struggling brook: tall spires of windlestrae threw their thin shadows down the rugged slope, and nought but gnarlèd roots of ancient pines branchless and blasted, clenched with grasping roots the unwilling soil. a gradual change was here, yet ghastly. for, as fast years flow away, the smooth brow gathers, and the hair grows thin and white, and where irradiate dewy eyes had shone, gleam stony orbs:—so from his steps bright flowers departed, and the beautiful shade of the green groves, with all their odorous winds and musical motions. calm, he still pursued the stream, that with a larger volume now rolled through the labyrinthine dell; and there fretted a path through its descending curves with its wintry speed. on every side now rose rocks, which, in unimaginable forms, lifted their black and barren pinnacles in the light of evening, and its precipice obscuring the ravine, disclosed above, mid toppling stones, black gulfs and yawning caves, whose windings gave ten thousand various tongues to the loud stream. lo! where the pass expands its stony jaws, the abrupt mountain breaks, and seems, with its accumulated crags, to overhang the world: for wide expand beneath the wan stars and descending moon islanded seas, blue mountains, mighty streams, dim tracts and vast, robed in the lustrous gloom of leaden-coloured even, and fiery hills mingling their flames with twilight, on the verge of the remote horizon. the near scene, in naked and severe simplicity, made contrast with the universe. a pine, rock-rooted, stretched athwart the vacancy its swinging boughs, to each inconstant blast yielding one only response, at each pause, in most familiar cadence, with the howl the thunder and the hiss of homeless streams mingling its solemn song, whilst the broad river, foaming and hurrying o'er its rugged path, fell into that immeasurable void, scattering its waters to the passing winds. yet the grey precipice and solemn pine and torrent, were not all;—one silent nook was there. even on the edge of that vast mountain, upheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks, it overlooked in its serenity the dark earth, and the bending vault of stars. it was a tranquil spot, that seemed to smile even in the lap of horror. ivy clasped the fissured stones with its entwining arms, and did embower with leaves for ever green, and berries dark, the smooth and even space of its inviolated floor, and here the children of the autumnal whirlwind bore, in wanton sport, those bright leaves, whose decay, red, yellow, or ethereally pale, rivals the pride of summer. 'tis the haunt of every gentle wind, whose breath can teach the wilds to love tranquillity. one step, one human step alone, has ever broken the stillness of its solitude:—one voice alone inspired its echoes;—even that voice which hither came, floating among the winds, and led the loveliest among human forms to make their wild haunts the depository of all the grace and beauty that endued its motions, render up its majesty, scatter its music on the unfeeling storm, and to the damp leaves and blue cavern mould, nurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss, commit the colours of that varying cheek, that snowy breast, those dark and drooping eyes. the dim and hornèd moon hung low, and poured a sea of lustre on the horizon's verge that overflowed its mountains. yellow mist filled the unbounded atmosphere, and drank wan moonlight even to fulness: not a star shone, not a sound was heard; the very winds, danger's grim playmates, on that precipice slept, clasped in his embrace.—o, storm of death! whose sightless speed divides this sullen night: and thou, colossal skeleton, that, still guiding its irresistible career in thy devastating omnipotence, art king of this frail world, from the red field of slaughter, from the reeking hospital, the patriot's sacred couch, the snowy bed of innocence, the scaffold and the throne, a mighty voice invokes thee. ruin calls his brother death. a rare and regal prey he hath prepared, prowling around the world; glutted with which thou mayst repose, and men go to their graves like flowers or creeping worms, nor ever more offer at thy dark shrine the unheeded tribute of a broken heart. when on the threshold of the green recess the wanderer's footsteps fell, he knew that death was on him. yet a little, ere it fled, did he resign his high and holy soul to images of the majestic past, that paused within his passive being now, like winds that bear sweet music, when they breathe through some dim latticed chamber. he did place his pale lean hand upon the rugged trunk of the old pine. upon an ivied stone reclined his languid head, his limbs did rest, diffused and motionless, on the smooth brink of that obscurest chasm;—and thus he lay, surrendering to their final impulses the hovering powers of life. hope and despair, the torturers, slept; no mortal pain or fear marred his repose, the influxes of sense, and his own being unalloyed by pain, yet feebler and more feeble, calmly fed the stream of thought, till he lay breathing there at peace, and faintly smiling:—his last sight was the great moon, which o'er the western line of the wide world her mighty horn suspended, with whose dun beams inwoven darkness seemed to mingle. now upon the jaggèd hills it rests, and still as the divided frame of the vast meteor sunk, the poet's blood, that ever beat in mystic sympathy with nature's ebb and flow, grew feebler still: and when two lessening points of light alone gleamed through the darkness, the alternate gasp of his faint respiration scarce did stir the stagnate night:—till the minutest ray was quenched, the pulse yet lingered in his heart. it paused—it fluttered. but when heaven remained utterly black, the murky shades involved an image, silent, cold, and motionless, as their own voiceless earth and vacant air. even as a vapour fed with golden beams that ministered on sunlight, ere the west eclipses it, was now that wondrous frame— no sense, no motion, no divinity— a fragile lute, on whose harmonious strings the breath of heaven did wander—a bright stream once fed with many-voicèd waves—a dream of youth, which night and time have quenched for ever, still, dark, and dry, and unremembered now. o, for medea's wondrous alchemy, which wheresoe'er it fell made the earth gleam with bright flowers, and the wintry boughs exhale from vernal blooms fresh fragrance! o, that god, profuse of poisons, would concede the chalice which but one living man has drained, who now, vessel of deathless wrath, a slave that feels no proud exemption in the blighting curse he bears, over the world wanders for ever, lone as incarnate death! o, that the dream of dark magician in his visioned cave, raking the cinders of a crucible for life and power, even when his feeble hand shakes in its last decay, were the true law of this so lovely world! but thou art fled like some frail exhalation; which the dawn robes in its golden beams,—ah! thou hast fled! the brave, the gentle, and the beautiful, the child of grace and genius. heartless things are done and said i' the world, and many worms and beasts and men live on, and mighty earth from sea and mountain, city and wilderness, in vesper low or joyous orison, lifts still its solemn voice:—but thou art fled— thou canst no longer know or love the shapes of this phantasmal scene, who have to thee been purest ministers, who are, alas! now thou art not. upon those pallid lips so sweet even in their silence, on those eyes that image sleep in death, upon that form yet safe from the worm's outrage, let no tear be shed—not even in thought. nor, when those hues are gone, and those divinest lineaments, worn by the senseless wind, shall live alone in the frail pauses of this simple strain, let not high verse, mourning the memory of that which is no more, or painting's woe or sculpture, speak in feeble imagery their own cold powers. art and eloquence, and all the shows o' the world are frail and vain to weep a loss that turns their lights to shade. it is a woe too ""deep for tears,"" when all is reft at once, when some surpassing spirit, whose light adorned the world around it, leaves those who remain behind, not sobs or groans, the passionate tumult of a clinging hope; but pale despair and cold tranquillity, nature's vast frame, the web of human things, birth and the grave, that are not as they were. <line>","living,death,sorrow & grieving,the mind,activities,travels & journeys,nature,landscapes & pastorals,arts & sciences,poetry & poets"

9227,5197,"<line> <line>the clear orange bottle was empty. it had been empty a day.it suddenly seemed so costlyand uncalled for anyway. two years had passed. they had passedmore or less the way years should.maybe he’d changed. or maybethe doctors had misunderstood. it was june. the enormous elm treewas green again, and the scentof hyacinth reached through the windowand followed wherever he went. and the sky was the firmament!his life was never better.each small white spotless cloud that passedwas like a long-wished-for letter. but then he remembered his promise.it came like a mild cramp,and it sat there all day in the back of his mindlike a gas bill awaiting a stamp. he saw three faces that sunday,mother, sister, niece,all with the same kind, brown, scared eyesthat brought him no peace. the sidewalk sparrows were peeping.his whole house smelled like a flower.but he remembered his promise.the drugstore said one hour. back home again, he was tired.the label said caution, said warning.he left the clear orange bottleon the lip of the sink till morning. the insert said warning, said caution.the insert said constipation.it said insomnia, vivid dreams,and hypersalivation, and increased urination, and a spinning sensation. it also said night sweats, andagranulocytosis,and strongly suggested a full glass of waterbe drunk with all doses. the insert said all this,the insert he never read.but he didn’t have to read itto know what it said. the bedroom was calm with moonlightand the breeze through the screen was cooling.through the elm leaves the shivery light on the wallcame like quicksilver pooling.but just before five, something woke him —a close whisper — or maybe a far cry —and the bedroom was queasy with light the colorof lapis lazuli.he lay there listening hardtill six, till seven, till eight ...at nine he remembered the bottle.but nine, nine was too late. “don’t take me!” cried the clozapine.“don’t take me!” cried the pill. by ten he was feeling restless,with a whole day left to kill.“don’t take me!” cried the clozapine.“yes, don’t!” cried the medication. and the bright yellow morning seemed suddenly edgedwith a shady fascination. why should he go to his workplace?who was his supervisor?he had a sickening feelingthat he was becoming wiser.his room filled up with interest.he had begun to think!he thought of the knives in the kitchenand the bottles under the sink.he thought as he switched the stove onor stood at his shaving mirror,or reached for his belt in the wardrobe. thinking made things clearer. even the bedroom window,the open window full of sun,continually hintedat something that should be done.but he was crooked and useless. he was a piece of shit. and so, as everyone knew he would, he failed to go through with it. “don’t take me!” cried the clozapine. “don’t take me!” cried the drug. just then, the telephone rang. just then, he ripped out the plug. “don’t take me!” cried the clozapine. “don’t take me!” cried the poison. and the door of the house creaked open, and the cellar door lilted and murmured, and the garden gate groaned and yawned and let a little noise in. there, just outside his window, lurked life like a cheap cartoon. he shut the sash, locked it, and checked it, and checked it all afternoon. he lowered the blinds on that world, no longer an agent of it, but then, with one finger, pulled down a slat and set his eye above it. at first it was grimly amusing,at last it was grimly grim,to watch all those hunched, hurried people,who made like they weren’t watching him. the neighbors were thinking out loud.they knew he was no fucking good.so he slumped on a stool in the cornerlike a bad little snaggletooth should. they called him a dirty pig, and laughed,and said he shouldn’t exist.sometimes they made a tsking sound,or oinked at him, or hissed. they hissed that he was to blamefor everything, and everyone knew it,and that if he weren’t such a pussyhe’d know what to do, and he’d do it. he lay on his side on the rug unable to move at allexcept for his big right toe, which dug and dug at the wall, which dug at the wall, which dug. “don’t take me!” cried the clozapine.“don’t take me!” cried the cure.and they begged him to sew his mouth shutjust to make goddamn sure. “don’t take me!” cried the clozapine.“don’t take me!” cried the poison.and the gate to the wicked city gaped,and the gates of the temple screamed and screamed,and the gates of the garden groaned and yawned,and the gates of the ziggurat gabbled in grief,and sucked all life’s sorrows and joys in. his thoughts were advancing like wolves.he lay still for an hour and a half,then reared up onto his rickety legslike a newborn calf.then rug hall stairsporch stoop streetand the blacktop humanly warmon the soles of his naked feet.his walk was stiffened by fear, but it took him where he was going,into the terrible world of children and daffodils growing, and friendly people helloing, and the super out doing the mowing, and the two old sisters out in wool sweaters with their wrinkled cheeks pinkly glowing, and the pretty lady who would give birth by christmas barely showing but showing, and the policeman helping to keep the lazy afternoon traffic flowing, and time itself slowing, and none of them, none of them knowingthat an odious axis was forming,that it would not be controlled,that schemes were afoot, that a footwas a thing for a jackboot to hold,that the street was a movie set,that it was not warm and sunny,that a creditor was callingwho could not be paid with money, that the world was like a sliverof iron held in the hand,and his mind the lodestone above itthat made it stir or stand,that the air was slowly changingto a color they didn’t know,that he was a famous doctoron a television show.but what could he do? even friendswould take these facts for lies,and he couldn’t tell who the enemies were,though he felt the hot breath of their eyes,so he kept his big mouth shut and tried to play along,and plowed down the street toward the coffeeshopas if nothing at all were wrong.he tried not to notice the numbers painted on garbage cans.he tried and he tried not to lookat the black unmarked sedans.the coffeeshop smelled like coffee,but it felt different inside.a new waitress went by. she winked. he kept his eyes open wide.everything screamed “run away!”but he wasn’t really there!so he stood by the gumball machinesand smiled and tried not to stare.“the power is yours!” said a t-shirt.“look for lightning!” reported the weather.and the stranger who offered the sports section said,“it’s all there, chief. just put it together.”then wild-eyed out of the kitchenstormed a small, hard old man,shouting in a strange languageand waving a frying pan,shoving him out the doorand into the chattering street,shoving him, waving, shouting, and pointing at his feet, at his bare, gray feet.then came the dark blue uniform,the badge glinting in the sun,and the belt jangling like a storm trooper’sas the boots broke into a run.“take that!” cried the patrolman.“take that!” cried johnny law.street, knee, neck —cuffs, curb, jaw.and the flatfoot pushed him, bleeding, into the sleek cruiser,and he heard all the gawkers thinkingthat he was a pig and a loser,and his chin throbbed,and the handcuffs ate at his wrist,and he would be hacked into pieces soonand would not be missed. “don’t take me!” cried the victim.“don’t take me!” cried the threat.but the angry back of a headwas the only response he could get.lying on his side like a child at the end of a big day,he gazed up through the windowand watched it all slip away.the little pen where they put himhad a toilet but no stall.here and there a messagescarred the gloss-white wall.time passed. but you couldn’t tell iton the trapped fly ticking the ceiling,or the flickering light overhead,or the sore on his chin congealing, or on the sound of the other pigs in the other pens, squealing.when the men came, he was ready.he talked. they took it all down.and soon they were back in the cruiser,on their way across town.then, into the mirrored building,over the waxed lobby floors,down miles of echoing hallways,through the heavy brown doors,into a humming beige roomwith a bed and a river view,and an outside lock, and jailerswho wore white instead of blue.“take that,” smiled the doctor. “take that,” smiled the nurse. he pressed his lips still tighter,and things got worse and worse.“please!” threatened the nurse.“please!” growled the doctor.he raised his fists to cover his mouth,but the nurse was too close, and he clocked her.now into the room came the big men,who did not clamor or shout,but pinned him with ease to the bed,strapped him down, and went out.and the doctor was there again, trailinga spider web of cologne,and the doctor told what would happen next,in an expert monotone,and the nurse took a needleand emptied it into his arm,and they both left, content that he could do no more harm,and he fought, and the straps cut his shoulders, and he gnawed at his lip, and it bled,and he held his bladder for three long hours,then shivered and pissed the bed.when the doctor came a fifth time,it was long past dawn.they’d found him a room, said the doctor,gently restraining a yawn.the next two days were sleep, and words through a fine white mist.then he woke inside a machinewhose motion he couldn’t resist: “tick-tock,” said the clock. “creak, creak,” said the bed. “drip, drip,” said the sink. “throb, throb,” went his head. “ho-hum,” sighed the night nurse. “heh-heh,” said the sicko. “why? why?” screamed the patient. “howl, howl!” cried the psycho. “wolf! wolf!” cried the boy. “gobble, gobble!” sang the freaks. “sa, sa!” cried the king. “tick-tock,” went the weeks. “bang, bang,” said the tv. “teeter-totter,” went his brain. “click, click,” went the checkers. “pitter-patter,” went the rain. “bring-bring,” said the pay phone. “snip, snip,” went fate. “jangle-jingle,” went the keys. “clank-clink,” went the gate. “bye-bye,” said the nurse. “bye-bye,” said the guard. “bar-bar,” said the doctor. “baa-baa,” said the lamb. “my, my,” said his mother. “boohoo!” cried bo peep. “bow-wow,” said the wolf. “baa-baa,” said the sheep.in the car away from that place, the family had a pleasant chat.he seemed fine again, and humble, though his speech was oddly flat.he said that the halfway housewhere he would be residingwas located on a quiet block and hadgreen vinyl siding.there he met new peopleand watched the television,which did not watch him backor speak to him with derision,and he performed certain tasks,meant to teach certain skills,and he got small checks from the governmentto pay his enormous bills.each night he fell asleep, and each morning he got up,and he washed down his medicineand squashed the paper cup, feeling, in all, much better, more in touch with common sense, and also slightly boredby the lack of consequence.and the church bells rangand a dinner bell tinkledand the school bell tolledand called all the good girls and boys in.and all of them brought all their toys in.and all of them swallowed their poison. <line>","living,health & illness,life choices,the

<line>of the man who <line> <line>left in september. <line> <line>his name was law. <line> <line>my face in the bathroom mirror <line> <line>has white streaks down it. <line> <line>i rinse the face and return to bed. <line> <line>tomorrow i am going to visit my mother. <line> <line>she <line> <line>she lives on a moor in the north. <line> <line>she lives alone. <line> <line>spring opens like a blade there. <line> <line>i travel all day on trains and bring a lot of books— <line> <line>some for my mother, some for me <line> <line>including the collected works of emily brontë. <line> <line>this is my favourite author. <line> <line>also my main fear, which i mean to confront. <line> <line>whenever i visit my mother <line> <line>i feel i am turning into emily brontë, <line> <line>my lonely life around me like a moor, <line> <line>my ungainly body stumping over the mud flats with a look of transformation <line> <line>that dies when i come in the kitchen door. <line> <line>what meat is it, emily, we need? <line> <line>three <line> <line>three silent women at the kitchen table. <line> <line>my mother’s kitchen is dark and small but out the window <line> <line>there is the moor, paralyzed with ice. <line> <line>it extends as far as the eye can see <line> <line>over flat miles to a solid unlit white sky. <line> <line>mother and i are chewing lettuce carefully. <line> <line>the kitchen wall clock emits a ragged low buzz that jumps <line> <line>once a minute over the twelve. <line> <line>i have emily p. 216 propped open on the sugarbowl <line> <line>but am covertly watching my mother. <line> <line>a thousand questions hit my eyes from the inside. <line> <line>my mother is studying her lettuce. <line> <line>i turn to p. 217. <line> <line>“in my flight through the kitchen i knocked over hareton <line> <line>who was hanging a litter of puppies <line> <line>from a chairback in the doorway. . . .” <line> <line>it is as if we have all been lowered into an atmosphere of glass. <line> <line>now and then a remark trails through the glass. <line> <line>taxes on the back lot. not a good melon, <line> <line>too early for melons. <line> <line>hairdresser in town found god, closes shop every tuesday. <line> <line>mice in the teatowel drawer again. <line> <line>little pellets. chew off <line> <line>the corners of the napkins, if they knew <line> <line>what paper napkins cost nowadays. <line> <line>rain tonight. <line> <line>rain tomorrow. <line> <line>that volcano in the philippines at it again. what’s her name <line> <line>anderson died no not shirley <line> <line>the opera singer. negress. <line> <line>cancer. <line> <line>not eating your garnish, you don’t like pimento? <line> <line>out the window i can see dead leaves ticking over the flatland <line> <line>and dregs of snow scarred by pine filth. <line> <line>at the middle of the moor <line> <line>where the ground goes down into a depression, <line> <line>the ice has begun to unclench. <line> <line>black open water comes <line> <line>curdling up like anger. my mother speaks suddenly. <line> <line>that psychotherapy’s not doing you much good is it? <line> <line>you aren’t getting over him. <line> <line>my mother has a way of summing things up. <line> <line>she never liked law much <line> <line>but she liked the idea of me having a man and getting on with life. <line> <line>well he’s a taker and you’re a giver i hope it works out, <line> <line>was all she said after she met him. <line> <line>give and take were just words to me <line> <line>at the time. i had not been in love before. <line> <line>it was like a wheel rolling downhill. <line> <line>but early this morning while mother slept <line> <line>and i was downstairs reading the part in wuthering heights <line> <line>where heathcliff clings at the lattice in the storm sobbing <line> <line>come in! come in! to the ghost of his heart’s darling, <line> <line>i fell on my knees on the rug and sobbed too. <line> <line>she knows how to hang puppies, <line> <line>that emily. <line> <line>it isn’t like taking an aspirin you know, i answer feebly. <line> <line>dr. haw says grief is a long process. <line> <line>she frowns. what does it accomplish <line> <line>all that raking up the past? <line> <line>oh—i spread my hands— <line> <line>i prevail! i look her in the eye. <line> <line>she grins. yes you do. <line> <line>whacher <line> <line>whacher, <line> <line>emily’s habitual spelling of this word, <line> <line>has caused confusion. <line> <line>for example <line> <line>in the first line of the poem printed tell me, whether, is it winter? <line> <line>in the shakespeare head edition. <line> <line>but whacher is what she wrote. <line> <line>whacher is what she was. <line> <line>she whached god and humans and moor wind and open night. <line> <line>she whached eyes, stars, inside, outside, actual weather. <line> <line>she whached the bars of time, which broke. <line> <line>she whached the poor core of the world, <line> <line>wide open. <line> <line>to be a whacher is not a choice. <line> <line>there is nowhere to get away from it, <line> <line>no ledge to climb up to—like a swimmer <line> <line>who walks out of the water at sunset <line> <line>shaking the drops off, it just flies open. <line> <line>to be a whacher is not in itself sad or happy, <line> <line>although she uses these words in her verse <line> <line>as she uses the emotions of sexual union in her novel, <line> <line>grazing with euphemism the work of whaching. <line> <line>but it has no name. <line> <line>it is transparent. <line> <line>sometimes she calls it thou. <line> <line>“emily is in the parlour brushing the carpet,” <line> <line>records charlotte in 1828. <line> <line>unsociable even at home <line> <line>and unable to meet the eyes of strangers when she ventured out, <line> <line>emily made her awkward way <line> <line>across days and years whose bareness appalls her biographers. <line> <line>this sad stunted life, says one. <line> <line>uninteresting, unremarkable, wracked by disappointment <line> <line>and despair, says another. <line> <line>she could have been a great navigator if she’d been male, <line> <line>suggests a third. meanwhile <line> <line>emily continued to brush into the carpet the question, <line> <line>why cast the world away. <line> <line>for someone hooked up to thou, <line> <line>the world may have seemed a kind of half-finished sentence. <line> <line>but in between the neighbour who recalls her <line> <line>coming in from a walk on the moors <line> <line>with her face “lit up by a divine light” <line> <line>and the sister who tells us <line> <line>emily never made a friend in her life, <line> <line>is a space where the little raw soul <line> <line>slips through. <line> <line>it goes skimming the deep keel like a storm petrel, <line> <line>out of sight. <line> <line>the little raw soul was caught by no one. <line> <line>she didn’t have friends, children, sex, religion, marriage, success, a salary <line> <line>or a fear of death. she worked <line> <line>in total six months of her life (at a school in halifax) <line> <line>and died on the sofa at home at 2 p.m. on a winter afternoon <line> <line>in her thirty-first year. she spent <line> <line>most of the hours of her life brushing the carpet, <line> <line>walking the moor <line> <line>or whaching. she says <line> <line>it gave her peace. <line> <line>“all tight and right in which condition it is to be hoped we shall all be this <line> <line> day 4 years,” <line> <line>she wrote in her diary paper of 1837. <line> <line>yet her poetry from beginning to end is concerned with prisons, <line> <line>vaults, cages, bars, curbs, bits, bolts, fetters, <line> <line>locked windows, narrow frames, aching walls. <line> <line>“why all the fuss?” asks one critic. <line> <line>“she wanted liberty. well didn’t she have it? <line> <line>a reasonably satisfactory homelife, <line> <line>a most satisfactory dreamlife—why all this beating of wings? <line> <line>what was this cage, invisible to us, <line> <line>which she felt herself to be confined in?” <line> <line>well there are many ways of being held prisoner, <line> <line>i am thinking as i stride over the moor. <line> <line>as a rule after lunch mother has a nap <line> <line>and i go out to walk. <line> <line>the bare blue trees and bleached wooden sky of april <line> <line>carve into me with knives of light. <line> <line>something inside it reminds me of childhood— <line> <line>it is the light of the stalled time after lunch <line> <line>when clocks tick <line> <line>and hearts shut <line> <line>and fathers leave to go back to work <line> <line>and mothers stand at the kitchen sink pondering <line> <line>something they never tell. <line> <line>you remember too much, <line> <line>my mother said to me recently. <line> <line>why hold onto all that? and i said, <line> <line>where can i put it down? <line> <line>she shifted to a question about airports. <line> <line>crops of ice are changing to mud all around me <line> <line>as i push on across the moor <line> <line>warmed by drifts from the pale blue sun. <line> <line>on the edge of the moor our pines <line> <line>dip and coast in breezes <line> <line>from somewhere else. <line> <line>perhaps the hardest thing about losing a lover is <line> <line>to watch the year repeat its days. <line> <line>it is as if i could dip my hand down <line> <line>into time and scoop up <line> <line>blue and green lozenges of april heat <line> <line>a year ago in another country. <line> <line>i can feel that other day running underneath this one <line> <line>like an old videotape—here we go fast around the last corner <line> <line>up the hill to his house, shadows <line> <line>of limes and roses blowing in the car window <line> <line>and music spraying from the radio and him <line> <line>singing and touching my left hand to his lips. <line> <line>law lived in a high blue room from which he could see the sea. <line> <line>time in its transparent loops as it passes beneath me now <line> <line>still carries the sound of the telephone in that room <line> <line>and traffic far off and doves under the window <line> <line>chuckling coolly and his voice saying, <line> <line>you beauty. i can feel that beauty’s <line> <line>heart beating inside mine as she presses into his arms in the high blue room— <line> <line>no, i say aloud. i force my arms down <line> <line>through air which is suddenly cold and heavy as water <line> <line>and the videotape jerks to a halt <line> <line>like a glass slide under a drop of blood. <line> <line>i stop and turn and stand into the wind, <line> <line>which now plunges towards me over the moor. <line> <line>when law left i felt so bad i thought i would die. <line> <line>this is not uncommon. <line> <line>i took up the practice of meditation. <line> <line>each morning i sat on the floor in front of my sofa <line> <line>and chanted bits of old latin prayers.de profundis clamavi ad te domine. <line> <line>each morning a vision came to me. <line> <line>gradually i understood that these were naked glimpses of my soul. <line> <line>i called them nudes. <line> <line>nude #1. woman alone on a hill. <line> <line>she stands into the wind. <line> <line>it is a hard wind slanting from the north. <line> <line>long flaps and shreds of flesh rip off the woman’s body and lift <line> <line>and blow away on the wind, leaving <line> <line>an exposed column of nerve and blood and muscle <line> <line>calling mutely through lipless mouth. <line> <line>it pains me to record this, <line> <line>i am not a melodramatic person. <line> <line>but soul is “hewn in a wild workshop” <line> <line>as charlotte brontë says of wuthering heights. <line> <line>charlotte’s preface to wuthering heights is a publicist’s masterpiece. <line> <line>like someone carefully not looking at a scorpion <line> <line>crouched on the arm of the sofa charlotte <line> <line>talks firmly and calmly <line> <line>about the other furniture of emily’s workshop—about <line> <line>the inexorable spirit (“stronger than a man, simpler than a child”), <line> <line>the cruel illness (“pain no words can render”), <line> <line>the autonomous end (“she sank rapidly, she made haste to leave us”) <line> <line>and about emily’s total subjection <line> <line>to a creative project she could neither understand nor control, <line> <line>and for which she deserves no more praise nor blame <line> <line>than if she had opened her mouth <line> <line>“to breathe lightning.” the scorpion is inching down <line> <line>the arm of the sofa while charlotte <line> <line>continues to speak helpfully about lightning <line> <line>and other weather we may expect to experience <line> <line>when we enter emily’s electrical atmosphere. <line> <line>it is “a horror of great darkness” that awaits us there <line> <line>but emily is not responsible. emily was in the grip. <line> <line>“having formed these beings she did not know what she had done,” <line> <line>says charlotte (of heathcliff and earnshaw and catherine). <line> <line>well there are many ways of being held prisoner. <line> <line>the scorpion takes a light spring and lands on our left knee <line> <line>as charlotte concludes, “on herself she had no pity.” <line> <line>pitiless too are the heights, which emily called wuthering <line> <line>because of their “bracing ventilation” <line> <line>and “a north wind over the edge.” <line> <line>whaching a north wind grind the moor <line> <line>that surrounded her father’s house on every side, <line> <line>formed of a kind of rock called millstone grit, <line> <line>taught emily all she knew about love and its necessities— <line> <line>an angry education that shapes the way her characters <line> <line>use one another. “my love for heathcliff,” says catherine, <line> <line>“resembles the eternal rocks beneath <line> <line>a source of little visible delight, but necessary.” <line> <line>necessary? i notice the sun has dimmed <line> <line>and the afternoon air sharpening. <line> <line>i turn and start to recross the moor towards home. <line> <line>what are the imperatives <line> <line>that hold people like catherine and heathcliff <line> <line>together and apart, like pores blown into hot rock <line> <line>and then stranded out of reach <line> <line>of one another when it hardens? what kind of necessity is that? <line> <line>the last time i saw law was a black night in september. <line> <line>autumn had begun, <line> <line>my knees were cold inside my clothes. <line> <line>a chill fragment of moon rose. <line> <line>he stood in my living room and spoke <line> <line>without looking at me. not enough spin on it, <line> <line>he said of our five years of love. <line> <line>inside my chest i felt my heart snap into two pieces <line> <line>which floated apart. by now i was so cold <line> <line>it was like burning. i put out my hand <line> <line>to touch his. he moved back. <line> <line>i don’t want to be sexual with you, he said. everything gets crazy. <line> <line>but now he was looking at me. <line> <line>yes, i said as i began to remove my clothes. <line> <line>everything gets crazy. when nude <line> <line>i turned my back because he likes the back. <line> <line>he moved onto me. <line> <line>everything i know about love and its necessities <line> <line>i learned in that one moment <line> <line>when i found myself <line> <line>thrusting my little burning red backside like a baboon <line> <line>at a man who no longer cherished me. <line> <line>there was no area of my mind <line> <line>not appalled by this action, no part of my body <line> <line>that could have done otherwise. <line> <line>but to talk of mind and body begs the question. <line> <line>soul is the place, <line> <line>stretched like a surface of millstone grit between body and mind, <line> <line>where such necessity grinds itself out. <line> <line>soul is what i kept watch on all that night. <line> <line>law stayed with me. <line> <line>we lay on top of the covers as if it weren’t really a night of sleep and time, <line> <line>caressing and singing to one another in our made-up language <line> <line>like the children we used to be. <line> <line>that was a night that centred heaven and hell, <line> <line>as emily would say. we tried to fuck <line> <line>but he remained limp, although happy. i came <line> <line>again and again, each time accumulating lucidity, <line> <line>until at last i was floating high up near the ceiling looking down <line> <line>on the two souls clasped there on the bed <line> <line>with their mortal boundaries <line> <line>visible around them like lines on a map. <line> <line>i saw the lines harden. <line> <line>he left in the morning. <line> <line>it is very cold <line> <line>walking into the long scraped april wind. <line> <line>at this time of year there is no sunset <line> <line>just some movements inside the light and then a sinking away. <line> <line>kitchen <line> <line>kitchen is quiet as a bone when i come in. <line> <line>no sound from the rest of the house. <line> <line>i wait a moment <line> <line>then open the fridge. <line> <line>brilliant as a spaceship it exhales cold confusion. <line> <line>my mother lives alone and eats little but her fridge is always crammed. <line> <line>after extracting the yogurt container <line> <line>from beneath a wily arrangement of leftover blocks of christmas cake <line> <line>wrapped in foil and prescription medicine bottles <line> <line>i close the fridge door. bluish dusk <line> <line>fills the room like a sea slid back. <line> <line>i lean against the sink. <line> <line>white foods taste best to me <line> <line>and i prefer to eat alone. i don’t know why. <line> <line>once i heard girls singing a may day song that went: <line> <line> violante in the pantry <line> <line> gnawing at a mutton bone <line> <line> how she gnawed it <line> <line> how she clawed it <line> <line> when she felt herself alone. <line> <line>girls are cruelest to themselves. <line> <line>someone like emily brontë, <line> <line>who remained a girl all her life despite her body as a woman, <line> <line>had cruelty drifted up in all the cracks of her like spring snow. <line> <line>we can see her ridding herself of it at various times <line> <line>with a gesture like she used to brush the carpet. <line> <line>reason with him and then whip him! <line> <line>was her instruction (age six) to her father <line> <line>regarding brother branwell. <line> <line>and when she was 14 and bitten by a rabid dog she strode (they say) <line> <line>into the kitchen and taking red hot tongs from the back of the stove applied <line> <line>them directly to her arm. <line> <line>cauterization of heathcliff took longer. <line> <line>more than thirty years in the time of the novel, <line> <line>from the april evening when he runs out the back door of the kitchen <line> <line>and vanishes over the moor <line> <line>because he overheard half a sentence of catherine’s <line> <line>(“it would degrade me to marry heathcliff”) <line> <line>until the wild morning <line> <line>when the servant finds him stark dead and grinning <line> <line>on his rainsoaked bed upstairs in wuthering heights. <line> <line>heathcliff is a pain devil. <line> <line>if he had stayed in the kitchen <line> <line>long enough to hear the other half of catherine’s sentence <line> <line>(“so he will never know how i love him”) <line> <line>heathcliff would have been set free. <line> <line>but emily knew how to catch a devil. <line> <line>she put into him in place of a soul <line> <line>the constant cold departure of catherine from his nervous system <line> <line>every time he drew a breath or moved thought. <line> <line>she broke all his moments in half, <line> <line>with the kitchen door standing open. <line> <line>i am not unfamiliar with this half-life. <line> <line>but there is more to it than that. <line> <line>heathcliff’s sexual despair <line> <line>arose out of no such experience in the life of emily brontë, <line> <line>so far as we know. her question, <line> <line>which concerns the years of inner cruelty that can twist a person into a pain <line> <line> devil, <line> <line>came to her in a kindly firelit kitchen <line> <line>(“kichin” in emily’s spelling) where she <line> <line>and charlotte and anne peeled potatoes together <line> <line>and made up stories with the old house dog keeper at their feet. <line> <line>there is a fragment <line> <line>of a poem she wrote in 1839 <line> <line>(about six years before wuthering heights) that says: <line> <line> that iron man was born like me <line> <line> and he was once an ardent boy: <line> <line> he must have felt in infancy <line> <line> the glory of a summer sky. <line> <line>who is the iron man? <line> <line>my mother’s voice cuts across me, <line> <line>from the next room where she is lying on the sofa. <line> <line>is that you dear? <line> <line>yes ma. <line> <line>why don’t you turn on a light in there? <line> <line>out the kitchen window i watch the steely april sun <line> <line>jab its last cold yellow streaks <line> <line>across a dirty silver sky. <line> <line>okay ma. what’s for supper? <line> <line>liberty <line> <line>liberty means different things to different people. <line> <line>i have never liked lying in bed in the morning. <line> <line>law did. <line> <line>my mother does. <line> <line>but as soon as the morning light hits my eyes i want to be out in it— <line> <line>moving along the moor <line> <line>into the first blue currents and cold navigation of everything awake. <line> <line>i hear my mother in the next room turn and sigh and sink deeper. <line> <line>i peel the stale cage of sheets off my legs <line> <line>and i am free. <line> <line>out on the moor all is brilliant and hard after a night of frost. <line> <line>the light plunges straight up from the ice to a blue hole at the top of the sky. <line> <line>frozen mud crunches underfoot. the sound <line> <line>startles me back into the dream i was having <line> <line>this morning when i awoke, <line> <line>one of those nightlong sweet dreams of lying in law’s <line> <line>arms like a needle in water—it is a physical effort <line> <line>to pull myself out of his white silk hands <line> <line>as they slide down my dream hips—i <line> <line>turn and face into the wind <line> <line>and begin to run. <line> <line>goblins, devils and death stream behind me. <line> <line>in the days and months after law left <line> <line>i felt as if the sky was torn off my life. <line> <line>i had no home in goodness anymore. <line> <line>to see the love between law and me <line> <line>turn into two animals gnawing and craving through one another <line> <line>towards some other hunger was terrible. <line> <line>perhaps this is what people mean by original sin, i thought. <line> <line>but what love could be prior to it? <line> <line>what is prior? <line> <line>what is love? <line> <line>my questions were not original. <line> <line>nor did i answer them. <line> <line>mornings when i meditated <line> <line>i was presented with a nude glimpse of my lone soul, <line> <line>not the complex mysteries of love and hate. <line> <line>but the nudes are still as clear in my mind <line> <line>as pieces of laundry that froze on the clothesline overnight. <line> <line>there were in all thirteen of them. <line> <line>nude #2. woman caught in a cage of thorns. <line> <line>big glistening brown thorns with black stains on them <line> <line>where she twists this way and that way <line> <line>unable to stand upright. <line> <line>nude #3. woman with a single great thorn implanted in her forehead. <line> <line>she grips it in both hands <line> <line>endeavouring to wrench it out. <line> <line>nude #4. woman on a blasted landscape <line> <line>backlit in red like hieronymus bosch. <line> <line>covering her head and upper body is a hellish contraption <line> <line>like the top half of a crab. <line> <line>with arms crossed as if pulling off a sweater <line> <line>she works hard at dislodging the crab. <line> <line>it was about this time <line> <line>i began telling dr. haw <line> <line>about the nudes. she said, <line> <line>when you see these horrible images why do you stay with them? <line> <line>why keep watching? why not <line> <line>go away? i was amazed. <line> <line>go away where? i said. <line> <line>this still seems to me a good question. <line> <line>but by now the day is wide open and a strange young april light <line> <line>is filling the moor with gold milk. <line> <line>i have reached the middle <line> <line>where the ground goes down into a depression and fills with swampy water. <line> <line>it is frozen. <line> <line>a solid black pane of moor life caught in its own night attitudes. <line> <line>certain wild gold arrangements of weed are visible deep in the black. <line> <line>four naked alder trunks rise straight up from it <line> <line>and sway in the blue air. each trunk <line> <line>where it enters the ice radiates a map of silver pressures— <line> <line>thousands of hair-thin cracks catching the white of the light <line> <line>like a jailed face <line> <line>catching grins through the bars. <line> <line>emily brontë has a poem about a woman in jail who says <line> <line> a messenger of hope, comes every night to me <line> <line> and offers, for short life, eternal liberty. <line> <line>i wonder what kind of liberty this is. <line> <line>her critics and commentators say she means death <line> <line>or a visionary experience that prefigures death. <line> <line>they understand her prison <line> <line>as the limitations placed on a clergyman’s daughter <line> <line>by nineteenth-century life in a remote parish on a cold moor <line> <line>in the north of england. <line> <line>they grow impatient with the extreme terms in which she figures prison life. <line> <line>“in so much of brontë’s work <line> <line>the self-dramatising and posturing of these poems teeters <line> <line>on the brink of a potentially bathetic melodrama,” <line> <line>says one. another <line> <line>refers to “the cardboard sublime” of her caught world. <line> <line>i stopped telling my psychotherapist about the nudes <line> <line>when i realized i had no way to answer her question, <line> <line>why keep watching? <line> <line>some people watch, that’s all i can say. <line> <line>there is nowhere else to go, <line> <line>no ledge to climb up to. <line> <line>perhaps i can explain this to her if i wait for the right moment, <line> <line>as with a very difficult sister. <line> <line>“on that mind time and experience alone could work: <line> <line>to the influence of other intellects it was not amenable,” <line> <line>wrote charlotte of emily. <line> <line>i wonder what kind of conversation these two had <line> <line>over breakfast at the parsonage. <line> <line>“my sister emily <line> <line>was not a person of demonstrative character,” charlotte emphasizes, <line> <line>“nor one on the recesses of whose mind and feelings, <line> <line>even those nearest and dearest to her could, <line> <line>with impunity, intrude unlicensed. . . .” recesses were many. <line> <line>one autumn day in 1845 charlotte <line> <line>“accidentally lighted on a ms. volume of verse in my sister emily’s <line> <line> handwriting.” <line> <line>it was a small (4 x 6) notebook <line> <line>with a dark red cover marked 6d. <line> <line>and contained 44 poems in emily’s minute hand. <line> <line>charlotte had known emily wrote verse <line> <line>but felt “more than surprise” at its quality. <line> <line>“not at all like the poetry women generally write.” <line> <line>further surprise awaited charlotte when she read emily’s novel, <line> <line>not least for its foul language. <line> <line>she gently probes this recess <line> <line>in her editor’s preface to wuthering heights. <line> <line>“a large class of readers, likewise, will suffer greatly <line> <line>from the introduction into the pages of this work <line> <line>of words printed with all their letters, <line> <line>which it has become the custom to represent by the initial and final letter <line> <line> only—a blank <line> <line>line filling the interval.” <line> <line>well, there are different definitions of liberty. <line> <line>love is freedom, law was fond of saying. <line> <line>i took this to be more a wish than a thought <line> <line>and changed the subject. <line> <line>but blank lines do not say nothing. <line> <line>as charlotte puts it, <line> <line>“the practice of hinting by single letters those expletives <line> <line>with which profane and violent persons are wont to garnish their discourse, <line> <line>strikes me as a proceeding which, <line> <line>however well meant, is weak and futile. <line> <line>i cannot tell what good it does—what feeling it spares— <line> <line>what horror it conceals.” <line> <line>i turn my steps and begin walking back over the moor <line> <line>towards home and breakfast. it is a two-way traffic, <line> <line>the language of the unsaid. my favourite pages <line> <line>of the collected works of emily brontë <line> <line>are the notes at the back <line> <line>recording small adjustments made by charlotte <line> <line>to the text of emily’s verse, <line> <line>which charlotte edited for publication after emily’s death. <line> <line>“prison for strongest [in emily’s hand] altered to lordly by charlotte.” <line> <line>hero <line> <line>i can tell by the way my mother chews her toast <line> <line>whether she had a good night <line> <line>and is about to say a happy thing <line> <line>or not. <line> <line>not. <line> <line>she puts her toast down on the side of her plate. <line> <line>you know you can pull the drapes in that room, she begins. <line> <line>this is a coded reference to one of our oldest arguments, <line> <line>from what i call the rules of life series. <line> <line>my mother always closes her bedroom drapes tight before going to bed at night. <line> <line>i open mine as wide as possible. <line> <line>i like to see everything, i say. <line> <line>what’s there to see? <line> <line>moon. air. sunrise. <line> <line>all that light on your face in the morning. wakes you up. <line> <line>i like to wake up. <line> <line>at this point the drapes argument has reached a delta <line> <line>and may advance along one of three channels. <line> <line>there is the what you need is a good night’s sleep channel, <line> <line>the stubborn as your father channel <line> <line>and random channel. <line> <line>more toast? i interpose strongly, pushing back my chair. <line> <line>those women! says my mother with an exasperated rasp. <line> <line>mother has chosen random channel. <line> <line>women? <line> <line>complaining about rape all the time <line> <line>i see she is tapping one furious finger on yesterday’s newspaper <line> <line>lying beside the grape jam. <line> <line>the front page has a small feature <line> <line>about a rally for international women’s day— <line> <line>have you had a look at the sears summer catalogue? <line> <line>nope. <line> <line>why, it’s a disgrace! those bathing suits— <line> <line>cut way up to here! (she points) no wonder! <line> <line>you’re saying women deserve to get raped <line> <line>because sears bathing suit ads <line> <line>have high-cut legs? ma, are you serious? <line> <line>well someone has to be responsible. <line> <line>why should women be responsible for male desire? my voice is high. <line> <line>oh i see you’re one of them. <line> <line>one of whom? my voice is very high. mother vaults it. <line> <line>and whatever did you do with that little tank suit you had last year the green <line> <line> one? <line> <line>it looked so smart on you. <line> <line>the frail fact drops on me from a great height <line> <line>that my mother is afraid. <line> <line>she will be eighty years old this summer. <line> <line>her tiny sharp shoulders hunched in the blue bathrobe <line> <line>make me think of emily brontë’s little merlin hawk hero <line> <line>that she fed bits of bacon at the kitchen table when charlotte wasn‘t around. <line> <line>so ma, we’ll go—i pop up the toaster <line> <line>and toss a hot slice of pumpernickel lightly across onto her plate— <line> <line>visit dad today? she eyes the kitchen clock with hostility. <line> <line>leave at eleven, home again by four? i continue. <line> <line>she is buttering her toast with jagged strokes. <line> <line>silence is assent in our code. i go into the next room to phone the taxi. <line> <line>my father lives in a hospital for patients who need chronic care <line> <line>about 50 miles from here. <line> <line>he suffers from a kind of dementia <line> <line>characterized by two sorts of pathological change <line> <line>first recorded in 1907 by alois alzheimer. <line> <line>first, the presence in cerebral tissue <line> <line>of a spherical formation known as neuritic plaque, <line> <line>consisting mainly of degenerating brain cells. <line> <line>second, neurofibrillary snarlings <line> <line>in the cerebral cortex and in the hippocampus. <line> <line>there is no known cause or cure. <line> <line>mother visits him by taxi once a week <line> <line>for the last five years. <line> <line>marriage is for better or for worse, she says, <line> <line>this is the worse. <line> <line>so about an hour later we are in the taxi <line> <line>shooting along empty country roads towards town. <line> <line>the april light is clear as an alarm. <line> <line>as we pass them it gives a sudden sense of every object <line> <line>existing in space on its own shadow. <line> <line>i wish i could carry this clarity with me <line> <line>into the hospital where distinctions tend to flatten and coalesce. <line> <line>i wish i had been nicer to him before he got crazy. <line> <line>these are my two wishes. <line> <line>it is hard to find the beginning of dementia. <line> <line>i remember a night about ten years ago <line> <line>when i was talking to him on the telephone. <line> <line>it was a sunday night in winter. <line> <line>i heard his sentences filling up with fear. <line> <line>he would start a sentence—about weather, lose his way, start another. <line> <line>it made me furious to hear him floundering— <line> <line>my tall proud father, former world war ii navigator! <line> <line>it made me merciless. <line> <line>i stood on the edge of the conversation, <line> <line>watching him thrash about for cues, <line> <line>offering none, <line> <line>and it came to me like a slow avalanche <line> <line>that he had no idea who he was talking to. <line> <line>much colder today i guess. . . . <line> <line>his voice pressed into the silence and broke off, <line> <line>snow falling on it. <line> <line>there was a long pause while snow covered us both. <line> <line>well i won’t keep you, <line> <line>he said with sudden desperate cheer as if sighting land. <line> <line>i’ll say goodnight now, <line> <line>i won’t run up your bill. goodbye. <line> <line>goodbye. <line> <line>goodbye. who are you? <line> <line>i said into the dial tone. <line> <line>at the hospital we pass down long pink halls <line> <line>through a door with a big window <line> <line>and a combination lock (5—25—3) <line> <line>to the west wing, for chronic care patients. <line> <line>each wing has a name. <line> <line>the chronic wing is our golden mile <line> <line>although mother prefers to call it the last lap. <line> <line>father sits strapped in a chair which is tied to the wall <line> <line>in a room of other tied people tilting at various angles. <line> <line>my father tilts least, i am proud of him. <line> <line>hi dad how y’doing? <line> <line>his face cracks open it could be a grin or rage <line> <line>and looking past me he issues a stream of vehemence at the air. <line> <line>my mother lays her hand on his. <line> <line>hello love, she says. he jerks his hand away. we sit. <line> <line>sunlight flocks through the room. <line> <line>mother begins to unpack from her handbag the things she has brought for him, <line> <line>grapes, arrowroot biscuits, humbugs. <line> <line>he is addressing strenuous remarks to someone in the air between us. <line> <line>he uses a language known only to himself, <line> <line>made of snarls and syllables and sudden wild appeals. <line> <line>once in a while some old formula floats up through the wash— <line> <line>you don’t say! or happy birthday to you!— <line> <line>but no real sentence <line> <line>for more than three years now. <line> <line>i notice his front teeth are getting black. <line> <line>i wonder how you clean the teeth of mad people. <line> <line>he always took good care of his teeth. my mother looks up. <line> <line>she and i often think two halves of one thought. <line> <line>do you remember that gold-plated toothpick <line> <line>you sent him from harrod’s the summer you were in london? she asks. <line> <line>yes i wonder what happened to it. <line> <line>must be in the bathroom somewhere. <line> <line>she is giving him grapes one by one. <line> <line>they keep rolling out of his huge stiff fingers. <line> <line>he used to be a big man, over six feet tall and strong, <line> <line>but since he came to hospital his body has shrunk to the merest bone house— <line> <line>except the hands. the hands keep growing. <line> <line>each one now as big as a boot in van gogh, <line> <line>they go lumbering after the grapes in his lap. <line> <line>but now he turns to me with a rush of urgent syllables <line> <line>that break off on a high note—he waits, <line> <line>staring into my face. that quizzical look. <line> <line>one eyebrow at an angle. <line> <line>i have a photograph taped to my fridge at home. <line> <line>it shows his world war ii air crew posing in front of the plane. <line> <line>hands firmly behind backs, legs wide apart, <line> <line>chins forward. <line> <line>dressed in the puffed flying suits <line> <line>with a wide leather strap pulled tight through the crotch. <line> <line>they squint into the brilliant winter sun of 1942. <line> <line>it is dawn. <line> <line>they are leaving dover for france. <line> <line>my father on the far left is the tallest airman, <line> <line>with his collar up, <line> <line>one eyebrow at an angle. <line> <line>the shadowless light makes him look immortal, <line> <line>for all the world like someone who will not weep again. <line> <line>he is still staring into my face. <line> <line>flaps down! i cry. <line> <line>his black grin flares once and goes out like a match. <line> <line>hot <line> <line>hot blue moonlight down the steep sky. <line> <line>i wake too fast from a cellar of hanged puppies <line> <line>with my eyes pouring into the dark. <line> <line>fumbling <line> <line>and slowly <line> <line>consciousness replaces the bars. <line> <line>dreamtails and angry liquids <line> <line>swim back down to the middle of me. <line> <line>it is generally anger dreams that occupy my nights now. <line> <line>this is not uncommon after loss of love— <line> <line>blue and black and red blasting the crater open. <line> <line>i am interested in anger. <line> <line>i clamber along to find the source. <line> <line>my dream was of an old woman lying awake in bed. <line> <line>she controls the house by a system of light bulbs strung above her on wires. <line> <line>each wire has a little black switch. <line> <line>one by one the switches refuse to turn the bulbs on. <line> <line>she keeps switching and switching <line> <line>in rising tides of very hot anger. <line> <line>then she creeps out of bed to peer through lattices <line> <line>at the rooms of the rest of the house. <line> <line>the rooms are silent and brilliantly lit <line> <line>and full of huge furniture beneath which crouch <line> <line>small creatures—not quite cats not quite rats <line> <line>licking their narrow red jaws <line> <line>under a load of time. <line> <line>i want to be beautiful again, she whispers <line> <line>but the great overlit rooms tick emptily <line> <line>as a deserted oceanliner and now behind her in the dark <line> <line>a rustling sound, comes— <line> <line>my pajamas are soaked. <line> <line>anger travels through me, pushes aside everything else in my heart, <line> <line>pouring up the vents. <line> <line>every night i wake to this anger, <line> <line>the soaked bed, <line> <line>the hot pain box slamming me each way i move. <line> <line>i want justice. slam. <line> <line>i want an explanation. slam. <line> <line>i want to curse the false friend who said i love you forever. slam. <line> <line>i reach up and switch on the bedside lamp. night springs <line> <line>out the window and is gone over the moor. <line> <line>i lie listening to the light vibrate in my ears <line> <line>and thinking about curses. <line> <line>emily brontë was good at cursing. <line> <line>falsity and bad love and the deadly pain of alteration are constant topics in <line> <line> her verse. <line> <line> well, thou halt paid me back my love! <line> <line> but if there be a god above <line> <line> whose arm is strong, whose word is true, <line> <line> this hell shall wring thy spirit too! <line> <line>the curses are elaborate: <line> <line> there go, deceiver, go! my hand is streaming wet; <line> <line> my heart’s blood flows to buy the blessing—to forget! <line> <line> oh could that lost heart give back, back again to thine, <line> <line> one tenth part of the pain that clouds my dark decline! <line> <line>but they do not bring her peace: <line> <line> vain words, vain frenzied thoughts! no ear can hear me call— <line> <line> lost in the vacant air my frantic curses fall. . . . <line> <line> unconquered in my soul the tyrant rules me still— <line> <line> life bows to my control, but love i cannot kill! <line> <line>her anger is a puzzle. <line> <line>it raises many questions in me, <line> <line>to see love treated with such cold and knowing contempt <line> <line>by someone who rarely left home <line> <line>“except to go to church or take a walk on the hills” <line> <line>(charlotte tells us) and who <line> <line>had no more intercourse with haworth folk <line> <line>than “a nun has <line> <line>of the country people who sometimes pass her convent gates.” <line> <line>how did emily come to lose faith in humans? <line> <line>she admired their dialects, studied their genealogies, <line> <line>“but with them she rarely exchanged a word.” <line> <line>her introvert nature shrank from shaking hands with someone she met on the moor. <line> <line>what did emily know of lover’s lies or cursive human faith? <line> <line>among her biographers <line> <line>is one who conjectures she bore or aborted a child <line> <line>during her six-month stay in halifax, <line> <line>but there is no evidence at all for such an event <line> <line>and the more general consensus is that emily did not touch a man in her 31 <line> <line> years. <line> <line>banal sexism aside, <line> <line>i find myself tempted <line> <line>to read wuthering heights as one thick stacked act of revenge <line> <line>for all that life withheld from emily. <line> <line>but the poetry shows traces of a deeper explanation. <line> <line>as if anger could be a kind of vocation for some women. <line> <line>it is a chilly thought. <line> <line> <line> <line> the heart is dead since infancy. <line> <line> unwept for let the body go. <line> <line>suddenly cold i reach down and pull the blanket back up to my chin. <line> <line>the vocation of anger is not mine. <line> <line>i know my source. <line> <line>it is stunning, it is a moment like no other, <line> <line>when one’s lover comes in and says i do not love you anymore. <line> <line>i switch off the lamp and lie on my back, <line> <line>thinking about emily’s cold young soul. <line> <line>where does unbelief begin? <line> <line>when i was young <line> <line>there were degrees of certainty. <line> <line>i could say, yes i know that i have two hands. <line> <line>then one day i awakened on a planet of people whose hands occasionally <line> <line> disappear— <line> <line>from the next room i hear my mother shift and sigh and settle <line> <line>back down under the doorsill of sleep. <line> <line>out the window the moon is just a cold bit of silver gristle low on fading banks <line> <line> of sky. <line> <line> our guests are darkly lodged, i whispered, gazing through <line> <line> the vault . . . <line> <line>thou <line> <line>the question i am left with is the question of her loneliness. <line> <line>and i prefer to put it off. <line> <line>it is morning. <line> <line>astonished light is washing over the moor from north to east. <line> <line>i am walking into the light. <line> <line>one way to put off loneliness is to interpose god. <line> <line>emily had a relationship on this level with someone she calls thou. she describes thou as awake like herself all night <line> <line>and full of strange power. <line> <line>thou woos emily with a voice that comes out of the night wind. <line> <line>thou and emily influence one another in the darkness, <line> <line>playing near and far at once. <line> <line>she talks about a sweetness that “proved us one.” <line> <line>i am uneasy with the compensatory model of female religious experience and yet, <line> <line>there is no question, <line> <line>it would be sweet to have a friend to tell things to at night, <line> <line>without the terrible sex price to pay. <line> <line>this is a childish idea, i know. <line> <line>my education, i have to admit, has been gappy. <line> <line>the basic rules of male-female relations <line> <line>were imparted atmospherically in our family, <line> <line>no direct speech allowed. <line> <line>i remember one sunday i was sitting in the backseat of the car. <line> <line>father in front. <line> <line>we were waiting in the driveway for mother, <line> <line>who came around the corner of the house <line> <line>and got into the passenger side of the car <line> <line>dressed in a yellow chanel suit and black high heels. <line> <line>father glanced sideways at her. <line> <line>showing a good bit of leg today mother, he said <line> <line>in a voice which i (age eleven) thought odd. <line> <line>i stared at the back of her head waiting for what she would say. <line> <line>her answer would clear this up. <line> <line>but she just laughed a strange laugh with ropes all over it. <line> <line>later that summer i put this laugh together with another laugh <line> <line>i overheard as i was going upstairs. <line> <line>she was talking on the telephone in the kitchen. <line> <line>well a woman would be just as happy with a kiss on the cheek <line> <line>most of the time but you know men, <line> <line>she was saying. laugh. <line> <line>not ropes, thorns. <line> <line>i have arrived at the middle of the moor <line> <line>where the ground goes down into a low swampy place. <line> <line>the swamp water is frozen solid. <line> <line>bits of gold weed <line> <line>have etched themselves <line> <line>on the underside of the ice like messages. <line> <line> i’ll come when thou art saddest, <line> <line> laid alone in the darkened room; <line> <line> when the mad day’s mirth has vanished, <line> <line> and the smile of joy is banished, <line> <line> i’ll come when the heart’s real feeling <line> <line> has entire, unbiased sway, <line> <line> and my influence o’er thee stealing <line> <line> grief deepening, joy congealing, <line> <line> shall bear thy soul away. <line> <line> listen! ’tis just the hour, <line> <line> the awful time for thee: <line> <line> dost thou not feel upon thy soul <line> <line> a flood of strange sensations roll, <line> <line> forerunners of a sterner power, <line> <line> heralds of me? <line> <line>very hard to read, the messages that pass <line> <line>between thou and emily. <line> <line>in this poem she reverses their roles, <line> <line>speaking not as the victim but to the victim. <line> <line>it is chilling to watch thou move upon thou, <line> <line>who lies alone in the dark waiting to be mastered. <line> <line>it is a shock to realize that this low, slow collusion <line> <line>of master and victim within one voice <line> <line>is a rationale <line> <line>for the most awful loneliness of the poet’s hour. <line> <line>she has reversed the roles of thou and thou <line> <line>not as a display of power <line> <line>but to force out of herself some pity <line> <line>for this soul trapped in glass, <line> <line>which is her true creation. <line> <line>those nights lying alone <line> <line>are not discontinuous with this cold hectic dawn. <line> <line>it is who i am. <line> <line>is it a vocation of anger? <line> <line>why construe silence <line> <line>as the real presence? <line> <line>why stoop to kiss this doorstep? <line> <line>why be unstrung and pounded flat and pine away <line> <line>imagining someone vast to whom i may vent the swell of my soul? <line> <line>emily was fond of psalm 130. <line> <line>“my soul waiteth on thou more than they that watch for the morning, <line> <line>i say more than they that watch for the morning.” <line> <line>i like to believe that for her the act of watching provided a shelter, <line> <line>that her collusion with thou gave ease to anger and desire: <line> <line>”in thou they are quenched as a fire of thorns,“ says the psalmist. <line> <line>but for myself i do not believe this, i am not quenched— <line> <line>with thou or without thou i find no shelter. <line> <line>i am my own nude. <line> <line>and nudes have a difficult sexual destiny. <line> <line>i have watched this destiny disclose itself <line> <line>in its jerky passage from girl to woman to who i am now, <line> <line>from love to anger to this cold marrow, <line> <line>from fire to shelter to fire. <line> <line>what is the opposite of believing in thou— <line> <line>merely not believing in thou? no. that is too simple. <line> <line>that is to prepare a misunderstanding. <line> <line>i want to speak more clearly. <line> <line>perhaps the nudes are the best way. <line> <line>nude #5. deck of cards. <line> <line>each card is made of flesh. <line> <line>the living cards are days of a woman’s life. <line> <line>i see a great silver needle go flashing right through the deck once from end to <line> <line> end. <line> <line>nude #6 i cannot remember. <line> <line>nude #7. white room whose walls, <line> <line>having neither planes nor curves nor angles, <line> <line>are composed of a continuous satiny white membrane <line> <line>like the flesh of some interior organ of the moon. <line> <line>it is a living surface, almost wet. <line> <line>lucency breathes in and out. <line> <line>rainbows shudder across it. <line> <line>and around the walls of the room a voice goes whispering,be very careful. be very careful. <line> <line>nude #8. black disc on which the fires of all the winds <line> <line>are attached in a row. <line> <line>a woman stands on the disc <line> <line>amid the winds whose long yellow silk flames <line> <line>flow and vibrate up through her. <line> <line>nude #9. transparent loam. <line> <line>under the loam a woman has dug a long deep trench. <line> <line>into the trench she is placing small white forms, i don’t know what they are. <line> <line>nude #10. green thorn of the world poking up <line> <line>alive through the heart of a woman <line> <line>who lies on her back on the ground. <line> <line>the thorn is exploding <line> <line>its green blood above her in the air.everything it is it has, the voice says. <line> <line>nude #11. ledge in outer space. <line> <line>space is bluish black and glossy as solid water <line> <line>and moving very fast in all directions, <line> <line>shrieking past the woman who stands pinned <line> <line>to nothing by its pressure. <line> <line>she peers and glances for some way to go, trying to lift her hand but cannot. <line> <line>nude #12. old pole in the wind. <line> <line>cold currents are streaming over it <line> <line>and pulling out <line> <line>into ragged long horizontal black lines <line> <line>some shreds of ribbon <line> <line>attached to the pole. <line> <line>i cannot see how they are attached— <line> <line>notches? staples? nails? all of a sudden the wind changes <line> <line>and all the black shreds rise straight up in the air <line> <line>and tie themselves into knots, <line> <line>then untie and float down. <line> <line>the wind is gone. <line> <line>it waits. <line> <line>by this time, midway through winter, <line> <line>i had become entirely fascinated with my spiritual melodrama. <line> <line>then it stopped. <line> <line>days passed, months passed and i saw nothing. <line> <line>i continued to peer and glance, sitting on the rug in front of my sofa <line> <line>in the curtainless morning <line> <line>with my nerves open to the air like something skinned. <line> <line>i saw nothing. <line> <line>outside the window spring storms came and went. <line> <line>april snow folded its huge white paws over doors and porches. <line> <line>i watched a chunk of it lean over the roof and break off <line> <line>and fall and i thought, <line> <line>how slow! as it glided soundlessly past, <line> <line>but still—nothing. no nudes. <line> <line>no thou. <line> <line>a great icicle formed on the railing of my balcony <line> <line>so i drew up close to the window and tried peering through the icicle, <line> <line>hoping to trick myself into some interior vision, <line> <line>but all i saw <line> <line>was the man and woman in the room across the street <line> <line>making their bed and laughing. <line> <line>i stopped watching. <line> <line>i forgot about nudes. <line> <line>i lived my life, <line> <line>which felt like a switched-off tv. <line> <line>something had gone through me and out and i could not own it. <line> <line>“no need now to tremble for the hard frost and the keen wind. <line> <line>emily does not feel them,” <line> <line>wrote charlotte the day after burying her sister. <line> <line>emily had shaken free. <line> <line>a soul can do that. <line> <line>whether it goes to join thou and sit on the porch for all eternity <line> <line>enjoying jokes and kisses and beautiful cold spring evenings, <line> <line>you and i will never know. but i can tell you what i saw. <line> <line>nude #13 arrived when i was not watching for it. <line> <line>it came at night. <line> <line>very much like nude #1. <line> <line>and yet utterly different. <line> <line>i saw a high hill and on it a form shaped against hard air. <line> <line>it could have been just a pole with some old cloth attached, <line> <line>but as i came closer <line> <line>i saw it was a human body <line>

will he now retire after appearance, and again prolong our expectation? god of israel, send thy messiah forth, the time is come; behold the kings of the earth how they oppress thy chosen, to what highth thir pow'r unjust they have exalted, and behind them cast all fear of thee, arise and vindicate thy glory, free thy people from thir yoke, but let us wait; thus far he hath perform'd, sent his anointed, and to us reveal'd him, by his great prophet, pointed at and shown, in publick, and with him we have convers'd; let us be glad of this, and all our fears lay on his providence; he will not fail nor will withdraw him now, nor will recall, mock us with his blest sight, then snatch him hence, soon we shall see our hope, our joy return. thus they out of their plaints new hope resume to find whom at the first they found unsought: but to his mother mary, when she saw others return'd from baptism, not her son, nor left at jordan, tydings of him none; within her brest, though calm; her brest though pure, motherly cares and fears got head, and rais'd some troubl'd thoughts, which she in sighs thus clad. o what avails me now that honour high to have conceiv'd of god, or that salute hale highly favour'd, among women blest; while i to sorrows am no less advanc't, and fears as eminent, above the lot of other women, by the birth i bore, in such a season born when scarce a shed could be obtain'd to shelter him or me from the bleak air; a stable was our warmth, a manger his, yet soon enforc't to flye thence into egypt, till the murd'rous king were dead, who sought his life, and missing fill'd with infant blood the streets of bethlehem; from egypt home return'd, in nazareth hath been our dwelling many years, his life private, unactive, calm, contemplative, little suspicious to any king; but now full grown to man, acknowledg'd, as i hear, by john the baptist, and in publick shown, son own'd from heaven by his father's voice; i look't for some great change; to honour? no, but trouble, as old simeon plain fore-told, that to the fall and rising he should be of many in israel, and to a sign spoken against, that through my very soul a sword shall pierce, this is my favour'd lot, my exaltation to afflictions high; afflicted i may be, it seems, and blest; i will not argue that, nor will repine. but where delays he now? some great intent conceals him: when twelve years he scarce had seen, i lost him, but so found, as well i saw he could not lose himself; but went about his father's business; what he meant i mus'd, since understand; much more his absence now thus long to some great purpose he obscures. but i to wait with patience am inur'd; my heart hath been a store-house long of things and sayings laid up, portending strange events. thus mary pondering oft, and oft to mind recalling what remarkably had pass'd since first her salutation heard, with thoughts meekly compos'd awaited the fulfilling: the while her son tracing the desert wild, sole but with holiest meditations fed, into himself descended, and at once all his great work to come before him set; how to begin, how to accomplish best his end of being on earth, and mission high: for satan with slye preface to return had left him vacant, and with speed was gon up to the middle region of thick air, where all his potentates in council sate; there without sign of boast, or sign of joy, sollicitous and blank he thus began. princes, heavens antient sons, æthereal thrones, demonian spirits now, from the element each of his reign allotted, rightlier call'd, powers of fire, air, water, and earth beneath, so may we hold our place and these mild seats without new trouble; such an enemy is ris'n to invade us, who no less threat'ns then our expulsion down to hell; i, as i undertook, and with the vote consenting in full frequence was impowr'd, have found him, view'd him, tasted him, but find far other labour to be undergon then when i dealt with adam first of men, though adam by his wives allurement fell, however to this man inferior far, if he be man by mothers side at least, with more then humane gifts from heaven adorn'd, perfections absolute, graces divine, and amplitude of mind to greatest deeds. therefore i am return'd, lest confidence of my success with eve in paradise deceive ye to perswasion over-sure of like succeeding here; i summon all rather to be in readiness, with hand or counsel to assist; lest i who erst thought none my equal, now be over-match'd. so spake the old serpent doubting, and from all with clamour was assur'd thir utmost aid at his command; when from amidst them rose belial the dissolutest spirit that fell, the sensuallest, and after asmodai the fleshliest incubus, and thus advis'd. set women in his eye and in his walk, among daughters of men the fairest found; many are in each region passing fair as the noon skie; more like to goddesses then mortal creatures, graceful and discreet, expert in amorous arts, enchanting tongues perswasive, virgin majesty with mild and sweet allay'd, yet terrible to approach, skill'd to retire, and in retiring draw hearts after them tangl'd in amorous nets. such object hath the power to soft'n and tame severest temper, smooth the rugged'st brow, enerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve, draw out with credulous desire, and lead at will the manliest, resolutest brest, as the magnetic hardest iron draws. women, when nothing else, beguil'd the heart of wisest solomon, and made him build, and made him bow to the gods of his wives. to whom quick answer satan thus return'd. belial, in much uneven scale thou weigh'st all others by thy self; because of old thou thy self doat'st on womankind, admiring thir shape, thir colour, and attractive grace, none are, thou think'st, but taken with such toys. before the flood thou with thy lusty crew, false titl'd sons of god, roaming the earth cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men, and coupl'd with them, and begot a race. have we not seen, or by relation heard, in courts and regal chambers how thou lurk'st, in wood or grove by mossie fountain side, in valley or green meadow to way-lay some beauty rare, calisto, clymene, daphne, or semele, antiopa, or amymone, syrinx, many more too long, then lay'st thy scapes on names ador'd, apollo, neptune, jupiter, or pan, satyr, or fawn, or silvan? but these haunts delight not all; among the sons of men, how many have with a smile made small account of beauty and her lures, easily scorn'd all her assaults, on worthier things intent? remember that pellean conquerour, a youth, how all the beauties of the east he slightly view'd, and slightly over-pass'd; how hee sirnam'd of africa dismiss'd in his prime youth the fair iberian maid. for solomon he liv'd at ease, and full of honour, wealth, high fare, aim'd not beyond higher design then to enjoy his state; thence to the bait of women lay expos'd; but he whom we attempt is wiser far then solomon, of more exalted mind, made and set wholly on the accomplishment of greatest things; what woman will you find, though of this age the wonder and the fame, on whom his leisure will vouchsafe an eye of fond desire? or should she confident, as sitting queen ador'd on beauties throne, descend with all her winning charms begirt to enamour, as the zone of venus once wrought that effect on jove, so fables tell; how would one look from his majestick brow seated as on the top of vertues hill, discount'nance her despis'd, and put to rout all her array; her female pride deject, or turn to reverent awe? for beauty stands in the admiration only of weak minds led captive; cease to admire, and all her plumes fall flat and shrink into a trivial toy, at every sudden slighting quite abasht: therefore with manlier objects we must try his constancy, with such as have more shew of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise; rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wreck'd; or that which only seems to satisfie lawful desires of nature, not beyond; and now i know he hungers where no food is to be found, in the wide wilderness; the rest commit to me, i shall let pass no advantage, and his strength as oft assay. he ceas'd, and heard thir grant in loud acclaim; then forthwith to him takes a chosen band of spirits likest to himself in guile to be at hand, and at his beck appear, if cause were to unfold some active scene of various persons each to know his part; then to the desert takes with these his flight; where still from shade to shade the son of god after forty days fasting had remain'd, now hungring first, and to himself thus said. where will this end? four times ten days i have pass'd wandring this woody maze, and humane food nor tasted, nor had appetite; that fast to vertue i impute not, or count part of what i suffer here; if nature need not, or god support nature without repast though needing, what praise is it to endure? but now i feel i hunger, which declares, nature hath need of what she asks; yet god can satisfie that need some other way, though hunger still remain: so it remain without this bodies wasting, i content me, and from the sting of famine fear no harm, nor mind it, fed with better thoughts that feed mee hungring more to do my fathers will. it was the hour of night, when thus the son commun'd in silent walk, then laid him down under the hospitable covert nigh of trees thick interwoven; there he slept, and dream'd, as appetite is wont to dream, of meats and drinks, natures refreshment sweet; him thought, he by the brook of cherith stood and saw the ravens with their horny beaks food to elijah bringing even and morn, though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought: he saw the prophet also how he fled into the desert, and how there he slept under a juniper; then how awakt, he found his supper on the coals prepar'd, and by the angel was bid rise and eat, and eat the second time after repose, the strength whereof suffic'd him forty days; sometimes that with elijah he partook, or as a guest with daniel at his pulse. thus wore out night, and now the herald lark left his ground-nest, high towring to descry the morns approach, and greet her with his song: as lightly from his grassy couch up rose our saviour, and found all was but a dream, fasting he went to sleep, and fasting wak'd. up to a hill anon his steps he rear'd, from whose high top to ken the prospect round, if cottage were in view, sheep-cote or herd; but cottage, herd or sheep-cote none he saw, only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove, with chaunt of tuneful birds resounding loud; thither he bent his way, determin'd there to rest at noon, and entr'd soon the shade high rooft and walks beneath, and alleys brown that open'd in the midst a woody scene, natures own work it seem'd (nature taught art) and to a superstitious eye the haunt of wood-gods and wood-nymphs; he view'd it round, when suddenly a man before him stood, not rustic as before, but seemlier clad, as one in city, or court, or palace bred, and with fair speech these words to him address'd. with granted leave officious i return, but much more wonder that the son of god in this wild solitude so long should bide of all things destitute, and well i know, not without hunger. others of some note, as story tells, have trod this wilderness; the fugitive bond-woman with her son out cast nebaioth, yet found he relief by a providing angel; all the race of israel here had famish'd, had not god rain'd from heaven manna, and that prophet bold native of thebes wandring here was fed twice by a voice inviting him to eat. of thee these forty days none hath regard, forty and more deserted here indeed. to whom thus jesus; what conclud'st thou hence? they all had need, i as thou seest have none. how hast thou hunger then? satan reply'd, tell me if food were now before thee set, would'st thou not eat? thereafter as i like the giver, answer'd jesus. why should that cause thy refusal, said the subtle fiend, hast thou not right to all created things, owe not all creatures by just right to thee duty and service, nor to stay till bid, but tender all their power? nor mention i meats by the law unclean, or offer'd first to idols, those young daniel could refuse; nor proffer'd by an enemy, though who would scruple that, with want opprest? behold nature asham'd, or better to express, troubl'd that thou shouldst hunger, hath purvey'd from all the elements her choicest store to treat thee as beseems, and as her lord with honour, only deign to sit and eat. he spake no dream, for as his words had end, our saviour lifting up his eyes beheld in ample space under the broadest shade a table richly spred, in regal mode, with dishes pill'd, and meats of noblest sort and savour, beasts of chase, or fowl of game, in pastry built, or from the spit, or boyl'd, gris-amber-steam'd; all fish from sea or shore, freshet, or purling brook, of shell or fin, and exquisitest name, for which was drain'd pontus and lucrine bay, and afric coast. alas how simple, to these cates compar'd, was that crude apple that diverted eve! and at a stately side-board by the wine that fragrant smell diffus'd, in order stood tall stripling youths rich clad, of fairer hew then ganymed or hylas, distant more under the trees now trip'd, now solemn stood nymphs of diana's train, and naiades with fruits and flowers from amalthea's horn, and ladies of th' hesperides, that seem'd fairer then feign'd of old, or fabl'd since of fairy damsels met in forest wide by knights of logres, or of lyones, lancelot or pelleas, or pellenore, and all the while harmonious airs were heard of chiming strings, or charming pipes and winds of gentlest gale arabian odors fann'd from their soft wings, and flora's earliest smells. such was the splendour, and the tempter now his invitation earnestly renew'd. what doubts the son of god to sit and eat? these are not fruits forbidden, no interdict defends the touching of these viands pure, thir taste no knowledge works, at least of evil, but life preserves, destroys life's enemy, hunger, with sweet restorative delight. all these are spirits of air, and woods, and springs, thy gentle ministers, who come to pay thee homage, and acknowledge thee thir lord: what doubt'st thou son of god? sit down and eat. to whom thus jesus temperately reply'd: said'st thou not that to all things i had right? and who withholds my pow'r that right to use? shall i receive by gift what of my own, when and where likes me best, i can command? i can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou, command a table in this wilderness, and call swift flights of angels ministrant array'd in glory on my cup to attend: why shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence, in vain, where no acceptance it can find, and with my hunger what has thou to do? thy pompous delicacies i contemn, and count thy specious gifts no gifts but guiles. to whom thus answer'd satan malecontent: that i have also power to give thou seest, if of that pow'r i bring thee voluntary what i might have bestow'd on whom i pleas'd, and rather opportunely in this place chose to impart to thy apparent need, why shouldst thou not accept it? but i see what i can do or offer is suspect; of these things others quickly will dispose whose pains have earn'd the far fet spoil. with that both table and provision vanish'd quite with sound of harpies wings, and talons heard; only the importune tempter still remain'd, and with these words his temptation pursu'd. by hunger, that each other creature tames, thou art not to be harm'd, therefore not mov'd; thy temperance invincible besides, for no allurement yields to appetite, and all thy heart is set on high designs, high actions; but wherewith to be atchiev'd? great acts require great means of enterprise, thou art unknown, unfriended, low of birth, a carpenter thy father known, thy self bred up in poverty and streights at home; lost in a desert here and hunger-bit: which way or from what hope dost thou aspire to greatness? whence authority deriv'st, what followers, what retinue canst thou gain, or at thy heels the dizzy multitude, longer then thou canst feed them on thy cost? money brings honour, friends, conquest, and realms; what rais'd antipater the edomite, and his son herod plac'd on juda's throne; (thy throne) but gold that got him puissant friends? therefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive, get riches first, get wealth, and treasure heap, not difficult, if thou hearken to me, riches are mine, fortune is in my hand; they whom i favour thrive in wealth amain, while virtue, valour, wisdom sit in want. to whom thus jesus patiently reply'd; yet wealth without these three is impotent, to gain dominion or to keep it gain'd. witness those antient empires of the earth, in highth of all thir flowing wealth dissolv'd: but men endu'd with these have oft attain'd in lowest poverty to highest deeds; gideon and jephtha, and the shepherd lad, whose off-spring on the throne of juda sat so many ages, and shall yet regain that seat, and reign in israel without end. among the heathen, (for throughout the world to me is not unknown what hath been done worthy of memorial) canst thou not remember quintius, fabricius, curius, regulus? for i esteem those names of men so poor who could do mighty things, and could contemn riches though offer'd from the hand of kings. and what in me seems wanting, but that i may also in this poverty as soon accomplish what they did, perhaps and more? extol not riches then, the toyl of fools, the wise mans cumbrance if not snare, more apt to slacken virtue, and abate her edge, then prompt her to do aught may merit praise. what if with like aversion i reject riches and realms; yet not for that a crown, golden in shew, is but a wreath of thorns, brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights to him who wears the regal diadem, when on his shoulders each mans burden lies; for therein stands the office of a king, his honour, vertue, merit and chief praise, that for the publick all this weight he bears. yet he who reigns within himself, and rules passions, desires, and fears, is more a king; which every wise and vertuous man attains: and who attains not, ill aspires to rule cities of men or head-strong multitudes, subject himself to anarchy within, or lawless passions in him which he serves. but to guide nations in the way of truth by saving doctrine, and from errour lead to know, and knowing worship god aright, is yet more kingly, this attracts the soul, governs the inner man, the nobler part, that other o're the body only reigns, and oft by force, which to a generous mind so reigning can be no sincere delight. besides to give a kingdom hath been thought greater and nobler done, and to lay down far more magnanimous, then to assume. riches are needless then, both for themselves, and for thy reason why they should be sought, to gain a scepter, oftest better miss't. <line>","religion,christianity,god & the divine"

what were you thinking?” <line> <line> <line>i said, “i thought what i had covered was the world.”the unsayable: one of the traditional paradoxes of the dead is how they do not emit information. because the dead do not emit light, which cannot escape the event horizon of the deceased, they can only be detected by the symptoms they leave on the surrounding matter, the haloed matter burning at their corona, the white marks scarring the x-rays. a person can survive within the dead once it has gravitationally collapsed. this happens for only a second from the observer’s eye, but, because of gravitational time dilation, grief occurs a nearly infinitely long time for the person who chooses to live inside the dead.tlacuilo, graphic novelist at the world’s end: in those california days after my dad died, i felt the life began to seep out of me into the ground and so i brought my sneakers to the cobbler for resoling, which strangely enough did not mitigate my newfound grief. sometimes i would find myself gazing out the window at the garden my mom cultivated behind her house, often while performing an edwardian pose of wan melancholy, and as i approached, the glass would immediately darken as though saturated with an egglike blue shadow. (i later realized this shadow was caused by my head blocking the lamplight and decided to simply lean back.) i found myself stricken with headaches for some reason when i neglected to eat for days. i began laying my head on the carpet as though listening for footsteps, which i did often in those days, perhaps i believed the sun would itself walk inside and incite me, when i saw a woman in my mother’s backyard. i did not recognize her. <line> <line> <line>she crouched on the ground holding what i thought was a knife. i thought i saw her carving the earth into sections. as i came closer, i saw that what she grasped in her hand was a quill, though she held it with such authority that she looked as though she held the earth by its handle. all the cracks that scrawled between the grass—i saw that these were not cracks. they were sketches. and what a strange thing, looking back on it, how i never wondered what this woman was doing in my mother’s backyard. she glanced up at me as i approached and said, “everyone i know is dead. i am also dead, but someone must stay behind and document my death. i am the only archivist, so i remain suspended between death and history.” <line> <line> <line>i realized what was occurring and asked, selfishly, “so it’s possible to talk to someone who is dead?” <line> <line> <line>“you do it all the time. it’s like what youmna told you to write into your eulogy.” <line> <line> <line>“yeah, okay.” i paused. “but he never remembers to talk back to me.” <line> <line> <line>she took out two cubes, possibly carved from bone, and threw them at my feet. “what’s that for?” i kneeled closer to her. “is this fortune telling?” <line> <line> <line>“it’s your stats and hit points.” <line> <line> <line>i laughed. “you’re sending me into a dungeon?” <line> <line> <line>“no,” she said. “you are going on a pilgrimage. a pilgrimage to hell.”initiation: to prepare for your descent (for there was no question of which direction you would eventually end up), you began your initiation into three domains of sorcery: the silent vows of grief; the generative magics obtained through meditation upon the colonial archive; and apprenticeship into all manner of low-level magics, including wonder-making, liberating demons, clairvoyance of the past, fierce activities, special jumping abilities, control over the three worlds, abridgment of one’s own lifespan through nicotine inhalation, research methods, the augmentation of merit and pleasure by generating poetry using your body, red optic blasts, melancholy of the spleen, a frequent customer stamp card for woorijip korean deli. your first prophesied guru was the tlacuilo, the woman historian who had ventured to the underworld by standing witness at the end of the mexica and the cosmogony of the new world. she had painted omens of the future that now served you as diagrams of the past: the two-headed man who presented his body to moctezuma, the comet whose banner waved across the sky and heralded the origin of the next kingdom, and the pale ghosts in steel skins who came as gods and guests, the ghosts who at the festival of toxcatl came to kill us. one of them sawed off a man’s head, another speared the eye of a warrior who was betrothed to your sister. the tlacuilo led you to the black lake that mexico city had become. you did not know if you were in a fantasy or the past. you were in a fantasy and the past. small skiffs wobbled by, as did wounded bodies that dyed the waters red. surrounded by corpses levitating upon the waters, she taught you the first sorcery, that of death’s erasure. she cut off the hole of your mouth so you could say nothing, nothing commensurate with death, nothing can be commensurate to that dark infinity, and so you lost no breaths and so you followed her from the shores (sores) and the waterline slowly became the horizon line of the sky and you could breathe. white fish flew by, gliding without effort. you looked one in the eye and it sucked its cow lips silently at you. she said that this was atlantis or one of many atlantises and you saw yourself walking beside her on a road towards an underwater city that you could see only as a speck in the far distance. you tripped on the body of a dead man, seemingly chinese, his body weighed down with rock-filled bags. the tlacuilo, who by this time walked far in front of you, came back and told you this man’s name but asked you to stay silent. she led you about a mile further down the road towards the first station set aside for pilgrims such as yourself. here she transmitted another teaching. there will also be other ages after this one, she said. other suns will rise and fall. i will instruct you towards the attainment of a new title: the cowerer from the sun. she taught you how to crawl on the seabed, a weeping hog crawling on hands and knees. my final teaching is this: go in fear of the sun. having said this, she set her own body down in a fetal position and waited for the

gold! the opera house is a treasure-box of gold. gold in a broad smear across the orchestra pit: gold of horns, trumpets, tubas; gold—spun-gold, twittering-gold, snapping-gold of harps. the conductor raises his baton, the brass blares out crass, crude, parvenu, fat, powerful, golden. rich as the fat, clapping hands in the boxes. cymbals, gigantic, coin-shaped, crash. the orange curtain parts and the prima-donna steps forward. one note, a drop: transparent, iridescent, a gold bubble, it floats . . . floats . . . and bursts against the lips of a bank president in the grand tier. iv afternoon rain in state street cross-hatchings of rain against grey walls, slant lines of black rain in front of the up and down, wet stone sides of buildings. below, greasy, shiny, black, horizontal, the street. and over it, umbrellas, black polished dots struck to white an instant, stream in two flat lines slipping past each other with the smoothness of oil. like a four-sided wedge the custom house tower pokes at the low, flat sky, pushing it farther and farther up, lifting it away from the house-tops, lifting it in one piece as though it were a sheet of tin, with the lever of its apex. the cross-hatchings of rain cut the tower obliquely, scratching lines of black wire across it, mutilating its perpendicular grey surface with the sharp precision of tools. the city is rigid with straight lines and angles, a chequered table of blacks and greys. oblong blocks of flatness crawl by with low-geared engines, and pass to short upright squares shrinking with distance. a steamer in the basin blows its whistle, and the sound shoots across the rain hatchings, a narrow, level bar of steel. hard cubes of lemon superimpose themselves upon the fronts of buildings as the windows light up. but the lemon cubes are edged with angles upon which they cannot impinge. up, straight, down, straight—square. crumpled grey-white papers blow along the side-walks, contorted, horrible, without curves. a horse steps in a puddle, a white, glaring water spurts up in stiff, outflaring lines, like the rattling stems of reeds. the city is heraldic with angles, a sombre escutcheon of argent and sable and countercoloured bends of rain hung over a four-square civilization. when a street lamp comes out, i gaze at it for full thirty seconds to rest my brain with the suffusing, round brilliance of its globe. v an aquarium streaks of green and yellow iridescence, silver shiftings, rings veering out of rings, silver—gold— grey-green opaqueness sliding down, with sharp white bubbles shooting and dancing, flinging quickly outward. nosing the bubbles, swallowing them, fish. blue shadows against silver-saffron water, the light rippling over them in steel-bright tremors. outspread translucent fins flute, fold, and relapse; the threaded light prints through them on the pebbles in scarcely tarnished twinklings. curving of spotted spines, slow up-shifts, lazy convolutions: then a sudden swift straightening and darting below: oblique grey shadows athwart a pale casement. roped and curled, green man-eating eels slumber in undulate rhythms, with crests laid horizontal on their backs. barred fish, striped fish, uneven disks of fish, slip, slide, whirl, turn, and never touch. metallic blue fish, with fins wide and yellow and swaying like oriental fans, hold the sun in their bellies and glow with light: blue brilliance cut by black bars. an oblong pane of straw-coloured shimmer, across it, in a tangent, a smear of rose, black, silver. short twists and upstartings, rose-black, in a setting of bubbles: sunshine playing between red and black flowers on a blue and gold lawn. shadows and polished surfaces, facets of mauve and purple, a constant modulation of values. shaft-shaped, with green bead eyes; thick-nosed, heliotrope-coloured; swift spots of chrysolite and coral; in the midst of green, pearl, amethyst irradiations. outside, a willow-tree flickers with little white jerks, and long blue waves rise steadily beyond the outer islands. <line>","nature,weather,social commentaries,cities & urban life"

what better teach a foreigner the tongue? what's long or short, each accent where to place, and speak in public with some sort of grace. i scarce can think him such a worthless thing, unless he praise some monster of a king; or virtue or religion turn to sport, to please a lewd, or unbelieving court. unhappy dryden!—in all charles's days, roscommon only boasts unspotted bays; and in our own (excuse some courtly stains) no whiter page than addison remains. he, from the taste obscene reclaims our youth, and sets the passions on the side of truth, forms the soft bosom with the gentlest art, and pours each human virtue in the heart. let ireland tell, how wit upheld her cause, her trade supported, and supplied her laws; and leave on swift this grateful verse engrav'd, ""the rights a court attack'd, a poet sav'd."" behold the hand that wrought a nation's cure, stretch'd to relieve the idiot and the poor, proud vice to brand, or injur'd worth adorn, and stretch the ray to ages yet unborn. not but there are, who merit other palms; hopkins and sternhold glad the heart with psalms: the boys and girls whom charity maintains, implore your help in these pathetic strains: how could devotion touch the country pews, unless the gods bestow'd a proper muse? verse cheers their leisure, verse assists their work, verse prays for peace, or sings down pope and turk. the silenc'd preacher yields to potent strain, and feels that grace his pray'r besought in vain; the blessing thrills through all the lab'ring throng, and heav'n is won by violence of song. our rural ancestors, with little blest, patient of labour when the end was rest, indulg'd the day that hous'd their annual grain, with feasts, and off'rings, and a thankful strain: the joy their wives, their sons, and servants share, ease of their toil, and part'ners of their care: the laugh, the jest, attendants on the bowl, smooth'd ev'ry brow, and open'd ev'ry soul: with growing years the pleasing licence grew, and taunts alternate innocently flew. but times corrupt, and nature, ill-inclin'd, produc'd the point that left a sting behind; till friend with friend, and families at strife, triumphant malice rag'd through private life. who felt the wrong, or fear'd it, took th' alarm, appeal'd to law, and justice lent her arm. at length, by wholesome dread of statutes bound, the poets learn'd to please, and not to wound: most warp'd to flatt'ry's side; but some, more nice, preserv'd the freedom, and forbore the vice. hence satire rose, that just the medium hit, and heals with morals what it hurts with wit. we conquer'd france, but felt our captive's charms; her arts victorious triumph'd o'er our arms; britain to soft refinements less a foe, wit grew polite, and numbers learn'd to flow. waller was smooth; but dryden taught to join the varying verse, the full-resounding line, the long majestic march, and energy divine. though still some traces of our rustic vein and splayfoot verse remain'd, and will remain. late, very late, correctness grew our care, when the tir'd nation breath'd from civil war. exact racine, and corneille's noble fire show'd us that france had something to admire. not but the tragic spirit was our own, and full in shakespeare, fair in otway shone: but otway fail'd to polish or refine, and fluent shakespeare scarce effac'd a line. ev'n copious dryden wanted, or forgot, the last and greatest art, the art to blot. some doubt, if equal pains, or equal fire the humbler muse of comedy require. but in known images of life, i guess the labour greater, as th' indulgence less. observe how seldom ev'n the best succeed: tell me if congreve's fools are fools indeed? what pert, low dialogue has farqu'ar writ! how van wants grace, who never wanted wit! the stage how loosely does astr{ae}ea tread, who fairly puts all characters to bed! and idle cibber, how he breaks the laws, to make poor pinky eat with vast applause! but fill their purse, our poet's work is done, alike to them, by pathos or by pun. o you! whom vanity's light bark conveys on fame's mad voyage by the wind of praise, with what a shifting gale your course you ply, for ever sunk too low, or borne too high! who pants for glory finds but short repose, a breath revives him, or a breath o'erthrows. farewell the stage! if just as thrives the play, the silly bard grows fat, or falls away. there still remains, to mortify a wit, the many-headed monster of the pit: a senseless, worthless, and unhonour'd crowd; who, to disturb their betters mighty proud, clatt'ring their sticks before ten lines are spoke, call for the farce, the bear, or the black-joke. what dear delight to britons farce affords! farce once the taste of mobs, but now of lords; (for taste, eternal wanderer, now flies from heads to ears, and now from ears to eyes.) the play stands still; damn action and discourse, back fly the scenes, and enter foot and horse; pageants on pageants, in long order drawn, peers, heralds, bishops, ermine, gold, and lawn; the champion too! and, to complete the jest, old edward's armour beams on cibber's breast. with laughter sure democritus had died, had he beheld an audience gape so wide. let bear or elephant be e'er so white, the people, sure, the people are the sight! ah luckless poet! stretch thy lungs and roar, that bear or elephant shall heed thee more; while all its throats the gallery extends, and all the thunder of the pit ascends! loud as the wolves on orcas' stormy steep, howl to the roarings of the northern deep. such is the shout, the long-applauding note, at quin's high plume, or oldfield's petticoat, or when from court a birthday suit bestow'd sinks the lost actor in the tawdry load. booth enters—hark! the universal peal! ""but has he spoken?"" not a syllable. ""what shook the stage, and made the people stare?"" cato's long wig, flow'r'd gown, and lacquer'd chair. yet lest you think i rally more than teach, or praise malignly arts i cannot reach, let me for once presume t'instruct the times, to know the poet from the man of rhymes: 'tis he, who gives my breast a thousand pains, can make me feel each passion that he feigns; enrage, compose, with more than magic art, with pity and with terror tear my heart; and snatch me o'er the earth or thro' the air, to thebes, to athens, when he will, and where. but not this part of the poetic state alone, deserves the favour of the great: think of those authors, sir, who would rely more on a reader's sense, than gazer's eye. or who shall wander where the muses sing? who climb their mountain, or who taste their spring? how shall we fill a library with wit, when merlin's cave is half unfurnish'd yet? my liege! why writers little claim your thought, i guess: and, with their leave, will tell the fault: we poets are (upon a poet's word) of all mankind, the creatures most absurd: the season, when to come, and when to go, to sing, or cease to sing, we never know; and if we will recite nine hours in ten, you lose your patience, just like other men. then too we hurt ourselves, when to defend a single verse, we quarrel with a friend; repeat unask'd; lament, the wit's too fine for vulgar eyes, and point out ev'ry line. but most, when straining with too weak a wing, we needs will write epistles to the king; and from the moment we oblige the town, expect a place, or pension from the crown; or dubb'd historians by express command, t'enroll your triumphs o'er the seas and land, be call'd to court to plan some work divine, as once for louis, boileau and racine. yet think, great sir! (so many virtues shown) ah think, what poet best may make them known? or choose at least some minister of grace, fit to bestow the laureate's weighty place. charles, to late times to be transmitted fair, assign'd his figure to bernini's care; and great nassau to kneller's hand decreed to fix him graceful on the bounding steed; so well in paint and stone they judg'd of merit: but kings in wit may want discerning spirit. the hero william, and the martyr charles, one knighted blackmore, and one pension'd quarles; which made old ben, and surly dennis swear, ""no lord's anointed, but a russian bear."" not with such majesty, such bold relief, the forms august, of king, or conqu'ring chief, e'er swell'd on marble; as in verse have shin'd (in polish'd verse) the manners and the mind. oh! could i mount on the m{ae}onian wing, your arms, your actions, your repose to sing! what seas you travers'd! and what fields you fought! your country's peace, how oft, how dearly bought! how barb'rous rage subsided at your word, and nations wonder'd while they dropp'd the sword! how, when you nodded, o'er the land and deep, peace stole her wing, and wrapp'd the world in sleep; till earth's extremes your mediation own, and asia's tyrants tremble at your throne— but verse, alas! your majesty disdains; and i'm not us'd to panegyric strains: the zeal of fools offends at any time, but most of all, the zeal of fools in rhyme, besides, a fate attends on all i write, that when i aim at praise, they say i bite. a vile encomium doubly ridicules: there's nothing blackens like the ink of fools; if true, a woeful likeness; and if lies, ""praise undeserv'd is scandal in disguise."" well may he blush, who gives it, or receives; and when i flatter, let my dirty leaves (like journals, odes, and such forgotten things as eusden, philips, settle, writ of kings) clothe spice, line trunks, or flutt'ring in a row, befringe the rails of bedlam and soho. <line>","arts & sciences,humor & satire,social commentaries,history & politics"

10205,10806,"<line> <line>at hawthorn-time in wiltshire travellingin search of something chance would never bring,an old man’s face, by life and weather cutand coloured,—rough, brown, sweet as any nut,—a land face, sea-blue-eyed,—hung in my mindwhen i had left him many a mile behind.all he said was: “nobody can’t stop ’ee. it’sa footpath, right enough. you see those bitsof mounds—that’s where they opened up the barrowssixty years since, while i was scaring sparrows.they thought as there was something to find there,but couldn’t find it, by digging, anywhere.”to turn back then and seek him, where was the use?there were three manningfords,—abbots, bohun, and bruce:and whether alton, not manningford, it was,my memory could not decide, becausethere was both alton barnes and alton priors.all had their churches, graveyards, farms, and byres,lurking to one side up the paths and lanes,seldom well seen except by aeroplanes;and when bells rang, or pigs squealed, or cocks crowed,then only heard. ages ago the roadapproached. the people stood and looked and turned.nor asked it to come nearer, nor yet learnedto move out there and dwell in all men’s dust.and yet withal they shot the weathercock, justbecause ’twas he crowed out of tune, they said:so now the copper weathercock is dead.if they had reaped their dandelions and soldthem fairly, they could have afforded gold.many years passed, and i went back againamong those villages, and looked for menwho might have known my ancient. he himselfhad long been dead or laid upon the shelf,i thought. one man i asked about him roaredat my description: “’tis old bottlesfordhe means, bill.” but another said: “of course,it was jack button up at the white horse.he’s dead, sir, these three years.” this lasted tilla girl proposed walker of walker’s hill,“old adam walker. adam's point you’ll seemarked on the maps.” “that was her roguery,”the next man said. he was a squire’s sonwho loved wild bird and beast, and dog and gunfor killing them. he had loved them from his birth,one with another, as he loved the earth.“the man may be like button, or walker, orlike bottlesford, that you want, but far morehe sounds like one i saw when i was a child.i could almost swear to him. the man was wildand wandered. his home was where he was free.everybody has met one such man as he.does he keep clear old paths that no one usesbut once a lifetime when he loves or muses?he is english as this gate, these flowers, this mire.and when at eight years old lob-lie-by-the-firecame in my books, this was the man i saw.he has been in england as long as dove and daw,calling the wild cherry tree the merry tree,the rose campion bridget-in-her-bravery;and in a tender mood he, as i guess,christened one flower love-in-idleness,and while he walked from exeter to leedsone april called all cuckoo-flowers milkmaids.from him old herbal gerard learnt, as a boy,to name wild clematis the traveller’s-joy.our blackbirds sang no english till his eartold him they called his jan toy ‘pretty dear.’(she was jan toy the lucky, who, having losta shilling, and found a penny loaf, rejoiced.)for reasons of his own to him the wrenis jenny pooter. before all other men’twas he first called the hog’s back the hog’s back.that mother dunch’s buttocks should not lacktheir name was his care. he too could explaintotteridge and totterdown and juggler’s lane:he knows, if anyone. why tumbling bay,inland in kent, is called so, he might say.“but little he says compared with what he does.if ever a sage troubles him he will buzzlike a beehive to conclude the tedious fray:and the sage, who knows all languages, runs away.yet lob has thirteen hundred names for a fool,and though he never could spare time for schoolto unteach what the fox so well expressed,on biting the cock’s head off,—quietness is best,—he can talk quite as well as anyoneafter his thinking is forgot and done.he first of all told someone else’s wife,for a farthing she’d skin a flint and spoil a knifeworth sixpence skinning it. she heard him speak:‘she had a face as long as a wet week’said he, telling the tale in after years.with blue smock and with gold rings in his ears,sometimes he is a pedlar, not too poorto keep his wit. this is tall tom that borethe logs in, and with shakespeare in the hallonce talked, when icicles hung by the wall.as herne the hunter he has known hard times.on sleepless nights he made up weather rhymeswhich others spoilt. and, hob being then his name,he kept the hog that thought the butcher cameto bring his breakfast ‘you thought wrong,’ said hob.when there were kings in kent this very lob,whose sheep grew fat and he himself grew merry,wedded the king’s daughter of canterbury;for he alone, unlike squire, lord, and king,watched a night by her without slumbering;he kept both waking. when he was but a ladhe won a rich man’s heiress, deaf, dumb, and sad,by rousing her to laugh at him. he carriedhis donkey on his back. so they were married.and while he was a little cobbler’s boyhe tricked the giant coming to destroyshrewsbury by flood. ‘and how far is it yet?’the giant asked in passing. ‘i forget;but see these shoes i‘ve worn out on the roadand we’re not there yet.’ he emptied out his loadof shoes for mending. the giant let fall from his spadethe earth for damming severn, and thus madethe wrekin hill; and little ercall hillrose where the giant scraped his boots. while stillso young, our jack was chief of gotham’s sages.but long before he could have been wise, agesearlier than this, while he grew thick and strongand ate his bacon, or, at times, sang a songand merely smelt it, as jack the giant-killerhe made a name. he too ground up the miller,the yorkshireman who ground men’s bones for flour.“do you believe jack dead before his hour?or that his name is walker, or bottlesford,or button, a mere clown, or squire, or lord?the man you saw,—lob-lie-by-the-fire, jack cade,jack smith, jack moon, poor jack of every trade,young jack, or old jack, or jack what-d’ye-call,jack-in-the-hedge, or robin-run-by-the-wall,robin hood, ragged robin, lazy bob,one of the lords of no man’s land, good lob,—although he was seen dying at waterloo,hastings, agincourt, and sedgemoor too,—lives yet. he never will admit he is deadtill millers cease to grind men’s bones for bread,not till our weathercock crows once againand i remove my house out of the laneon to the road.” with this he disappearedin hazel and thorn tangled with old-man’s-beard.but one glimpse of his back, as there he stood,choosing his way, proved him of old jack’s blood,young jack perhaps, and now a wiltshiremanas he has oft been since his days began. <line>","living,activities,travels & journeys,mythology & folklore"

10324,3181,"<line> <line>this is the light of the mind, cold and planetary.the trees of the mind are black. their irregular branches, <line> <line>like broken arms backlit from mri dye, offset by yearning. <line> <line>they take form in ways only experts can decipher.the light is blue. the observation of the alien doctor <line> <line>flickers in his iris, furnace gaslight burning like a pagan memorial.the grasses unload their griefs on my feet as if i were god, <line> <line>i pity their need for idolatry. it bares itself only to the void of me,prickling my ankles and murmuring of their humility. <line> <line>i am unable to convince them otherwise. <line> <line>i hear them mew and compete as if for a rough teat's clear nutrition. <line> <line>foolish rule of the organic, uncultured and out of control. <line> <line>i am mum and tidy as a nun in comparison. <line> <line>though capable of devastation are my desires which punish <line> <line>the landscape with recrimination, uprooting the hedges. <line> <line>they swallow fire, speak in four languages, and love no one. <line> <line>i shudder with pride as they push themselves back to their origin, <line> <line>to the scraped-out bottom of a uterine nothing; <line> <line>this hard loneliness, skull-solid, pushed back into vagueness <line> <line>until it succumbs as if overwhelmed by barbiturates. fumy, spiritous mists inhabit this placeseparated from my house by a row of headstones. <line> <line>its green vapors trigger an olfactory déjà vu like a recurrent nightmare. <line> <line>i envy the buried faces finally freed from worry and ailment, <line> <line>from the pressure to remain always forward-thinking. <line> <line>i picture their release, the prostrate bodies floating up as if levitated. <line> <line>what peace, what stillness was shoveled onto their pine box beds <line> <line>where darkness then dropped, all at once, final as an execution.i simply cannot see where there is to get to.the moon is no door. it is a face in its own right,white as a knuckle and terribly upset. i identify with its nausea. <line> <line>it meets me in the mirror uninvited, this face beneath my face, <line> <line>restless and unwilling. it formulates inside me like a kicking fetus <line> <line>and refuses to be ignored. it haunts and threatens like a past trauma.it drags the sea after it like a dark crime; mute as a mug shot, <line> <line>it is quiet, like someone suffocated who suddenly stops struggling. <line> <line>i recognize in its warm death the expression of the starvingwith the o-gape of complete despair. i live here. <line> <line>against me a force, not stronger or more intelligent, <line> <line>but more adaptable to poor weather like dandelions. <line> <line>i can feel it whittle me down to horse feed pellets. <line> <line>i'm being winnowed out of the earth's circulation, <line> <line>with a pairing incremental as this winter's passing.twice on sunday the bells startle the sky—eight great tongues affirming the resurrection. <line> <line>i'm forced to listen to the liturgical lecturing, <line> <line>truant student of a catechism i loathe.at the end, they soberly bong out their names; <line> <line>myths and ideals i could never bring myself to believe in, <line> <line>my prayers, the self-flagellation of unrequited love.the yew tree points up like a new england steeple.it has a gothic shape. it used to remind me of home.the eyes lift after it and find the moon. <line> <line>once fragile as rice paper, it hangs static and tough <line> <line>like a noose signifying more hardship ahead— <line> <line>interrogating flashlight that hurts my eyes. <line> <line>now no home exists—just an empty bed, <line> <line>a pile of mangled sheets atop a dark wood floor, <line> <line>like snow atop the frozen mud tracks of hoof and wheel.the moon is my mother. she is not sweet like mary. <line> <line>she licks her white feathers and stares back with one eye <line> <line>vicious as a swan about to bite.her blue garments unloose small bats and owls. <line> <line>i watch, my leg caught in the truth of my life <line> <line>where beyond human emotion i've traveled at this point.how i would like to believe in tenderness— <line> <line>in those symbolic unions that elicit sweet concepts: <line> <line>mother and child, father and daughter, husband and wife.the face of the effigy, gentled by candles, <line> <line>its cheekbones flushed with an afterworld favoritismbending, on me in particular, its mild eyes; <line> <line>hair waving, mouth parted in mid-speech like drowned ophelia.i have fallen a long way. i lie at the bottom, smashed <line> <line>like a dinner plate against kitchen tile, china chips and jagged bits. <line> <line>i lie at the bottom, shattered and dangerous, looking up <line> <line>with a baby's stunned engrossment. i'm moving closer to pluto and mars.clouds are flowering blue and mystical over the face of the stars,— <line> <line>it will not be quick. death drinks me in, slow as syrup.inside the church, the saints will be all blue. <line> <line>they've ascended into heaven's oxygen-deprived morgue.floating on their delicate feet over the cold pews,their hands and faces stiff with holiness, <line> <line>mannequins perennially enacting the nativity in a wax museum.the moon sees nothing of this. she is bald and wild <line> <line>as one dying of cancer. she begs for relief, but her pillow-muffled <line> <line>shrieks disperse with the other sounds and shadows of the night. <line> <line>we are left alone, her cadaver face, gaunt and grim, prescient of mine.and the message of the yew tree is blackness—blackness and silence. <line> <line> sylvia plath, ""the moon and the yew tree,"" <line> <line> ariel (new york: harper & row, 1961) <line> <line> <line>","living,death,health & illness,the body,the mind,relationships,family & ancestors,nature,stars, planets, heavens,religion,faith & doubt,the spiritual"

10326,1991,"<line> <line>one sunday morning, <line> <line>instead of studying the illiad, <line> <line>i escaped with bino to florence, <line> <line>to see what miracles the aviator manissero <line> <line>would perform. <line> <line> <line> <line>whether he would demonstrate the art of daedalus <line> <line>or the folly of icarus. <line> <line> <line> <line>we found the whole city festooned with banners <line> <line>on which was written: today we fly. <line> <line>they were everywhere: via cerretani, <line> <line>via cavour, via calzaioli, along the embankments. <line> <line>there was even one stretched across the arno <line> <line>with an enormous red today we fly <line> <line>reflected in the yellow water <line> <line> like the famous in hoc signo vinces of ponte milvio. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>we almost expected that florence itself <line> <line> <line> <line>would lift off, <line> <line> <line> <line>with its towers, its statues, its red roofs, <line> <line> <line> <line>with its cathedral's nodding cupola <line> <line> <line> <line>rising slowly through the clouds <line> <line> <line> <line>like a balloon. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>every window, doorway and marketplace <line> <line> <line> <line>was crammed with upturned faces, <line> <line> <line> <line>scanning the sky for some sign <line> <line> <line> <line>of the direction the wind might take, <line> <line> <line> <line>and whether there would come with it <line> <line> <line> <line>the smell of rain. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>we were most afraid of the wind from bologna, <line> <line> <line> <line>proud enemy to the north. <line> <line> <line> <line>almost as bad would have been the wind from the south, <line> <line> <line> <line>from empoli, called the scirocco; <line> <line> <line> <line>or petrarch's east wind from arezzo, <line> <line> <line> <line>with its grecian-accented gusts. <line> <line> <line> <line>but even a soft westerly breeze from pistoia— <line> <line> <line> <line>even that sweet breath from the ballads of cino, <line> <line> <line> <line>full of dolce stil novo— <line> <line> <line> <line>would have spelled disaster. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>luckily the sky that sunday was clear, <line> <line> <line> <line>and the air was still. <line> <line> <line> <line>the leaves on the trees around the parade ground <line> <line> <line> <line>stood at ease, <line> <line> <line> <line>and the outlines of the hills were crisp, <line> <line> <line> <line>sharply etched in the crystalline air. just wait. today we really will fly, <line> <line> <line> <line>said bino with a smile. <line> <line> <line> <line>for overnight today we fly had become a catchphrase, <line> <line> <line> <line>fit for every occasion: <line> <line> <line> <line>for a straw hat rolling along the pavement; <line> <line> <line> <line>for a parasol blown around the corner; <line> <line> <line> <line>for a dress tangled up between the knees, <line> <line> <line> <line>or blown flapping like a flag around rounded hips. <line> <line> <line> <line>it was the happy time of the first aeroplanes, <line> <line> <line> <line>before the war <line> <line> <line> <line>when it was fashionable for women <line> <line> <line> <line>to wear enormous hairdos <line> <line> <line> <line>as wide as their dresses were narrow. <line> <line> <line> <line>and those gigantic wings of hair, <line> <line> <line> <line>which were the objects of so many of our teenage jokes, <line> <line>have remained braided together in my heart <line> <line> <line> <line>with the fluttering today we fly: <line> <line> <line> <line>maliciously good-natured mementos <line> <line> <line> <line>of my adolescence. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>we hurried over the parade grounds, <line> <line> <line> <line>and there was manissero <line> <line> <line> <line>crouched in the cockpit of his machine: <line> <line> <line> <line>a contraption of woven reeds and papery cloth, <line> <line> <line> <line>with a motor so small it made you think a horsefly <line> <line> <line> <line>was pinned to the frame behind his shoulders. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>the crowd had assembled, holding its breath, <line> <line> <line> <line>waiting for the miracle to happen, <line> <line> <line> <line>when suddenly the leaves began to tremble, <line> <line> <line> <line>and the blades of grass of nod. <line> <line> <line> <line>a few tiny white clouds sprouted <line> <line> <line> <line>like windowsills on monte morello, <line> <line> <line> <line>and the women's wings of hair began to come untucked <line> <line> <line> <line>from their padded nests of false braids. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>manissero jumped out of his cockpit <line> <line> <line> <line>at the first sign of this unfortunate breeze, <line> <line> <line> <line>waved amicably to the crowd with a gloved hand, <line> <line> <line> <line>and yanked off his leather helmet <line> <line> <line> <line>while a banner was unfurled above the grandstands: <line> <line> <line> <line> because of unsettled weather, today we will not fly. <line> <line> <line> <line>it was hard to imagine anything more settled <line> <line> <line> <line>than the weather that day: <line> <line> <line> <line>a magnificent, paradisiacal sunday in spring. <line> <line> <line> <line>but all it took was this delicate breeze, <line> <line> <line> <line>this perfumed zephyr from pistoia, <line> <line> <line> <line>to spoil everything. <line> <line> <line> <line>we returned to prato with heavy hearts, <line> <line> <line> <line>and i took up my study of the abandoned illiad, <line> <line> <line> <line>quiet and discouraged. <line> <line> <line> <line>thursday morning the rumor began to spread <line> <line> <line> <line>that the following sunday, <line> <line> <line> <line>if the weather was favorable, <line> <line> <line> <line>manissero would attempt to fly <line> <line> <line> <line>from florence to prato and back: <line> <line> <line> <line>thirty kilometers round trip! <line> <line> <line> <line>by saturday, via magnolfi, the corso, <line> <line> <line> <line>via del'oche, via firenzuola—all the streets of prato <line> <line> <line> <line>were crisscrossed with white banners <line> <line> <line> <line>carrying those fateful words: today we fly. <line> <line> <line> <line>by noon sunday <line> <line> <line> <line>rivers of people from the surrounding the countryside <line> <line> <line> <line>were flooding into the city through its five gates, <line> <line> <line> <line>and by three o'clock <line> <line> <line> <line>the cathedral square was awash <line> <line> <line> <line>with a restless and noisy crowd, <line> <line> <line> <line>pale, perspiring, noses in the air. <line> <line> <line> <line>i stood among them with my classmates, <line> <line> <line> <line>all of us impatient, barely kept in check <line> <line> <line> <line>by the stern gaze of our principal <line> <line> <line> <line>and the softer reprimands of the teachers. <line> <line> <line> <line>we began to hear a new word: velivolo! <line> <line> <line> <line>dancing above the buzz of the crowd. <line> <line> <line> <line>but that name for aeroplane, recently coined by d'annunzio, <line> <line> <line> <line>seemed too delicate for the gaping mouths of dumbstruck farmers: <line> <line> <line> <line>it was still fresh, still smelled of varnish, <line> <line> <line> <line>and was as sweet and sharp in the mouth <line> <line> <line> <line>as mint candy. velivolo! <line> <line> <line> <line>suddenly a white wing appeared in the blue sky <line> <line> <line> <line>and the reed-and-paper bird <line> <line> <line> <line>grew larger, came closer, <line> <line> <line> <line>hovered over the cathedral square. <line> <line> <line> <line>a cry, only one, but from a thousand throats; <line> <line> <line> <line>a cry more of fear than joy: <line> <line> <line> <line>then sudden silence, <line> <line> <line> <line>bursting with anguish. <line> <line> <line> <line>manissero was perhaps two hundred meters above our heads, <line> <line> <line> <line>and it seemed miraculous. <line> <line> <line> <line>miraculous not just because he was flying, <line> <line> <line> <line>but because he was flying over prato, <line> <line> <line> <line>in the virgin sky of prato! <line> <line> <line> <line>which only the kites of children had dared to caress <line> <line> <line> <line>until today. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>as long as the flying was over florence, <line> <line> <line> <line>things were fine: <line> <line> <line> <line>certain facts, in florence, are understandable, <line> <line> <line> <line>are legitimate, and fit within in the logic of history. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>but over prato! <line> <line> <line> <line>over prato where for centuries now <line> <line> <line> <line>nothing miraculous had happened. <line> <line> <line> <line>not on the ground, <line> <line> <line> <line>and not in the sky. <line> <line> <line> <line>especially not in the sky. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>over prato! <line> <line> <line> <line>where it seemed that miracles had become impossible, <line> <line> <line> <line>caught as we were <line> <line> <line> <line>between the historic pride of florence <line> <line> <line> <line>and the ancient jealousy of pistoia. <line> <line> <line> <line>sacrificed, <line> <line> <line> <line>reduced to poor relations, <line> <line> <line> <line>robbed not only of everything that we had, <line> <line> <line> <line>which would have been bad enough, <line> <line> <line> <line>but of everything we might have wanted to have. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>yet here was manissero flying in our sky, <line> <line> <line> <line>in the neglected sky of prato. <line> <line> <line> <line>and he was flying, or so it seemed, <line> <line> <line> <line>better than he might have flown in the sky of florence. <line> <line> <line> <line>better than in any other sky in tuscany! <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>after a moment, though, the suspicion began to grow <line> <line> <line> <line>that he might fly as far as pistoia. <line> <line> <line> <line>everyone held their breath, <line> <line> <line> <line>balanced on one foot, <line> <line> <line> <line>hearts stopped between beats: <line> <line> <line> <line> the treacherous sky of pistoia! <line> <line> <line> <line>some us took out our keys, <line> <line> <line> <line>ready to rattle them against such a betrayal. <line> <line> <line> <line>the rest of us set our lips <line> <line> <line> <line>to whistle in defiance. <line> <line> <line> <line>but manissero veered to the right, <line> <line> <line> <line>and after a wide turn over prato <line> <line> <line> <line>he headed back toward florence. <line> <line> <line> <line>the city detonated with joy. <line> <line> <line> <line>i lost myself in the crowd, beyond thought, <line> <line> <line> <line>proud citizen of prato to my bones. <line> <line> <line> <line>it wouldn't be too much to say that all of us, that day, <line> <line> <line> <line>felt we held a piece of sky in our hands. <line> <line> <line> <line>that night, in my dreams, the achaean army, <line> <line> <line> <line>assembling beneath the walls of troy, <line> <line> <line> <line>came to a halt, astonished at what lay before them: <line> <line> <line> <line>stretching from tower to tower <line> <line> <line> <line>immense white banners <line> <line> <line> <line>on which great red letters spelled out: today we fly. <line> <line> <line> <line>and then troy, the city of priam— <line> <line> <line> <line>which from a distance resembled nothing more than prato— <line> <line> <line> <line>detached itself gently from the earth, <line> <line> <line> <line>hovered with its banners snapping in the breeze, <line> <line> <line> <line>and drifted away into the clear sky, <line> <line> <line> <line>swinging gently from side to side. <line> <line> <line> <line>maddened achilles ran along below, commanding: stop! stop! <line> <line> <line> <line>and from the buzz of his accent <line> <line> <line> <line>you might have thought he was from pistoia. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>beloved priam, from the top of the trojan gates. <line> <line> <line> <line>answered sweetly: too late. too late. <line> <line> <line> <line>and his voice had all soft accents of prato, <line> <line> <line> <line>taking flight.

10330,1534,"<line> <line>in order to upgrade the community’s appreciation of poetry during the international year of cultural enrichment stage 2, members of the state’s library progress committee decided to establish a small library of t-shirts on which would be printed quality verse in vivid, bold colours and lettering. the poems would be selected on the basis of one of three qualities: is the poem poignant, perspicacious, or pithy. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>given the respectably researched fact that the wearing of words on t-shirts expresses a deep psychic desire for an intimate union of word and flesh, (and bear in mind the way “logo” nudges towards “logos”) it is not surprising that this library of t-shirts has been a great success. no one seems to mind borrowing pre-worn clothing. of course the library’s washing and ironing staff maintain the t-shirts in excellent condition. even after ten borrowings the shirts look brand new. and considering the phenomenal success of andrew lloyd webber’s “cats” it is no shock revelation that t.s. eliot’s “hollow men” has proved to be the library’s most popular t-shirt so far. in fact there are now eight copies of this shirt on loan, most in metallic or fluoro colours. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>a couple of the more entrepreneurial of the library’s progress committee members are leading the push for diversification of the library’s poetry program, into neck to knee anti-uv swimwear, with maybe slessor, shelly and stevie smith prints for starters; and into underpants, with their multiple attractions. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>while the committee feels both these garments could increase poetry’s appeal, they are worried about the practicability of adding these garments to the t-shirt poetry collection. would many members want to borrow preworn underpants, however compelling the poems’ cadences and metaphors; while the wear and tear on the swimming costume fabric via chlorine and salt water would perhaps be too great. however they are interested in marketing and selling these articles from a stall in the library’s foyer. the only committee member unenthusiastic regarding this proposal is an optometrist who has raised the issue of eye damage if the typeface of the lines of verse on the underpants were too small. a solution in the form of large print haikus is being considered. <line>","arts & sciences,humor & satire,poetry & poets,social commentaries,popular culture"

even though the street is narrow the bicycle rolls on, rolls on against the spray. when you turn your head and see my hand, my hook snagged in a struggle of desire, the sun has turned immense in your eyes again. you make for the little house already in view, already at the edge of the curve...a naked man in lamplight is a magnificent animal: his pointy shoulders jut out and cut off the light. a line of fuzz descends from his navel to where the darkness begins, where the skin tightens like the skin of a fig. his body—your body—is an arc i want to tighten, to overcome, to conquer. hidden behind a tree, i can see your eyes again. the mississippi is a big river with many tributaries. the arc tightens and closes. i throw an arm over you, a leg, a hand, a lip, hallucinations, an ear—as usual. my body moves on. the mississippi is a big river with many tributaries. its water burns in my thighs, in the course of my dreams: the mississippi is a deep and torrential river situated in the united states, it is born in lake itasca, passes through st. paul, st. louis, memphis, new orleans, traverses 3,780 kilometers and slides and slides through a wide delta to the gulf of mexico. i’m in geography class. i like this class. the world just barely fits in my head. the map hangs before me with its spokes and points. someone made that all up, just to make me think i belong to one of those zones out there. all those castles and fortifications to toy with, the beginnings of everything that seems to be reality, but isn’t, because we’re not outside but inside the globe, that huge globe so stubborn in its sufficiency, and even far from the classroom nothing’s different: there’s just the idea of that transparent globe that is my image of the world, always turning, imperfect and constant inside me. i like the maps and the instability of the geography that situates places in my head. i like using graph paper to plot the latitudes and longitudes i can’t measure. i also like the geography professor, whose eyes i must constantly avoid in order not to drown myself. he doesn’t know, he can’t imagine, that while he lectures, while he looks at me, i draw fish in my notebook to throw in his river. the boy behind me won’t stop looking at me, and whatever one does the others all follow, watching from the corners of their eyes. that’s why i’m going to fold the page away from his gaze and make a true map where he won’t find me, alone at my desk in the middle of the world...in the middle of the lake there’s a boat and we’re three—although the third may have already vanished for us—and i want to paddle and sit in the center. you’ve taken off your shirt: the landscape appears and disappears. when i take the oars you want to teach me how to row over the edge. you try to teach me: you take my hands—you’re behind and above me. my fingers are lost in the middle of the boat. i’m wearing faded jeans and carrying a purple parasol. the oar descends toward the deep and tangles with seaweed. my hair hangs surly and limp on my wet shoulders. we try to steer but go nowhere. you explain the roundness of the earth; the sharpened tip of the compass needle, always precise, marking contours, lines, limits. the shadow and truth of your body in the landscape: appearances and disappearances when you try to comprehend the possible across great distances, the symmetry, forgetfulness, incarnation in other beings: animals, plants, and later, men once again. you taught me all this, but i’m not a map and i hold still. i abandon my shoes and my dread of nearing the end: the oar descends toward the deep, it is september. we don’t move. i keep still to be different, that’s why... <line>","living,the body,love,desire,activities,travels & journeys,nature,fall,seas, rivers, & streams"

whose prayses having slept in silence long, me, all too meane, the sacred muse areeds to blazon broad emongst her learned throng: fierce warres and faithful loves shall moralize my song. helpe then, o holy virgin chiefe of nine, thy weaker novice to performe thy will, lay forth out of thine everlasting scryne the antique rolles, which there lye hidden still, of faerie knights and fairest tanaquill, whom that most noble briton prince so long sought through the world, and suffered so much ill, that i must rue his undeserved wrong: o helpe thou my weake wit, and sharpen my dull tong. and thou most dreaded impe of highest jove, faire venus sonne, that with thy cruell dart at that good knight so cunningly didst rove, that glorious fire it kindled in his hart, lay now thy deadly heben bow apart, and with thy mother milde come to mine ayde: come both, and with you bring triumphant mart, in loves and gentle jollities arrayd, after his murdrous spoiles and bloudy rage allayd. and with them eke, o goddesse heavenly bright, mirrour of grace and majestie divine, great lady of the greatest isle, whose light like phoebus lampe throughout the world doth shine, shed thy faire beames into my feeble eyne, and raise my thoughts too humble and too vile, to thinke of that true glorious type of thine, the argument of mine afflicted stile: the which to heare, vouchsafe, o dearest dred a-while. i a gentle knight was pricking on the plaine, y cladd in mightie armes and silver shielde, wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remaine, the cruell markes of many a bloudy fielde; yet armes till that time did he never wield: his angry steede did chide his foming bitt, as much disdayning to the curbe to yield: full jolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt, as one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt. ii but on his brest a bloudie crosse he bore, the deare remembrance of his dying lord, for whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore, and dead as living ever him ador'd: upon his shield the like was also scor'd, for soveraine hope, which in his helpe he had: right faithfull true he was in deede and word, but of his cheere did seeme too solemne sad; yet nothing did he dread, but ever was ydrad. iii upon a great adventure he was bond, that greatest gloriana to him gave, that greatest glorious queene of faerie lond, to winne him worship, and her grace to have, which of all earthly things he most did crave; and ever as he rode, his hart did earne to prove his puissance in battell brave upon his foe, and his new force to learne; upon his foe, a dragon horrible and stearne. iv a lovely ladie rode him faire beside, upon a lowly asse more white then snow, yet she much whiter, but the same did hide under a vele, that wimpled was full low, and over all a blacke stole she did throw, as one that inly mournd: so was she sad, and heavie sat upon her palfrey slow; seemed in heart some hidden care she had, and by her in a line a milke white lambe she lad. v so pure an innocent, as that same lambe, she was in life and every vertuous lore, and by descent from royall lynage came of ancient kings and queenes, that had of yore their scepters stretcht from east to westerne shore, and all the world in their subjection held; till that infernall feend with foule uprore forwasted all their land, and them expeld: whom to avenge, she had this knight from far compeld. vi behind her farre away a dwarfe did lag, that lasie seemd in being ever last, or wearied with bearing of her bag of needments at his backe. thus as they past, the day with cloudes was suddeine overcast, and angry jove an hideous storme of raine did poure into his lemans lap so fast, that every wight to shrowd it did constrain, and this faire couple eke to shroud themselves were fain. vii enforst to seeke some covert nigh at hand, a shadie grove not far away they spide, that promist ayde the tempest to withstand: whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride, did spred so broad, that heavens light did hide, not perceable with power of any starre: and all within were pathes and alleies wide, with footing worne, and leading inward farre: faire harbour that them seemes; so in they entred arre. viii and foorth they passe, with pleasure forward led, joying to heare the birdes sweete harmony, which therein shrouded from the tempest dred, seemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky. much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy, the sayling pine, the cedar proud and tall, the vine-prop elme, the poplar never dry, the builder oake, sole king of forrests all, the aspine good for staves, the cypresse funerall. ix the laurell, meed of mightie conquerours and poets sage, the firre that weepeth still, the willow worne of forlorne paramours, the eugh obedient to the benders will, the birch for shaftes, the sallow for the mill, the mirrhe sweete bleeding in the bitter wound, the warlike beech, the ash for nothing ill, the fruitfull olive, and the platane round, the carver holme, the maple seeldom inward sound. x led with delight, they thus beguile the way, untill the blustring storme is overblowne; when weening to returne, whence they did stray, they cannot find that path, which first was showne, but wander too and fro in wayes unknowne, furthest from end then, when they neerest weene, that makes them doubt, their wits be not their owne: so many pathes, so many turnings seene, that which of them to take, in diverse doubt they been. xi at last resolving forward still to fare, till that some end they finde or in or out, that path they take, that beaten seemd most bare, and like to lead the labyrinth about; which when by tract they hunted had throughout, at length it brought them to a hollow cave, amid the thickest woods. the champion stout eftsoones dismounted from his courser brave, and to the dwarfe a while his needlesse spere he gave. xii be well aware, quoth then that ladie milde, least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash provoke: the danger hid, the place unknowne and wilde, breeds dreadfull doubts: oft fire is without smoke, and perill without show: therefore your stroke sir knight with-hold, till further triall made. ah ladie (said he) shame were to revoke the forward footing for an hidden shade: vertue gives her selfe light, through darkenesse for to wade. xiii yea but (quoth she) the perill of this place i better wot then you, though now too late to wish you backe returne with foule disgrace, yet wisedome warnes, whilest foot is in the gate, to stay the steppe, ere forced to retrate. this is the wandring wood, this errours den, a monster vile, whom god and man does hate: therefore i read beware. fly fly (quoth then the fearefull dwarfe:) this is no place for living men. xiv but full of fire and greedy hardiment, the youthfull knight could not for ought be staide, but forth unto the darksome hole he went, and looked in: his glistring armor made a litle glooming light, much like a shade, by which he saw the ugly monster plaine, halfe like a serpent horribly displaide, but th'other halfe did womans shape retaine, most lothsom, filthie, foule, and full of vile disdaine. xv and as she lay upon the durtie ground, her huge long taile her den all overspred, yet was in knots and many boughtes upwound, pointed with mortall sting. of her there bred a thousand yong ones, which she dayly fed, sucking upon her poisonous dugs, eachone of sundry shapes, yet all ill favored: soone as that uncouth light upon them shone, into her mouth they crept, and suddain all were gone. xvi their dam upstart, out of her den effraide, and rushed forth, hurling her hideous taile about her cursed head, whose folds displaid were stretcht now forth at length without entraile. she lookt about, and seeing one in mayle armed to point, sought backe to turne againe; for light she hated as the deadly bale, ay wont in desert darknesse to remaine, where plaine none might her see, nor she see any plaine. xvii which when the valiant elfe perceiv'd, he lept as lyon fierce upon the flying pray, and with his trenchand blade her boldly kept from turning backe, and forced her to stay: therewith enrag'd she loudly gan to bray, and turning fierce, her speckled taile advaunst, threatning her angry sting, him to dismay: who nought aghast, his mightie hand enhaunst: the stroke down from her head unto her shoulder glaunst. xviii much daunted with that dint, her sence was dazd, yet kindling rage, her selfe she gathered round, and all attonce her beastly body raizd with doubled forces high above the ground: tho wrapping up her wrethed sterne arownd, lept fierce upon his shield, and her huge traine all suddenly about his body wound, that hand or foot to stirre he strove in vaine: god helpe the man so wrapt in errours endlesse traine. xix his lady sad to see his sore constraint, cride out, now now sir knight, shew what ye bee, add faith unto your force, and be not faint: strangle her, else she sure will strangle thee. that when he heard, in great perplexitie, his gall did grate for griefe and high disdaine, and knitting all his force got one hand free, wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine, that soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine. xx therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw a floud of poyson horrible and blacke, full of great lumpes of flesh and gobbets raw, which stunck so vildly, that it forst him slacke his grasping hold, and from her turne him backe: her vomit full of bookes and papers was, with loathly frogs and toades, which eyes did lacke, and creeping sought way in the weedy gras: her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has. xxi as when old father nilus gins to swell with timely pride above the aegyptian vale, his fattie waves do fertile slime outwell, and overflow each plaine and lowly dale: but when his later spring gins to avale, huge heapes of mudd he leaves, wherein there breed ten thousand kindes of creatures, partly male and partly female of his fruitfull seed; such ugly monstrous shapes elsewhere may no man reed. xxii the same so sore annoyed has the knight, that welnigh choked with the deadly stinke, his forces faile, ne can no longer fight. whose corage when the feend perceiv'd to shrinke, she poured forth out of her hellish sinke her fruitfull cursed spawne of serpents small, deformed monsters, fowle, and blacke as inke, which swarming all about his legs did crall, and him encombred sore, but could not hurt at all. xxiii as gentle shepheard in sweete even-tide, when ruddy phoebus gins to welke in west, high on an hill, his flocke to vewen wide, markes which do byte their hasty supper best; a cloud of combrous gnattes do him molest, all striving to infixe their feeble stings, that from their noyance he no where can rest, but with his clownish hands their tender wings he brusheth oft, and oft doth mar their murmurings. xxiv thus ill bestedd, and fearefull more of shame, then of the certaine perill he stood in, halfe furious unto his foe he came, resolv'd in minde all suddenly to win, or soone to lose, before he once would lin; and strooke at her with more then manly force, that from her body full of filthie sin he raft her hatefull head without remorse; a streame of cole black bloud forth gushed from her corse. xxv her scattred brood, soone as their parent deare they saw so rudely falling to the ground, groning full deadly, all with troublous feare, gathred themselves about her body round, weening their wonted entrance to have found at her wide mouth: but being there withstood they flocked all about her bleeding wound, and sucked up their dying mothers blood, making her death their life, and eke her hurt their good. xxvi that detestable sight him much amazde, to see th'unkindly impes of heaven accurst, devoure their dam; on whom while so he gazd, having all satisfide their bloudy thurst, their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst, and bowels gushing forth: well worthy end of such as drunke her life, the which them nurst; now needeth him no lenger labour spend, his foes have slaine themselves, with whom he should contend. xxvii his ladie seeing all, that chaunst, from farre approcht in hast to greet his victorie, and said, faire knight, borne under happy starre, who see your vanquisht foes before you lye: well worthy be you of that armorie, wherein ye have great glory wonne this day, and proov'd your strength on a strong enimie, your first adventure: many such i pray, and henceforth ever wish, that like succeed it may. xxviii then mounted he upon his steede againe, and with the lady backward sought to wend; that path he kept, which beaten was most plame, ne ever would to any by-way bend, but still did follow one unto the end, the which at last out of the wood them brought. so forward on his way (with god to frend) he passed forth, and new adventure sought; long way he travelled, before he heard of ought. xxix at length they chaunst to meet upon the way an aged sire, in long blacke weedes yclad, his feete all bare, his beard all hoarie gray, and by his belt his booke he hanging had; sober he seemde, and very sagely sad, and to the ground his eyes were lowly bent, simple in shew, and voyde of malice bad, and all the way he prayed, as he went, and often knockt his brest, as one that did repent. xxx he faire the knight saluted, louting low, who faire him quited, as that courteous was: and after asked him, if he did know of straunge adventures, which abroad did pas. ah my deare sonne (quoth he) how should, alas, silly old man, that lives in hidden cell, bidding his beades all day for his trespas, tydings of warre and worldly trouble tell? with holy father sits not with such things to mell. xxxi but if of daunger which hereby doth dwell, and homebred evill ye desire to heare, of a straunge man i can you tidings tell, that wasteth all this countrey farre and neare. of such (said he) i chiefly do inquere, and shall you well reward to shew the place, in which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare: for to all knighthood it is foule disgrace, that such a cursed creature lives so long a space. xxxii far hence (quoth he) in wastfull wildernesse his dwelling is, by which no living wight may ever passe, but thorough great distresse. now (sayd the lady) draweth toward night, and well i wote, that of your later fight ye all forwearied be: for what so strong, but wanting rest will also want of might? the sunne that measures heaven all day long, at night doth baite his steedes the ocean waves emong. xxxiii then with the sunne take sir, your timely rest, and with new day new worke at once begin: untroubled night they say gives counsell best. right well sir knight ye have advised bin, (quoth then that aged man;) the way to win is wisely to advise: now day is spent; therefore with me ye may take up your in for this same night. the knight was well content: so with that godly father to his home they went. xxxiv a little lowly hermitage it was, downe in a dale, hard by a forests side, far from resort of people, that did pas in travell to and froe: a little wyde there was an holy chappell edifyde, wherein the hermite dewly wont to say his holy things each morne and eventyde: thereby a christall streame did gently play, which from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway. xxxv arrived there, the little house they fill, ne looke for entertainement, where none was: rest is their feast, and all things at their will; the noblest mind the best contentment has. with faire discourse the evening so they pas: for that old man of pleasing wordes had store, and well could file his tongue as smooth as glas; he told of saintes and popes, and evermore he strowd an ave-mary after and before. xxxvi the drouping night thus creepeth on them fast, and the sad humour loading their eye liddes, as messenger of morpheus on them cast sweet slombring deaw, the which to sleepe them biddes. unto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes: where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes, he to his study goes, and there amiddes his magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes, he seekes out mighty charmes, to trouble sleepy mindes. xxxvii then choosing out few wordes most horrible, (let none them read) thereof did verses frame, with which and other spelles like terrible, he bad awake blacke plutoes griesly dame, and cursed heaven, and spake reprochfull shame of highest god, the lord of life and light; a bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name great gorgon, prince of darknesse and dead night, at which cocytus quakes, and styx is put to flight. xxxviii and forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred legions of sprights, the which like little flyes fluttring about his ever damned hed, a-waite whereto their service he applyes, to aide his friends, or fray his enimies: of those he chose out two, the falsest twoo, and fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes;

'by thy long grey beard and glittering eye, now wherefore stopp'st thou me? the bridegroom's doors are opened wide, and i am next of kin; the guests are met, the feast is set: may'st hear the merry din.' he holds him with his skinny hand, 'there was a ship,' quoth he. 'hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!' eftsoons his hand dropt he. he holds him with his glittering eye— the wedding-guest stood still, and listens like a three years' child: the mariner hath his will. the wedding-guest sat on a stone: he cannot choose but hear; and thus spake on that ancient man, the bright-eyed mariner. 'the ship was cheered, the harbour cleared, merrily did we drop below the kirk, below the hill, below the lighthouse top. the sun came up upon the left, out of the sea came he! and he shone bright, and on the right went down into the sea. higher and higher every day, till over the mast at noon—' the wedding-guest here beat his breast, for he heard the loud bassoon. the bride hath paced into the hall, red as a rose is she; nodding their heads before her goes the merry minstrelsy. the wedding-guest he beat his breast, yet he cannot choose but hear; and thus spake on that ancient man, the bright-eyed mariner. and now the storm-blast came, and he was tyrannous and strong: he struck with his o'ertaking wings, and chased us south along. with sloping masts and dipping prow, as who pursued with yell and blow still treads the shadow of his foe, and forward bends his head, the ship drove fast, loud roared the blast, and southward aye we fled. and now there came both mist and snow, and it grew wondrous cold: and ice, mast-high, came floating by, as green as emerald. and through the drifts the snowy clifts did send a dismal sheen: nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken— the ice was all between. the ice was here, the ice was there, the ice was all around: it cracked and growled, and roared and howled, like noises in a swound! at length did cross an albatross, thorough the fog it came; as if it had been a christian soul, we hailed it in god's name. it ate the food it ne'er had eat, and round and round it flew. the ice did split with a thunder-fit; the helmsman steered us through! and a good south wind sprung up behind; the albatross did follow, and every day, for food or play, came to the mariner's hollo! in mist or cloud, on mast or shroud, it perched for vespers nine; whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white, glimmered the white moon-shine.' 'god save thee, ancient mariner! from the fiends, that plague thee thus!— why look'st thou so?'—with my cross-bow i shot the albatross. part ii the sun now rose upon the right: out of the sea came he, still hid in mist, and on the left went down into the sea. and the good south wind still blew behind, but no sweet bird did follow, nor any day for food or play came to the mariner's hollo! and i had done a hellish thing, and it would work 'em woe: for all averred, i had killed the bird that made the breeze to blow. ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay, that made the breeze to blow! nor dim nor red, like god's own head, the glorious sun uprist: then all averred, i had killed the bird that brought the fog and mist. 'twas right, said they, such birds to slay, that bring the fog and mist. the fair breeze blew, the white foam flew, the furrow followed free; we were the first that ever burst into that silent sea. down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down, 'twas sad as sad could be; and we did speak only to break the silence of the sea! all in a hot and copper sky, the bloody sun, at noon, right up above the mast did stand, no bigger than the moon. day after day, day after day, we stuck, nor breath nor motion; as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean. water, water, every where, and all the boards did shrink; water, water, every where, nor any drop to drink. the very deep did rot: o christ! that ever this should be! yea, slimy things did crawl with legs upon the slimy sea. about, about, in reel and rout the death-fires danced at night; the water, like a witch's oils, burnt green, and blue and white. and some in dreams assurèd were of the spirit that plagued us so; nine fathom deep he had followed us from the land of mist and snow. and every tongue, through utter drought, was withered at the root; we could not speak, no more than if we had been choked with soot. ah! well a-day! what evil looks had i from old and young! instead of the cross, the albatross about my neck was hung. part iii there passed a weary time. each throat was parched, and glazed each eye. a weary time! a weary time! how glazed each weary eye, when looking westward, i beheld a something in the sky. at first it seemed a little speck, and then it seemed a mist; it moved and moved, and took at last a certain shape, i wist. a speck, a mist, a shape, i wist! and still it neared and neared: as if it dodged a water-sprite, it plunged and tacked and veered. with throats unslaked, with black lips baked, we could nor laugh nor wail; through utter drought all dumb we stood! i bit my arm, i sucked the blood, and cried, a sail! a sail! with throats unslaked, with black lips baked, agape they heard me call: gramercy! they for joy did grin, and all at once their breath drew in. as they were drinking all. see! see! (i cried) she tacks no more! hither to work us weal; without a breeze, without a tide, she steadies with upright keel! the western wave was all a-flame. the day was well nigh done! almost upon the western wave rested the broad bright sun; when that strange shape drove suddenly betwixt us and the sun. and straight the sun was flecked with bars, (heaven's mother send us grace!) as if through a dungeon-grate he peered with broad and burning face. alas! (thought i, and my heart beat loud) how fast she nears and nears! are those her sails that glance in the sun, like restless gossameres? are those her ribs through which the sun did peer, as through a grate? and is that woman all her crew? is that a death? and are there two? is death that woman's mate? her lips were red, her looks were free, her locks were yellow as gold: her skin was as white as leprosy, the night-mare life-in-death was she, who thicks man's blood with cold. the naked hulk alongside came, and the twain were casting dice; 'the game is done! i've won! i've won!' quoth she, and whistles thrice. the sun's rim dips; the stars rush out; at one stride comes the dark; with far-heard whisper, o'er the sea, off shot the spectre-bark. we listened and looked sideways up! fear at my heart, as at a cup, my life-blood seemed to sip! the stars were dim, and thick the night, the steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white; from the sails the dew did drip— till clomb above the eastern bar the hornèd moon, with one bright star within the nether tip. one after one, by the star-dogged moon, too quick for groan or sigh, each turned his face with a ghastly pang, and cursed me with his eye. four times fifty living men, (and i heard nor sigh nor groan) with heavy thump, a lifeless lump, they dropped down one by one. the souls did from their bodies fly,— they fled to bliss or woe! and every soul, it passed me by, like the whizz of my cross-bow! part iv 'i fear thee, ancient mariner! i fear thy skinny hand! and thou art long, and lank, and brown, as is the ribbed sea-sand. i fear thee and thy glittering eye, and thy skinny hand, so brown.'— fear not, fear not, thou wedding-guest! this body dropt not down. alone, alone, all, all alone, alone on a wide wide sea! and never a saint took pity on my soul in agony. the many men, so beautiful! and they all dead did lie: and a thousand thousand slimy things lived on; and so did i. i looked upon the rotting sea, and drew my eyes away; i looked upon the rotting deck, and there the dead men lay. i looked to heaven, and tried to pray; but or ever a prayer had gusht, a wicked whisper came, and made my heart as dry as dust. i closed my lids, and kept them close, and the balls like pulses beat; for the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky lay dead like a load on my weary eye, and the dead were at my feet. the cold sweat melted from their limbs, nor rot nor reek did they: the look with which they looked on me had never passed away. an orphan's curse would drag to hell a spirit from on high; but oh! more horrible than that is the curse in a dead man's eye! seven days, seven nights, i saw that curse, and yet i could not die. the moving moon went up the sky, and no where did abide: softly she was going up, and a star or two beside— her beams bemocked the sultry main, like april hoar-frost spread; but where the ship's huge shadow lay, the charmèd water burnt alway a still and awful red. beyond the shadow of the ship, i watched the water-snakes: they moved in tracks of shining white, and when they reared, the elfish light fell off in hoary flakes. within the shadow of the ship i watched their rich attire: blue, glossy green, and velvet black, they coiled and swam; and every track was a flash of golden fire. o happy living things! no tongue their beauty might declare: a spring of love gushed from my heart, and i blessed them unaware: sure my kind saint took pity on me, and i blessed them unaware. the self-same moment i could pray; and from my neck so free the albatross fell off, and sank like lead into the sea. part v oh sleep! it is a gentle thing, beloved from pole to pole! to mary queen the praise be given! she sent the gentle sleep from heaven, that slid into my soul. the silly buckets on the deck, that had so long remained, i dreamt that they were filled with dew; and when i awoke, it rained. my lips were wet, my throat was cold, my garments all were dank; sure i had drunken in my dreams, and still my body drank. i moved, and could not feel my limbs: i was so light—almost i thought that i had died in sleep, and was a blessed ghost. and soon i heard a roaring wind: it did not come anear; but with its sound it shook the sails, that were so thin and sere. the upper air burst into life! and a hundred fire-flags sheen, to and fro they were hurried about! and to and fro, and in and out, the wan stars danced between. and the coming wind did roar more loud, and the sails did sigh like sedge, and the rain poured down from one black cloud; the moon was at its edge. the thick black cloud was cleft, and still the moon was at its side: like waters shot from some high crag, the lightning fell with never a jag, a river steep and wide. the loud wind never reached the ship, yet now the ship moved on! beneath the lightning and the moon the dead men gave a groan. they groaned, they stirred, they all uprose, nor spake, nor moved their eyes; it had been strange, even in a dream, to have seen those dead men rise. the helmsman steered, the ship moved on; yet never a breeze up-blew; the mariners all 'gan work the ropes, where they were wont to do; they raised their limbs like lifeless tools— we were a ghastly crew. the body of my brother's son stood by me, knee to knee: the body and i pulled at one rope, but he said nought to me. 'i fear thee, ancient mariner!' be calm, thou wedding-guest! 'twas not those souls that fled in pain, which to their corses came again, but a troop of spirits blest: for when it dawned—they dropped their arms, and clustered round the mast; sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths, and from their bodies passed. around, around, flew each sweet sound, then darted to the sun; slowly the sounds came back again, now mixed, now one by one. sometimes a-dropping from the sky i heard the sky-lark sing; sometimes all little birds that are, how they seemed to fill the sea and air with their sweet jargoning! and now 'twas like all instruments, now like a lonely flute; and now it is an angel's song, that makes the heavens be mute. it ceased; yet still the sails made on a pleasant noise till noon, a noise like of a hidden brook in the leafy month of june, that to the sleeping woods all night singeth a quiet tune. till noon we quietly sailed on, yet never a breeze did breathe: slowly and smoothly went the ship, moved onward from beneath. under the keel nine fathom deep, from the land of mist and snow, the spirit slid: and it was he that made the ship to go. the sails at noon left off their tune, and the ship stood still also. the sun, right up above the mast, had fixed her to the ocean: but in a minute she 'gan stir, with a short uneasy motion— backwards and forwards half her length with a short uneasy motion. then like a pawing horse let go, she made a sudden bound: it flung the blood into my head, and i fell down in a swound. how long in that same fit i lay, i have not to declare; but ere my living life returned, i heard and in my soul discerned two voices in the air.

class <line> <line>consciousness among people who work behind registers. <line> <line>and it’s interesting, there’s all kinds of different races <line> <line>and classes and income levels represented in the world <line> <line>of cashiers, but at the level of values we see predominantly <line> <line>two classes, the complacent and the entitled, though many <line> <line>cashiers are some measure of both. the complacent <line> <line>are resigned to what they understand to be their position. <line> <line>they’re courteous and reliable; class issues only arise <line> <line>when people are rude to them, which they tend to handle fine, <line> <line>though if they say anything about it afterwards, it tends to be <line> <line>a cruel and brief dismissal not only of the occurrence, <line> <line>but of the entire offending person. the entitled <line> <line>have a very complicated expression of social hierarchy. <line> <line>because they see themselves in transition, <line> <line>usually ascending, there’s this idea that their values won’t, <line> <line>or can’t, find full expression from their current position <line> <line>and so they don’t feel compelled to act in a way consistent <line> <line>with their values, while at the same time they may expect <line> <line>to be treated in accordance with those values. when people <line> <line>are rude to them, they flip out. basically

<line> <line>very cold. hard frosts. the river falling. <line> <line>for several days we pass deserted <line> <line>mandan villages along both banks. <line> <line>the beaver and otter are becoming more <line> <line>abundant. we put ashore at noon, <line> <line>setting fire to the prairies to signal <line> <line>that we wish council with the natives. <line> <line>these arikara much reduced by pox. <line> <line>it is customary for their nation <line> <line>to show its grief by pain, some cutting off <line> <line>two smaller fingers at the second joint. <line> <line>the earth of the plains is in many places <line> <line>opened in long crevices, its soil <line> <line>indifferent and with a kind of timothy <line> <line>branching like flax from its main stalk. <line> <line>delayed here today so as to take <line> <line>equal altitudes, the weights of the <line> <line>waters of the two rivers, their specific <line> <line>gravities. as we near the great platte, <line> <line>the sandbars are more numerous, sawyers <line> <line>worse than they were below. mulberry, <line> <line>oak and walnut. these prairies from the river <line> <line>have very much the appearance of farms. <line> <line>we continue to pole our way upstream. <line> <line>nothwithstanding our precautions, we <line> <line>struck a bar and were near turning over. <line> <line>the sergeants are directed each to keep <line> <line>a journal of all passing occurrences <line> <line>and such other descriptions of the country <line> <line>as shall seem to them worthy of notice. <line> <line>our hunters report deer in every copse. <line> <line>i got out and walked for one mile through a <line> <line>rush bottom, nettles as high as my breast. <line> <line>all the forepart of the day we were <line> <line>arranging our company and taking on <line> <line>those articles we will need. st. charles. <line> <line>the men spent their last night agreeably, <line> <line>dancing with the french ladies, &c. <line> <line>my ride was on a road finely shaded, <line> <line>with now and then a good farm. the corn <line> <line>in tassel, its leaves of a deep rich green <line> <line>bending at the ends by their own weight. <line> <line>wheat and oat stubble. a hilly country. <line> <line>i passed a toll-gate, and, looking back, <line> <line>had my last view of the town’s steeples. <line> <line>from the state house cupola i could count <line> <line>the buildings, the number of which was <line> <line>ninety. a wooden bridge crosses the river <line> <line>just below the town. men were engaged in <line> <line>racing their horses. i sought lodging <line> <line>and was shown to bed in a large barrack <line> <line>where a man and wife conversed with me <line> <line>until i feigned sleep. this is a post town, <line> <line>the mails arriving from both east and west <line> <line>on wednesdays and saturdays. a young woman <line> <line>gave me directions from an upstairs window. <line> <line>i descended the hill into frankfort. <line> <line>there has lately been established a large <line> <line>manufactory for spinning hemp and flax. <line> <line>it is wrought by water and keeps in motion <line> <line>1200 spindles. the streets of lexington <line> <line>cross at right angles, its stores filled both <line> <line>with imports and with local goods: fine <line> <line>cutlery, tin ware, muslins and nankeens. <line> <line>i was so well put up that a man would be <line> <line>fastidious to a fault to have found <line> <line>the least thing wanting. approaching the city <line> <line>the land changed steadily for the better, <line> <line>no longer broken, as to the eastward, <line> <line>but fine extensive levels and slopes, <line> <line>the road very wide, with grazing parks, <line> <line>meadows, and every spot cultivated. <line> <line>the farms hereabout have generally <line> <line>good and spacious stone barns, a few acres <line> <line>cleared but for those stumps or girdled trees <line> <line>still standing. the neighbors found last year <line> <line>a human jawbone, rough and honeycombed. <line> <line>my wagoner arrived this afternoon <line> <line>and went on, appointing to be in <line> <line>louisville before me. i pass a house <line> <line>with small turrets at its corners, lawns, <line> <line>the whole needing only vineyards for the look <line> <line>of villas in provence and languedoc. <line> <line>noticed along the banks of the holston <line> <line>phlox with white flowers and phlox with pink flowers, <line> <line>two different species, very small <line> <line>phlox with lance-shaped leaves. where i <line> <line>come in from abingdon, the kentucky road <line> <line>divides, the other fork for burke courthouse. <line> <line>with nothing to do i make ink from gall nuts. <line> <line>more opossum taken in the woods. <line> <line>this animal’s greatest peculiarity <line> <line>is the false belly of the female. <line> <line>she can draw the slit so close that one must look <line> <line>narrowly to find it if she be virgin. <line> <line>the air clearing this morning, i was <line> <line>surprised with a full prospect of mountains. <line> <line>this river where we leave off is 240 miles <line> <line>distant in a straight line from currituck <line> <line>inlet. the turkey-cocks begin to gobble, <line> <line>which is the language wherein they make love. <line> <line>we have a dreamer of dreams among us <line> <line>who warned me in the morning to take care <line> <line>that i not fall into the creek. <line> <line>i thanked him and used what caution i could, <line> <line>but my horse made a false leap and laid me <line> <line>down in the water at my full length. <line> <line>the sky at sunset had a swept look. <line> <line>there was risk of our dining with st. anthony <line> <line>when one indian knocked down a fat bear. <line> <line>of the stem of the silk-grass their women make <line> <line>small aprons which they wear for decency. <line> <line>they put these on with so much art <line> <line>that their most negligent postures reveal <line> <line>nothing to our curiosity. <line> <line>the ruffles of some of our fellows <line> <line>were a little discolored by the bloodroot <line> <line>which these ladies use to improve their charms. <line> <line>bear, it would seem, is no diet for saints, <line> <line>for it is apt to make them too rampant. <line> <line>at night, the surveyors took advantage <line> <line>of a clear sky. this trial of our variance <line> <line>shows it still something less then 3 degrees, <line> <line>so it remains much as we had found it <line> <line>at the sea. we have now run the poles <line> <line>beyond those inhabitants most inland. <line> <line>there fell a sort of scots mist all the way. <line> <line>i have learned how rattlesnakes take a squirrel. <line> <line>they ogle the poor beast till by force of charm <line> <line>it falls down stupefied and senseless. <line> <line>the snake approaches it and moistens first <line> <line>one ear and then the other with his spittle, <line> <line>making the head all slippery. when that is done <line> <line>he draws this member into his mouth, <line> <line>and after it, by casual degrees, <line> <line>all the rest of the body. i am not so <line> <line>rigid an observer of the sabbath <line> <line>as to allow of no journeys to be <line> <line>taken upon it. nor would i care, <line> <line>like a certain new england magistrate, <line> <line>to order a man to the whipping post <line> <line>for daring to ride for a midwife on the <line> <line>lord’s day. and yet we found plainly <line> <line>that travelling on the sunday had not <line> <line>thriven with us in the least. the rain <line> <line>was enlivened with loud thunder, and there is <line> <line>something in the woods that makes this sound <line> <line>more awful, the violence of the lightning <line> <line>more visible as the trees are shivered <line> <line>quite to the root. this great dismal swamp <line> <line>is the source of five several rivers. <line> <line>we run our line to its skirts, which begin with <line> <line>dwarf reeds, moist uneven ground. the season <line> <line>inclining us to aguish distempers, <line> <line>we were suffered by the resident to <line> <line>cut up wood for firing, drive away the damps. <line> <line>at the bottom of the account mankind <line> <line>are great losers by the luxuries <line> <line>of feather beds and warm apartments. <line> <line>we perceive our appetites to mend, <line> <line>and though we have to drink only what <line> <line>adam had in paradise, that stream of life <line> <line>runs cool and peaceably in our veins. <line> <line>the days are hard. our slumbers sweeten, and <line> <line>if ever we dream of women they are kind. <line> <line>i delight to see the banks of the inlet <line> <line>adorned with myrtle, yet it must be owned <line> <line>that, sacred to venus though it be, this plant <line> <line>grows commonly in very dirty soil. <line> <line>norfolk has most the air of a town <line> <line>of any in virginia. there are now <line> <line>riding at her wharves near 20 brigantines. <line> <line>the trade hither is engrossed by those <line> <line>saints of new england who every week <line> <line>carry off a pretty deal of tobacco. <line> <line>i have found that after my devotions <line> <line>a walk in the garden can do much <line> <line>to fill my heart with clear obedience. <line> <line>i repair me there that i might think <line> <line>deeply of the earth and how it will be <line> <line>all too soon my sleeping-place. for i am told <line> <line>to fear such things as bring me to ill terms, <line> <line>told of those who seek congress with the earth <line> <line>that they shall have her in their time forever. <line> <line>that her places sing their love-songs for no man. <line> <line>that i am not the suitor whose betrothed <line> <line>awaits him, but some unwelcome third <line> <line>with god alone her lover. and yet i would <line> <line>look upon such country as will show me <line> <line>nature undressed, the strata of the land, <line> <line>her lays and beds and all her privacies. <line> <line>for my wonder tells me i should be <line> <line>promiscuous, should learn by all the <line> <line>laws of bodies and by where they are <line> <line>the joyful news out of the new found world. <line> <line>this walk is news. its bodies point me always <line> <line>in and out along some newer course. <line> <line>there have been divers days together <line> <line>wherein alone i’ve watched these flowers <line> <line>buoyed on their stems and holding up the sun. <line> <line>just now i catch them thinking on themselves, <line> <line>composing from their dark places the least <line> <line>passages for light, tendering how they look <line> <line>and how i look on them. it comes to me <line> <line>that the world is to the end of it <line> <line>thinking on itself and how its parts <line> <line>gather with one another for their time. <line> <line>these are the light, and all the forms they show <line> <line>are lords of inns wherein the soul takes rest. <line> <line>if i could find it in myself to hide <line> <line>the world within the world then there would be <line> <line>no place to which i could remove it, save <line> <line>that brightness wherein all things come to see. <line>","activities,travels & journeys,nature,animals,landscapes & pastorals,seas, rivers, & streams,stars, planets, heavens,trees & flowers,arts &
