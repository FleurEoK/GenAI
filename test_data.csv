<line> <line>he lets go of the neighbors’ boy’s hand warming his own. <line> <line>he refuses the warm porridge forever, renounces <line> <line>his mother’s embrace. it only lasted a month, <line> <line>this partial answer, because even then everyone knew <line> <line>that the sweet fruit they grew housed the bitterest seeds, <line> <line>that piety is its own reward while belief only darkens <line> <line>and deepens like the sea before them, a place <line> <line>meant for those seeking life other than on this dry earth. <line> <line>that’s why prophets were welcomed here, calmly, <line> <line>because god was like rain and they like the saplings <line> <line>which know only the first verse to the sky’s rainless hymn. <line> <line>and that’s why africa’s tallest minaret looms unfinished, <line> <line>visible from the next town over, and for fifty leagues from the sea if <line> <line>it were turned into a lighthouse for the ships that no longer come. <line> <line>the merchant who’d built it, money made from smuggling <line> <line>subsidized goods to carthage and used renaults from rotterdam, <line> <line>ran out of money, could not afford the mosque that was to stand <line> <line>next to it, leaving its gray concrete bleaching in the sun. <line> <line>there’s enough history here to enable anyone to finish the thought. <line> <line>it’s useless then to track the fate of these travelers, <line> <line>some, without life jackets, had never learned how to swim. <line> <line>why not let them live in text as they do in life?—they’ve lived <line> <line>without words for so long—why not release them <line> <line>from the pen’s anchor and let them drift to their completion?

9102,6933,"<line> <line>1 sometime now past in the autumnal tide, when phoebus wanted but one hour to bed, the trees all richly clad, yet void of pride, were gilded o’re by his rich golden head. their leaves and fruits seem’d painted but was true of green, of red, of yellow, mixed hew, rapt were my senses at this delectable view. 2 i wist not what to wish, yet sure thought i, if so much excellence abide below, how excellent is he that dwells on high? whose power and beauty by his works we know. sure he is goodness, wisdom, glory, light, that hath this under world so richly dight. more heaven than earth was here, no winter and no night. 3 then on a stately oak i cast mine eye, whose ruffling top the clouds seem’d to aspire; how long since thou wast in thine infancy? thy strength and stature, more thy years admire, hath hundred winters past since thou wast born? or thousand since thou brakest thy shell of horn, if so, all these as nought, eternity doth scorn. 4 then higher on the glistering sun i gaz’d, whose beams was shaded by the leafy tree. the more i look’d, the more i grew amaz’d and softly said, what glory’s like to thee? soul of this world, this universe’s eye, no wonder some made thee a deity: had i not better known (alas) the same had i. 5 thou as a bridegroom from thy chamber rushes and as a strong man joys to run a race. the morn doth usher thee with smiles and blushes. the earth reflects her glances in thy face. birds, insects, animals with vegative, thy heat from death and dullness doth revive: and in the darksome womb of fruitful nature dive. 6 thy swift annual and diurnal course, thy daily straight and yearly oblique path, thy pleasing fervour, and thy scorching force, all mortals here the feeling knowledge hath. thy presence makes it day, thy absence night, quaternal seasons caused by thy might: hail creature, full of sweetness, beauty, and delight. 7 art thou so full of glory that no eye hath strength thy shining rays once to behold? and is thy splendid throne erect so high? as, to approach it, can no earthly mould. how full of glory then must thy creator be? who gave this bright light luster unto thee: admir’d, ador’d for ever be that majesty. 8 silent alone where none or saw, or heard, in pathless paths i lead my wand’ring feet. my humble eyes to lofty skies i rear’d to sing some song my mazed muse thought meet. my great creator i would magnifie, that nature had thus decked liberally: but ah and ah again, my imbecility! 9 i heard the merry grasshopper then sing, the black clad cricket bear a second part. they kept one tune and played on the same string, seeming to glory in their little art. shall creatures abject thus their voices raise? and in their kind resound their maker’s praise: whilst i, as mute, can warble forth no higher layes. 10 when present times look back to ages past and men in being fancy those are dead, it makes things gone perpetually to last and calls back months and years that long since fled it makes a man more aged in conceit, than was methuselah or’s grand-sire great: while of their persons and their acts his mind doth treat. 11 sometimes in eden fair he seems to be, see glorious adam there made lord of all, fancies the apple, dangle on the tree, that turn’d his sovereign to a naked thrall, who like a miscreant’s driven from that place to get his bread with pain and sweat of face: a penalty impos’d on his backsliding race. 12 here sits our grandame in retired place, and in her lap her bloody cain new born, the weeping imp oft looks her in the face, bewails his unknown hap and fate forlorn; his mother sighs to think of paradise, and how she lost her bliss, to be more wise, believing him that was, and is, father of lyes. 13 here cain and abel come to sacrifice, fruits of the earth and fatlings each do bring, on abels gift the fire descends from skies, but no such sign on false cain’s offering; with sullen hateful looks he goes his wayes. hath thousand thoughts to end his brothers dayes, upon whose blood his future good he hopes to raise. 14 there abel keeps his sheep, no ill he thinks, his brother comes, then acts his fratricide. the virgin earth of blood her first draught drinks, but since that time she often hath been cloy’d; the wretch with ghastly face and dreadful mind, thinks each he sees will serve him in his kind, though none on earth but kindred near then could he find. 15 who fancies not his looks now at the barr, his face like death, his heart with horror fraught, nor male-factor ever felt like warr, when deep despair with wish of life hath fought, branded with guilt, and crusht with treble woes, a vagabond to land of nod he goes. a city builds, that wals might him secure from foes. 16 who thinks not oft upon the fathers ages. their long descent, how nephews sons they saw, the starry observations of those sages, and how their precepts to their sons were law, how adam sigh’d to see his progeny, cloath’d all in his black, sinful livery, who neither guilt not yet the punishment could fly. 17 our life compare we with their length of dayes who to the tenth of theirs doth now arrive? and though thus short, we shorten many wayes, living so little while we are alive; in eating, drinking, sleeping, vain delight so unawares comes on perpetual night, and puts all pleasures vain unto eternal flight. 18 when i behold the heavens as in their prime, and then the earth (though old) still clad in green, the stones and trees, insensible of time, nor age nor wrinkle on their front are seen; if winter come, and greenness then do fade, a spring returns, and they more youthfull made; but man grows old, lies down, remains where once he’s laid. 19 by birth more noble than those creatures all, yet seems by nature and by custom curs’d, no sooner born, but grief and care makes fall that state obliterate he had at first: nor youth, nor strength, nor wisdom spring again nor habitations long their names retain, but in oblivion to the final day remain. 20 shall i then praise the heavens, the trees, the earth because their beauty and their strength last longer shall i wish there, or never to had birth, because they’re bigger and their bodyes stronger? nay, they shall darken, perish, fade and dye, and when unmade, so ever shall they lye, but man was made for endless immortality. 21 under the cooling shadow of a stately elm close sate i by a goodly rivers side, where gliding streams the rocks did overwhelm; a lonely place, with pleasures dignifi’d. i once that lov’d the shady woods so well, now thought the rivers did the trees excel, and if the sun would ever shine, there would i dwell. 22 while on the stealing stream i fixt mine eye, which to the long’d-for ocean held its course, i markt, nor crooks, nor rubs that there did lye could hinder ought but still augment its force: o happy flood, quoth i, that holds thy race till thou arrive at thy beloved place, nor is it rocks or shoals that can obstruct thy pace. 23 nor is’t enough that thou alone may’st slide, but hundred brooks in thy cleer waves do meet, so hand in hand along with thee they glide to thetis house, where all imbrace and greet: thou emblem true of what i count the best, o could i lead my rivolets to rest, so may we press to that vast mansion, ever blest. 24 ye fish which in this liquid region ’bide that for each season have your habitation, now salt, now fresh where you think best to glide to unknown coasts to give a visitation, in lakes and ponds, you leave your numerous fry, so nature taught, and yet you know not why, you watry folk that know not your felicity. 25 look how the wantons frisk to tast the air, then to the colder bottome streight they dive, eftsoon to neptun’s glassy hall repair to see what trade they, great ones, there do drive, who forrage o’re the spacious sea-green field, and take the trembling prey before it yield, whose armour is their scales, their spreading fins their shield. 26 while musing thus with contemplation fed, and thousand fancies buzzing in my brain, the sweet-tongu’d philomel percht ore my head, and chanted forth a most melodious strain which rapt me so with wonder and delight, i judg’d my hearing better than my sight, and wisht me wings with her a while to take my flight. 27 o merry bird (said i) that fears no snares, that neither toyles nor hoards up in thy barn, feels no sad thoughts, nor cruciating cares to gain more good, or shun what might thee harm thy clothes ne’re wear, thy meat is every where, thy bed a bough, thy drink the water cleer, reminds not what is past, nor whats to come dost fear. 28 the dawning morn with songs thou dost prevent, sets hundred notes unto thy feathered crew, so each one tunes his pretty instrument, and warbling out the old, begin anew, and thus they pass their youth in summer season, then follow thee into a better region, where winter’s never felt by that sweet airy legion. 29 man at the best a creature frail and vain, in knowledge ignorant, in strength but weak, subject to sorrows, losses, sickness, pain, each storm his state, his mind, his body break, from some of these he never finds cessation, but day or night, within, without, vexation, troubles from foes, from friends, from dearest, near’st relation. 30 and yet this sinfull creature, frail and vain, this lump of wretchedness, of sin and sorrow, this weather-beaten vessel wrackt with pain, joys not in hope of an eternal morrow; nor all his losses, crosses and vexation, in weight, in frequency and long duration can make him deeply groan for that divine translation. 31 the mariner that on smooth waves doth glide, sings merrily and steers his barque with ease, as if he had command of wind and tide, and now becomes great master of the seas; but suddenly a storm spoils all the sport, and makes him long for a more quiet port, which ’gainst all adverse winds may serve for fort. 32 so he that faileth in this world of pleasure, feeding on sweets, that never bit of th’ sowre, that’s full of friends, of honour and of treasure, fond fool, he takes this earth ev’n for heav’ns bower, but sad affliction comes and makes him see here’s neither honour, wealth, nor safety; only above is found all with security. 33 o time the fatal wrack of mortal things, that draws oblivions curtains over kings, their sumptuous monuments, men know them not, their names without a record are forgot, their parts, their ports, their pomp’s all laid in th’ dust. nor wit, nor gold, nor buildings scape times rust; but he whose name is grav’d in the white stone shall last and shine when all of these are gone. <line>","living,death,growing old,time & brevity,nature,fall,trees & flowers,arts & sciences,philosophy"

not in vain, <line>even for its own sake, do we purchase pain. <line> <line> perhaps the workings of defiance stir <line> <line> within me—or perhaps a cold despair, <line> <line> brought on when ills habitually recur, <line> <line> perhaps a kinder clime, or purer air <line> <line> (for even to this may change of soul refer, <line> <line> and with light armour we may learn to bear), <line> <line> have taught me a strange quiet, which was not <line>the chief companion of a calmer lot. <line> <line> i feel almost at times as i have felt <line> <line> in happy childhood; trees, and flowers, and brooks, <line> <line> which do remember me of where i dwelt <line> <line> ere my young mind was sacrific'd to books, <line> <line> come as of yore upon me, and can melt <line> <line> my heart with recognition of their looks; <line> <line> and even at moments i could think i see <line>some living thing to love—but none like thee. <line> <line> here are the alpine landscapes which create <line> <line> a fund for contemplation; to admire <line> <line> is a brief feeling of a trivial date; <line> <line> but something worthier do such scenes inspire: <line> <line> here to be lonely is not desolate, <line> <line> for much i view which i could most desire, <line> <line> and, above all, a lake i can behold <line>lovelier, not dearer, than our own of old. <line> <line> oh that thou wert but with me!—but i grow <line> <line> the fool of my own wishes, and forget <line> <line> the solitude which i have vaunted so <line> <line> has lost its praise in this but one regret; <line> <line> there may be others which i less may show; <line> <line> i am not of the plaintive mood, and yet <line> <line> i feel an ebb in my philosophy, <line>and the tide rising in my alter'd eye. <line> <line> i did remind thee of our own dear lake, <line> <line> by the old hall which may be mine no more. <line> <line> leman's is fair; but think not i forsake <line> <line> the sweet remembrance of a dearer shore: <line> <line> sad havoc time must with my memory make <line> <line> ere that or thou can fade these eyes before; <line> <line> though, like all things which i have lov'd, they are <line>resign'd for ever, or divided far. <line> <line> the world is all before me; i but ask <line> <line> of nature that with which she will comply— <line> <line> it is but in her summer's sun to bask, <line> <line> to mingle with the quiet of her sky, <line> <line> to see her gentle face without a mask, <line> <line> and never gaze on it with apathy. <line> <line> she was my early friend, and now shall be <line>my sister—till i look again on thee. <line> <line> i can reduce all feelings but this one; <line> <line> and that i would not; for at length i see <line> <line> such scenes as those wherein my life begun, <line> <line> the earliest—even the only paths for me— <line> <line> had i but sooner learnt the crowd to shun, <line> <line> i had been better than i now can be; <line> <line> the passions which have torn me would have slept; <line>i had not suffer'd, and thou hadst not wept. <line> <line> with false ambition what had i to do? <line> <line> little with love, and least of all with fame; <line> <line> and yet they came unsought, and with me grew, <line> <line> and made me all which they can make—a name, <line> <line> yet this was not the end i did pursue; <line> <line> surely i once beheld a nobler aim. <line> <line> but all is over—i am one the more <line>to baffled millions which have gone before. <line> <line> and for the future, this world's future may <line> <line> from me demand but little of my care; <line> <line> i have outliv'd myself by many a day, <line> <line> having surviv'd so many things that were; <line> <line> my years have been no slumber, but the prey <line> <line> of ceaseless vigils; for i had the share <line> <line> of life which might have fill'd a century, <line> <line> before its fourth in time had pass'd me by. <line> <line> and for the remnant which may be to come <line> <line> i am content; and for the past i feel <line> <line> not thankless, for within the crowded sum <line> <line> of struggles, happiness at times would steal, <line> <line> and for the present, i would not benumb <line> <line> my feelings further. nor shall i conceal <line> <line> that with all this i still can look around, <line>and worship nature with a thought profound. <line> <line> for thee, my own sweet sister, in thy heart <line> <line> i know myself secure, as thou in mine; <line> <line> we were and are—i am, even as thou art— <line> <line> beings who ne'er each other can resign; <line> <line> it is the same, together or apart, <line> <line> from life's commencement to its slow decline <line> <line> we are entwin'd—let death come slow or fast, <line>the tie which bound the first endures the last! <line> <line>","living,love,romantic love,relationships,family & ancestors,nature"

(said christabel) and who art thou? the lady strange made answer meet, and her voice was faint and sweet:— have pity on my sore distress, i scarce can speak for weariness: stretch forth thy hand, and have no fear! said christabel, how camest thou here? and the lady, whose voice was faint and sweet, did thus pursue her answer meet:— my sire is of a noble line, and my name is geraldine: five warriors seized me yestermorn, me, even me, a maid forlorn: they choked my cries with force and fright, and tied me on a palfrey white. the palfrey was as fleet as wind, and they rode furiously behind. they spurred amain, their steeds were white: and once we crossed the shade of night. as sure as heaven shall rescue me, i have no thought what men they be; nor do i know how long it is (for i have lain entranced i wis) since one, the tallest of the five, took me from the palfrey's back, a weary woman, scarce alive. some muttered words his comrades spoke: he placed me underneath this oak; he swore they would return with haste; whither they went i cannot tell— i thought i heard, some minutes past, sounds as of a castle bell. stretch forth thy hand (thus ended she). and help a wretched maid to flee. then christabel stretched forth her hand, and comforted fair geraldine: o well, bright dame! may you command the service of sir leoline; and gladly our stout chivalry will he send forth and friends withal to guide and guard you safe and free home to your noble father's hall. she rose: and forth with steps they passed that strove to be, and were not, fast. her gracious stars the lady blest, and thus spake on sweet christabel: all our household are at rest, the hall as silent as the cell; sir leoline is weak in health, and may not well awakened be, but we will move as if in stealth, and i beseech your courtesy, this night, to share your couch with me. they crossed the moat, and christabel took the key that fitted well; a little door she opened straight, all in the middle of the gate; the gate that was ironed within and without, where an army in battle array had marched out. the lady sank, belike through pain, and christabel with might and main lifted her up, a weary weight, over the threshold of the gate: then the lady rose again, and moved, as she were not in pain. so free from danger, free from fear, they crossed the court: right glad they were. and christabel devoutly cried to the lady by her side, praise we the virgin all divine who hath rescued thee from thy distress! alas, alas! said geraldine, i cannot speak for weariness. so free from danger, free from fear, they crossed the court: right glad they were. outside her kennel, the mastiff old lay fast asleep, in moonshine cold. the mastiff old did not awake, yet she an angry moan did make! and what can ail the mastiff bitch? never till now she uttered yell beneath the eye of christabel. perhaps it is the owlet's scritch: for what can ail the mastiff bitch? they passed the hall, that echoes still, pass as lightly as you will! the brands were flat, the brands were dying, amid their own white ashes lying; but when the lady passed, there came a tongue of light, a fit of flame; and christabel saw the lady's eye, and nothing else saw she thereby, save the boss of the shield of sir leoline tall, which hung in a murky old niche in the wall. o softly tread, said christabel, my father seldom sleepeth well. sweet christabel her feet doth bare, and jealous of the listening air they steal their way from stair to stair, now in glimmer, and now in gloom, and now they pass the baron's room, as still as death, with stifled breath! and now have reached her chamber door; and now doth geraldine press down the rushes of the chamber floor. the moon shines dim in the open air, and not a moonbeam enters here. but they without its light can see the chamber carved so curiously, carved with figures strange and sweet, all made out of the carver's brain, for a lady's chamber meet: the lamp with twofold silver chain is fastened to an angel's feet. the silver lamp burns dead and dim; but christabel the lamp will trim. she trimmed the lamp, and made it bright, and left it swinging to and fro, while geraldine, in wretched plight, sank down upon the floor below. o weary lady, geraldine, i pray you, drink this cordial wine! it is a wine of virtuous powers; my mother made it of wild flowers. and will your mother pity me, who am a maiden most forlorn? christabel answered—woe is me! she died the hour that i was born. i have heard the grey-haired friar tell how on her death-bed she did say, that she should hear the castle-bell strike twelve upon my wedding-day. o mother dear! that thou wert here! i would, said geraldine, she were! but soon with altered voice, said she— 'off, wandering mother! peak and pine! i have power to bid thee flee.' alas! what ails poor geraldine? why stares she with unsettled eye? can she the bodiless dead espy? and why with hollow voice cries she, 'off, woman, off! this hour is mine— though thou her guardian spirit be, off, woman, off! 'tis given to me.' then christabel knelt by the lady's side, and raised to heaven her eyes so blue— alas! said she, this ghastly ride— dear lady! it hath wildered you! the lady wiped her moist cold brow, and faintly said, ' 'tis over now!' again the wild-flower wine she drank: her fair large eyes 'gan glitter bright, and from the floor whereon she sank, the lofty lady stood upright: she was most beautiful to see, like a lady of a far countrèe. and thus the lofty lady spake— 'all they who live in the upper sky, do love you, holy christabel! and you love them, and for their sake and for the good which me befel, even i in my degree will try, fair maiden, to requite you well. but now unrobe yourself; for i must pray, ere yet in bed i lie.' quoth christabel, so let it be! and as the lady bade, did she. her gentle limbs did she undress, and lay down in her loveliness. but through her brain of weal and woe so many thoughts moved to and fro, that vain it were her lids to close; so half-way from the bed she rose, and on her elbow did recline to look at the lady geraldine. beneath the lamp the lady bowed, and slowly rolled her eyes around; then drawing in her breath aloud, like one that shuddered, she unbound the cincture from beneath her breast: her silken robe, and inner vest, dropt to her feet, and full in view, behold! her bosom and half her side— a sight to dream of, not to tell! o shield her! shield sweet christabel! yet geraldine nor speaks nor stirs; ah! what a stricken look was hers! deep from within she seems half-way to lift some weight with sick assay, and eyes the maid and seeks delay; then suddenly, as one defied, collects herself in scorn and pride, and lay down by the maiden's side!— and in her arms the maid she took, ah wel-a-day! and with low voice and doleful look these words did say: 'in the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell, which is lord of thy utterance, christabel! thou knowest to-night, and wilt know to-morrow, this mark of my shame, this seal of my sorrow; but vainly thou warrest, for this is alone in thy power to declare, that in the dim forest thou heard'st a low moaning, and found'st a bright lady, surpassingly fair; and didst bring her home with thee in love and in charity, to shield her and shelter her from the damp air.' the conclusion to part i it was a lovely sight to see the lady christabel, when she was praying at the old oak tree. amid the jaggèd shadows of mossy leafless boughs, kneeling in the moonlight, to make her gentle vows; her slender palms together prest, heaving sometimes on her breast; her face resigned to bliss or bale— her face, oh call it fair not pale, and both blue eyes more bright than clear, each about to have a tear. with open eyes (ah woe is me!) asleep, and dreaming fearfully, fearfully dreaming, yet, i wis, dreaming that alone, which is— o sorrow and shame! can this be she, the lady, who knelt at the old oak tree? and lo! the worker of these harms, that holds the maiden in her arms, seems to slumber still and mild, as a mother with her child. a star hath set, a star hath risen, o geraldine! since arms of thine have been the lovely lady's prison. o geraldine! one hour was thine— thou'st had thy will! by tairn and rill, the night-birds all that hour were still. but now they are jubilant anew, from cliffand tower, tu—whoo! tu—whoo! tu—whoo! tu—whoo! from wood and fell! and see! the lady christabel gathers herself from out her trance; her limbs relax, her countenance grows sad and soft; the smooth thin lids close o'er her eyes; and tears she sheds— large tears that leave the lashes bright! and oft the while she seems to smile as infants at a sudden light! yea, she doth smile, and she doth weep, like a youthful hermitess, beauteous in a wilderness, who, praying always, prays in sleep. and, if she move unquietly, perchance, 'tis but the blood so free comes back and tingles in her feet. no doubt, she hath a vision sweet. what if her guardian spirit 'twere, what if she knew her mother near? but this she knows, in joys and woes, that saints will aid if men will call: for the blue sky bends over all! part ii each matin bell, the baron saith, knells us back to a world of death. these words sir leoline first said, when he rose and found his lady dead: these words sir leoline will say many a morn to his dying day! and hence the custom and law began that still at dawn the sacristan, who duly pulls the heavy bell, five and forty beads must tell between each stroke—a warning knell, which not a soul can choose but hear from bratha head to wyndermere. saith bracy the bard, so let it knell! and let the drowsy sacristan still count as slowly as he can! there is no lack of such, i ween, as well fill up the space between. in langdale pike and witch's lair, and dungeon-ghyll so foully rent, with ropes of rock and bells of air three sinful sextons' ghosts are pent, who all give back, one after t'other, the death-note to their living brother; and oft too, by the knell offended, just as their one! two! three! is ended, the devil mocks the doleful tale with a merry peal from borodale. the air is still! through mist and cloud that merry peal comes ringing loud; and geraldine shakes off her dread, and rises lightly from the bed; puts on her silken vestments white, and tricks her hair in lovely plight, and nothing doubting of her spell awakens the lady christabel. 'sleep you, sweet lady christabel? i trust that you have rested well.' and christabel awoke and spied the same who lay down by her side— o rather say, the same whom she raised up beneath the old oak tree! nay, fairer yet! and yet more fair! for she belike hath drunken deep of all the blessedness of sleep! and while she spake, her looks, her air such gentle thankfulness declare, that (so it seemed) her girded vests grew tight beneath her heaving breasts. 'sure i have sinn'd!' said christabel, 'now heaven be praised if all be well!' and in low faltering tones, yet sweet, did she the lofty lady greet with such perplexity of mind as dreams too lively leave behind. so quickly she rose, and quickly arrayed her maiden limbs, and having prayed that he, who on the cross did groan, might wash away her sins unknown, she forthwith led fair geraldine to meet her sire, sir leoline. the lovely maid and the lady tall are pacing both into the hall, and pacing on through page and groom, enter the baron's presence-room. the baron rose, and while he prest his gentle daughter to his breast, with cheerful wonder in his eyes the lady geraldine espies, and gave such welcome to the same, as might beseem so bright a dame! but when he heard the lady's tale, and when she told her father's name, why waxed sir leoline so pale, murmuring o'er the name again, lord roland de vaux of tryermaine? alas! they had been friends in youth; but whispering tongues can poison truth; and constancy lives in realms above; and life is thorny; and youth is vain; and to be wroth with one we love doth work like madness in the brain. and thus it chanced, as i divine, with roland and sir leoline. each spake words of high disdain and insult to his heart's best brother: they parted—ne'er to meet again! but never either found another to free the hollow heart from paining— they stood aloof, the scars remaining, like cliffs which had been rent asunder; a dreary sea now flows between;— but neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder, shall wholly do away, i ween, the marks of that which once hath been. sir leoline, a moment's space, stood gazing on the damsel's face: and the youthful lord of tryermaine came back upon his heart again. o then the baron forgot his age, his noble heart swelled high with rage; he swore by the wounds in jesu's side he would proclaim it far and wide, with trump and solemn heraldry, that they, who thus had wronged the dame, were base as spotted infamy! 'and if they dare deny the same, my herald shall appoint a week, and let the recreant traitors seek my tourney court—that there and then i may dislodge their reptile souls from the bodies and forms of men!' he spake: his eye in lightning rolls! for the lady was ruthlessly seized; and he kenned in the beautiful lady the child of his friend! and now the tears were on his face, and fondly in his arms he took fair geraldine, who met the embrace, prolonging it with joyous look. which when she viewed, a vision fell upon the soul of christabel, the vision of fear, the touch and pain! she shrunk and shuddered, and saw again— (ah, woe is me! was it for thee, thou gentle maid! such sights to see?) again she saw that bosom old, again she felt that bosom cold, and drew in her breath with a hissing sound: whereat the knight turned wildly round, and nothing saw, but his own sweet maid with eyes upraised, as one that prayed. the touch, the sight, had passed away, and in its stead that vision blest, which comforted her after-rest while in the lady's arms she lay, had put a rapture in her breast, and on her lips and o'er her eyes spread smiles like light! with new surprise, 'what ails then my belovèd child? the baron said—his daughter mild made answer, 'all will yet be well!' i ween, she had no power to tell aught else: so mighty was the spell. yet he, who saw this geraldine, had deemed her sure a thing divine: such sorrow with such grace she blended, as if she feared she had offended sweet christabel, that gentle maid! and with such lowly tones she prayed she might be sent without delay home to her father's mansion. 'nay! nay, by my soul!' said leoline. 'ho! bracy the bard, the charge be thine! go thou, with sweet music and loud, and take two steeds with trappings proud, and take the youth whom thou lov'st best to bear thy harp, and learn thy song, and clothe you both in solemn vest, and over the mountains haste along, lest wandering folk, that are abroad, detain you on the valley road. 'and when he has crossed the irthing flood, my merry bard! he hastes, he hastes up knorren moor, through halegarth wood, and reaches soon that castle good which stands and threatens scotland's wastes. 'bard bracy! bard bracy! your horses are fleet, ye must ride up the hall, your music so sweet, more loud than your horses' echoing feet! and loud and loud to lord roland call, thy daughter is safe in langdale hall! thy beautiful daughter is safe and free— sir leoline greets thee thus through me! he bids thee come without delay with all thy numerous array and take thy lovely daughter home: and he will meet thee on the way with all his numerous array white with their panting palfreys' foam: and, by mine honour! i will say, that i repent me of the day when i spake words of fierce disdain to roland de vaux of tryermaine!— —for since that evil hour hath flown, many a summer's sun hath shone; yet ne'er found i a friend again like roland de vaux of tryermaine. the lady fell, and clasped his knees, her face upraised, her eyes o'erflowing; and bracy replied, with faltering voice, his gracious hail on all bestowing!— 'thy words, thou sire of christabel, are sweeter than my harp can tell; yet might i gain a boon of thee, this day my journey should not be, so strange a dream hath come to me, that i had vowed with music loud to clear yon wood from thing unblest. warned by a vision in my rest! for in my sleep i saw that dove, that gentle bird, whom thou dost love, and call'st by thy own daughter's name— sir leoline! i saw the same fluttering, and uttering fearful moan, among the green herbs in the forest alone. which when i saw and when i heard, i wonder'd what might ail the bird; for nothing near it could i see save the grass and green herbs underneath the old tree. 'and in my dream methought i went to search out what might there be found; and what the sweet bird's trouble meant, that thus lay fluttering on the ground. i went and peered, and could descry no cause for her distressful cry; but yet for her dear lady's sake i stooped, methought, the dove to take, when lo! i saw a bright green snake coiled around its wings and neck. green as the herbs on which it couched, close by the dove's its head it crouched; and with the dove it heaves and stirs, swelling its neck as she swelled hers! i woke; it was the midnight hour, the clock was echoing in the tower; but though my slumber was gone by, this dream it would not pass away— it seems to live upon my eye! and thence i vowed this self-same day with music strong and saintly song to wander through the forest bare, lest aught unholy loiter there.' thus bracy said: the baron, the while, half-listening heard him with a smile; then turned to lady geraldine, his eyes made up of wonder and love; and said in courtly accents fine, 'sweet maid, lord roland's beauteous dove, with arms more strong than harp or song, thy sire and i will crush the snake!' he kissed her forehead as he spake, and geraldine in maiden wise casting down her large bright eyes, with blushing cheek and courtesy fine she turned her from sir leoline; softly gathering up her train, that o'er her right arm fell again; and folded her arms across her chest, and couched her head upon her breast, and looked askance at christabel jesu, maria, shield her well! a snake's small eye blinks dull and shy; and the lady's eyes they shrunk in her head, each shrunk up to a serpent's eye and with somewhat of malice, and more of dread, at christabel she looked askance!— one moment—and the sight was fled! but christabel in dizzy trance stumbling on the unsteady ground shuddered aloud, with a hissing sound; and geraldine again turned round, and like a thing, that sought relief, full of wonder and full of grief, she rolled her large bright eyes divine wildly on sir leoline. the maid, alas! her thoughts are gone, she nothing sees—no sight but one! the maid, devoid of guile and sin, i know not how, in fearful wise, so deeply she had drunken in that look, those shrunken serpent eyes, that all her features were resigned to this sole image in her mind: and passively did imitate that look of dull and treacherous hate! and thus she stood, in dizzy trance; still picturing that look askance with forced unconscious sympathy full before her father's view— as far as such a look could be in eyes so innocent and blue! and when the trance was o'er, the maid paused awhile, and inly prayed: then falling at the baron's feet, 'by my mother's soul do i entreat that thou this woman send away!' she said: and more she could not say: for what she knew she could not tell, o'er-mastered by the mighty spell. why is thy cheek so wan and wild, sir leoline? thy only child lies at thy feet, thy joy, thy pride, so fair, so innocent, so mild; the same, for whom thy lady died! o by the pangs of her dear mother think thou no evil of thy child! for her, and thee, and for no other, she prayed the moment ere she died: prayed that the babe for whom she died, might prove her dear lord's joy and pride! that prayer her deadly pangs beguiled, sir leoline! and wouldst thou wrong thy only child, her child and thine? within the baron's heart and brain if thoughts, like these, had any share, they only swelled his rage and pain, and did but work confusion there. his heart was cleft with pain and rage, his cheeks they quivered, his eyes were wild, dishonoured thus in his old age; dishonoured by his only child, and all his hospitality to the wronged daughter of his friend by more than woman's jealousy brought thus to a disgraceful end— he rolled his eye with stern regard upon the gentle minstrel bard, and said in tones abrupt, austere— 'why, bracy! dost thou loiter here? i bade thee hence!' the bard obeyed; and turning from his own sweet maid, the agèd knight, sir leoline, led forth the lady geraldine! the conclusion to part ii a little child, a limber elf, singing, dancing to itself, a fairy thing with red round cheeks, that always finds, and never seeks, makes such a vision to the sight as fills a father's eyes with light; and pleasures flow in so thick and fast upon his heart, that he at last must needs express his love's excess with words of unmeant bitterness. perhaps 'tis pretty to force together thoughts so all unlike each other; to mutter and mock a broken charm, to dally with wrong that does no harm. perhaps 'tis tender too and pretty at each wild word to feel within a sweet recoil of love and pity. and what, if in a world of sin (o sorrow and shame should this be true!) such giddiness of heart and brain comes seldom save from rage and pain, so talks as it 's most used to do. <line>","living,death,nature,landscapes & pastorals,spring,stars, planets, heavens,trees & flowers,weather,religion,christianity,mythology & folklore,ghosts & the supernatural,horror"

then, what must the blinded eyes have seen to wish to see no more! for, i have seen, in the eyes regarding me, or regarding my brother, have seen, deep in the farthest valley of the eye, have seen a flame leap up, then flicker and go out, have seen a veil come down, leaving myself, and the other, alone in that cave which every soul remembers, and out of which, desperately afraid, i turn, turn, stagger, stumble out, into the healing air, fall flat on the healing ground, singing praises, counselling my heart, my soul, to praise. what is it that this people cannot forget? surely, they cannot be deluded as to imagine that their crimes are original? there is nothing in the least original about the fiery tongs to the eyeballs, the sex torn from the socket, the infant ripped from the womb, the brains dashed out against rock, nothing original about judas, or peter, or you or me: nothing: we are liars and cowards all, or nearly all, or nearly all the time: for we also ride the lightning, answer the thunder, penetrate whirlwinds, curl up on the floor of the sun, and pick our teeth with thunderbolts. then, perhaps they imagine that their crimes are not crimes? perhaps. perhaps that is why they cannot repent, why there is no possibility of repentance. manifest destiny is a hymn to madness, feeding on itself, ending (when it ends) in madness: the action is blindness and pain, pain bringing a torpor so deep that every act is willed, is desperately forced, is willed to be a blow: the hand becomes a fist, the prick becomes a club, the womb a dangerous swamp, the hope, and fear, of love is acid in the marrow of the bone. no, their fire is not quenched, nor can be: the oil feeding the flames being the unadmitted terror of the wrath of god. yes. but let us put it in another, less theological way: though theology has absolutely nothing to do with what i am trying to say. but the moment god is mentioned theology is summoned to buttress or demolish belief: an exercise which renders belief irrelevant and adds to the despair of fifth avenue on any afternoon, the people moving, homeless, through the city, praying to find sanctuary before the sky and the towers come tumbling down, before the earth opens, as it does in superman. they know that no one will appear to turn back time, they know it, just as they know that the earth has opened before and will open again, just as they know that their empire is falling, is doomed, nothing can hold it up, nothing. we are not talking about belief. <line> <line>3 <line> <line>i wonder how they think <line> <line> <line> <line>the niggers made, make it, how come the niggers are still here. but, then, again, i don't think they dare to think of that: no: i'm fairly certain they don't think of that at all. lord, i with the alabaster lady of the house, with beulah. beulah about sixty, built in four-square, biceps like mohammed ali, she at the stove, fixing biscuits, scrambling eggs and bacon, fixing coffee, pouring juice, and the lady of the house, she say, she don't know how she'd get along without beulah and beulah just silently grunts, i reckon you don't, and keeps on keeping on and the lady of the house say she's just like one of the family, and beulah turns, gives me a look, sucks her teeth and rolls her eyes in the direction of the lady's back, and keeps on keeping on. while they are containing russia and entering onto the quicksand of china and patronizing africa, and calculating the caribbean plunder, and the south china sea booty, the niggers are aware that no one has discussed anything at all with the niggers. well. niggers don't own nothing, got no flag, even our names are hand-me-downs and you don't change that by calling yourself x: sometimes that just makes it worse, like obliterating the path that leads back to whence you came, and to where you can begin. and, anyway, none of this changes the reality, which is, for example, that i do not want my son to die in guantanamo, or anywhere else, for that matter, serving the stars and stripes. (i've seen some stars. i got some stripes.) neither (incidentally) has anyone discussed the bomb with the niggers: the incoherent feeling is, the less the nigger knows about the bomb, the better: the lady of the house smiles nervously in your direction as though she had just been overheard discussing family, or sexual secrets, and changes the subject to education, or full employment, or the welfare rolls, the smile saying, don't be dismayed. we know how you feel. you can trust us. yeah. i would like to believe you. but we are not talking about belief. <line> <line>4the sons of greed, the heirs of plunder, are approaching the end of their journey: it is amazing that they approach without wonder, as though they have, themselves, become that scorched and blasphemed earth, the stricken buffalo, the slaughtered tribes, the endless, virgin, bloodsoaked plain, the famine, the silence, the children's eyes, murder masquerading as salvation, seducing every democratic eye, the mouths of truth and anguish choked with cotton, rape delirious with the fragrance of magnolia, the hacking of the fruit of their loins to pieces, hey! the tar-baby sons and nephews, the high-yaller <line> <line> nieces, <line> <line>and tom's black prick hacked off <line> <line> <line> <line>to rustle in crinoline, to hang, heaviest of heirlooms, between the pink and alabaster breasts of the great man's lady, or worked into the sash at the waist of the high-yaller creole bitch, or niece, a chunk of shining brown-black satin, staring, staring, like the single eye of god: creation yearns to re-create a time when we were able to recognize a crime. alas, my stricken kinsmen, the party is over: there have never been any white people, anywhere: the trick was accomplished with mirrors— look: where is your image now? where your inheritance, on what rock stands this pride? oh, i counsel you, leave history alone. she is exhausted, sitting, staring into her dressing-room mirror, and wondering what rabbit, now, to pull out of what hat, and seriously considering retirement, even though she knows her public dare not let her go. she must change. yes. history must change. a slow, syncopated relentless music begins suggesting her re-entry, transformed, virginal as she was, in the beginning, untouched, as the word was spoken, before the rape which debased her to be the whore of multitudes, or, as one might say, before she became the star, whose name, above our title, carries the show, making history the patsy, responsible for every flubbed line, every missed cue, responsible for the life and death, of all bright illusions and dark delusions, lord, history is weary of her unspeakable liaison with time, for time and history have never seen eye to eye: time laughs at history and time and time and time again time traps history in a lie. but we always, somehow, managed to roar history back onstage to take another bow, to justify, to sanctify the journey until now. time warned us to ask for our money back, and disagreed with history as concerns colours white and black. not only do we come from further back, but the light of the sun marries all colours as one. kinsmen, i have seen you betray your saviour (it is you who call him saviour) so many times, and i have spoken to him about you, behind your back. quite a lot has been going on behind your back, and, if your phone has not yet been disconnected, it will soon begin to ring: informing you, for example, that a whole generation, in africa, is about to die, and a new generation is about to rise, and will not need your bribes, or your persuasions, any more: not your morality. no plundered gold— ah! kinsmen, if i could make you see the crime is not what you have done to me! it is you who are blind, you, bowed down with chains, you, whose children mock you, and seek another master, you, who cannot look man or woman or child in the eye, whose sleep is blank with terror, for whom love died long ago, somewhere between the airport and the safe-deposit box, the buying and selling of rising or falling stocks, you, who miss zanzibar and madagascar and kilimanjaro and lions and tigers and elephants and zebras and flying fish and crocodiles and alligators and leopards and crashing waterfalls and endless rivers, flowers fresher than eden, silence sweeter than the grace of god, passion at every turning, throbbing in the bush, thicker, oh, than honey in the hive, dripping dripping opening, welcoming, aching from toe to bottom to spine, sweet heaven on the line to last forever, yes, but, now, rejoicing ends, man, a price remains to pay, your innocence costs too much and we can't carry you on our books or our backs, any longer: baby, find another eden, another apple tree, somewhere, if you can, and find some other natives, somewhere else, to listen to you bellow till you come, just like a man, but we don't need you, are sick of being a fantasy to feed you, and of being the principal accomplice to your crime: for, it is your crime, now, the cross to which you cling, your alpha and omega for everything. well (others have told you) your clown's grown weary, the puppet master is bored speechless with this monotonous disaster, and is long gone, does not belong to you, any more than my woman, or my child, ever belonged to you. during this long travail our ancestors spoke to us, and we listened, and we tried to make you hear life in our song but now it matters not at all to me whether you know what i am talking about—or not: i know why we are not blinded by your brightness, are able to see you, who cannot see us. i know why we are still here. godspeed. the niggers are calculating, from day to day, life everlasting, and wish you well: but decline to imitate the son of the morning, and rule in hell. <line>","history & politics,money & economics,race & ethnicity,war & conflict"

they opened up the barrowssixty years since, while i was scaring sparrows.they thought as there was something to find there,but couldn’t find it, by digging, anywhere.”to turn back then and seek him, where was the use?there were three manningfords,—abbots, bohun, and bruce:and whether alton, not manningford, it was,my memory could not decide, becausethere was both alton barnes and alton priors.all had their churches, graveyards, farms, and byres,lurking to one side up the paths and lanes,seldom well seen except by aeroplanes;and when bells rang, or pigs squealed, or cocks crowed,then only heard. ages ago the roadapproached. the people stood and looked and turned.nor asked it to come nearer, nor yet learnedto move out there and dwell in all men’s dust.and yet withal they shot the weathercock, justbecause ’twas he crowed out of tune, they said:so now the copper weathercock is dead.if they had reaped their dandelions and soldthem fairly, they could have afforded gold.many years passed, and i went back againamong those villages, and looked for menwho might have known my ancient. he himselfhad long been dead or laid upon the shelf,i thought. one man i asked about him roaredat

hob.when there were kings in kent this very lob,whose sheep grew fat and he himself grew merry,wedded the king’s daughter of canterbury;for he alone, unlike squire, lord, and king,watched a night by her without slumbering;he kept both waking. when he was but a ladhe won a rich man’s heiress, deaf, dumb, and sad,by rousing her to laugh at him. he carriedhis donkey on his back. so they were married.and while he was a little cobbler’s boyhe tricked the giant coming to destroyshrewsbury by flood. ‘and how far is it yet?’the giant asked in passing. ‘i forget;but see these shoes i‘ve worn out on the roadand we’re not there yet.’ he emptied out his loadof shoes for mending. the giant let fall from his spadethe earth for damming severn, and thus madethe wrekin hill; and little ercall hillrose where the giant scraped his boots. while stillso young, our jack was chief of gotham’s sages.but long before he could have been wise, agesearlier than this, while he grew thick and strongand ate his bacon, or, at times, sang a songand merely smelt it, as jack the giant-killerhe made a name. he too ground up the miller,the yorkshireman who ground men’s bones for flour.“do you believe jack dead before his hour?or that his name is walker, or bottlesford,or button, a mere clown, or squire, or lord?the man you saw,—lob-lie-by-the-fire, jack cade,jack smith, jack moon, poor jack of every trade,young jack, or old jack, or jack what-d’ye-call,jack-in-the-hedge, or robin-run-by-the-wall,robin hood, ragged robin, lazy bob,one of the lords of no man’s land, good lob,—although he was seen dying at waterloo,hastings, agincourt, and sedgemoor too,—lives yet. he never will admit he is deadtill millers cease to grind men’s bones for bread,not till our weathercock crows once againand i remove my house out of the laneon to the road.” with this he disappearedin hazel and thorn tangled with old-man’s-beard.but one glimpse of his back, as there he stood,choosing his way, proved him of old jack’s blood,young jack perhaps, and now a wiltshiremanas he has oft been since his days began. <line>","living,activities,travels & journeys,mythology & folklore"

and from despair thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue vain warr with heav'n, and by success untaught his proud imaginations thus displaid. powers and dominions, deities of heav'n, for since no deep within her gulf can hold immortal vigor, though opprest and fall'n, i give not heav'n for lost. from this descent celestial vertues rising, will appear more glorious and more dread then from no fall, and trust themselves to fear no second fate: mee though just right, and the fixt laws of heav'n did first create your leader, next free choice, with what besides, in counsel or in fight, hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss thus farr at least recover'd, hath much more establisht in a safe unenvied throne yielded with full consent. the happier state in heav'n, which follows dignity, might draw envy from each inferior; but who here will envy whom the highest place exposes formost to stand against the thunderers aim your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share of endless pain? where there is then no good for which to strive, no strife can grow up there from faction; for none sure will claim in hell precedence, none, whose portion is so small of present pain, that with ambitious mind will covet more. with this advantage then to union, and firm faith, and firm accord, more then can be in heav'n, we now return to claim our just inheritance of old, surer to prosper then prosperity could have assur'd us; and by what best way, whether of open warr or covert guile, we now debate; who can advise, may speak. he ceas'd, and next him moloc, scepter'd king stood up, the strongest and the fiercest spirit that fought in heav'n; now fiercer by despair: his trust was with th' eternal to be deem'd equal in strength, and rather then be less car'd not to be at all; with that care lost went all his fear: of god, or hell, or worse he reck'd not, and these words thereafter spake. my sentence is for open warr: of wiles, more unexpert, i boast not: them let those contrive who need, or when they need, not now. for while they sit contriving, shall the rest, millions that stand in arms, and longing wait the signal to ascend, sit lingring here heav'ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place accept this dark opprobrious den of shame, the prison of his tyranny who reigns by our delay? no, let us rather choose arm'd with hell flames and fury all at once o're heav'ns high towrs to force resistless way, turning our tortures into horrid arms against the torturer; when to meet the noise of his almighty engin he shall hear infernal thunder, and for lightning see black fire and horror shot with equal rage among his angels; and his throne it self mixt with tartarean sulphur, and strange fire, his own invented torments. but perhaps the way seems difficult and steep to scale with upright wing against a higher foe. let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench of that forgetful lake benumm not still, that in our proper motion we ascend up to our native seat: descent and fall to us is adverse. who but felt of late when the fierce foe hung on our brok'n rear insulting, and pursu'd us through the deep, with what compulsion and laborious flight we sunk thus low? th' ascent is easie then; th' event is fear'd; should we again provoke our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find to our destruction: if there be in hell fear to be worse destroy'd: what can be worse then to dwell here, driv'n out from bliss, condemn'd in this abhorred deep to utter woe; where pain of unextinguishable fire must exercise us without hope of end the vassals of his anger, when the scourge inexorably, and the torturing hour calls us to penance? more destroy'd then thus we should be quite abolisht and expire. what fear we then? what doubt we to incense his utmost ire? which to the highth enrag'd, will either quite consume us, and reduce to nothing this essential, happier farr then miserable to have eternal being: or if our substance be indeed divine, and cannot cease to be, we are at worst on this side nothing; and by proof we feel our power sufficient to disturb his heav'n, and with perpetual inrodes to allarme, though inaccessible, his fatal throne: which if not victory is yet revenge. he ended frowning, and his look denounc'd desperate revenge, and battel dangerous to less then gods. on th' other side up rose belial, in act more graceful and humane; a fairer person lost not heav'n; he seemd for dignity compos'd and high exploit: but all was false and hollow; though his tongue dropt manna, and could make the worse appear the better reason, to perplex and dash maturest counsels: for his thoughts were low; to vice industrious, but to nobler deeds timorous and slothful: yet he pleas'd the ear, and with perswasive accent thus began. i should be much for open warr, o peers, as not behind in hate; if what was urg'd main reason to perswade immediate warr, did not disswade me most, and seem to cast ominous conjecture on the whole success: when he who most excels in fact of arms, in what he counsels and in what excels mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair and utter dissolution, as the scope of all his aim, after some dire revenge. first, what revenge? the towrs of heav'n are fill'd with armed watch, that render all access impregnable; oft on the bordering deep encamp thir legions, or with obscure wing scout farr and wide into the realm of night, scorning surprize. or could we break our way by force, and at our heels all hell should rise with blackest insurrection, to confound heav'ns purest light, yet our great enemy all incorruptible would on his throne sit unpolluted, and th' ethereal mould incapable of stain would soon expel her mischief, and purge off the baser fire victorious. thus repuls'd, our final hope is flat despair: we must exasperate th' almighty victor to spend all his rage, and that must end us, that must be our cure, to be no more; sad cure; for who would loose, though full of pain, this intellectual being, those thoughts that wander through eternity, to perish rather, swallowd up and lost in the wide womb of uncreated night, devoid of sense and motion? and who knows, let this be good, whether our angry foe can give it, or will ever? how he can is doubtful; that he never will is sure. will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, belike through impotence, or unaware, to give his enemies thir wish, and end them in his anger, whom his anger saves to punish endless? wherefore cease we then? say they who counsel warr, we are decreed, reserv'd and destin'd to eternal woe; whatever doing, what can we suffer more, what can we suffer worse? is this then worst, thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in arms? what when we fled amain, pursu'd and strook with heav'ns afflicting thunder, and besought the deep to shelter us? this hell then seem'd a refuge from those wounds: or when we lay chain'd on the burning lake? that sure was worse. what if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage and plunge us in the flames? or from above should intermitted vengeance arm again his red right hand to plague us? what if all her stores were open'd, and this firmament of hell should spout her cataracts of fire impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall one day upon our heads; while we perhaps designing or exhorting glorious warr, caught in a fierie tempest shall be hurl'd each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk under yon boyling ocean, wrapt in chains; there to converse with everlasting groans, unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd, ages of hopeless end; this would be worse. warr therefore, open or conceal'd, alike my voice disswades; for what can force or guile with him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye views all things at one view? he from heav'ns highth all these our motions vain, sees and derides; not more almighty to resist our might then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. shall we then live thus vile, the race of heav'n thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer here chains and these torments? better these then worse by my advice; since fate inevitable subdues us, and omnipotent decree, the victors will. to suffer, as to doe, our strength is equal, nor the law unjust that so ordains: this was at first resolv'd, if we were wise, against so great a foe contending, and so doubtful what might fall. i laugh, when those who at the spear are bold and vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear what yet they know must follow, to endure exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain, the sentence of thir conquerour: this is now our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, our supream foe in time may much remit his anger, and perhaps thus farr remov'd not mind us not offending, satisfi'd with what is punish't; whence these raging fires will slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames. our purer essence then will overcome thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not feel, or chang'd at length, and to the place conformd in temper and in nature, will receive familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain; this horror will grow milde, this darkness light, besides what hope the never-ending flight of future dayes may bring, what chance, what change worth waiting, since our present lot appeers for happy though but ill, for ill not worst, if we procure not to our selves more woe. thus belial with words cloath'd in reasons garb counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath, not peace: and after him thus mammon spake. either to disinthrone the king of heav'n we warr, if warr be best, or to regain our own right lost: him to unthrone we then may hope when everlasting fathe shall yeild to fickle chance and chaos judge the strife: the former vain to hope argues as vain the latter: for what place can be for us within heav'ns bound, unless heav'ns lord supream we overpower? suppose he should relent and publish grace to all, on promise made of new subjection; with what eyes could we stand in his presence humble, and receive strict laws impos'd, to celebrate his throne with warbl'd hymns, and to his god head sing forc't halleluia's; while he lordly sits our envied sovran, and his altar breathes ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers, our servile offerings. this must be our task in heav'n this our delight; how wearisom eternity so spent in worship paid to whom we hate. let us not then pursue by force impossible, by leave obtain'd unacceptable, though in heav'n, our state of splendid vassalage, but rather seek our own good from our selves, and from our own live to our selves, though in this vast recess, free, and to none accountable, preferring hard liberty before the easie yoke of servile pomp. our greatness will appeer then most conspicuous, when great things of small, useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse we can create, and in what place so e're thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain through labour and indurance. this deep world of darkness do we dread? how oft amidst thick clouds and dark doth heav'ns all-ruling sire choose to reside, his glory unobscur'd, and with the majesty of darkness round covers his throne; from whence deep thunders roar must'ring thir rage, and heav'n resembles hell? as he our darkness, cannot we his light imitate when we please? this desart soile wants not her hidden lustre, gemms and gold; nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise magnificence; and what can heav'n shew more? our torments also may in length of time become our elements, these piercing fires as soft as now severe, our temper chang'd into their temper; which must needs remove the sensible of pain. all things invite to peaceful counsels, and the settl'd state of order, how in safety best we may compose our present evils, with regard of what we are and were, dismissing quite all thoughts of warr: ye have what i advise. he scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld th' assembly, as when hollow rocks retain the sound of blustring winds, which all night long had rous'd the sea, now with hoarse cadence lull sea-faring men orewatcht, whose bark by chance or pinnace anchors in a craggy bay after the tempest: such applause was heard as mammon ended, and his sentence pleas'd, advising peace: for such another field they dreaded worse then hell: so much the fear of thunder and the sword of michael wrought still within them; and no less desire to found this nether empire, which might rise by pollicy, and long process of time, in emulation opposite to heav'n. which when beelzebub perceiv'd, then whom, satan except, none higher sat, with grave aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd a pillar of state; deep on his front engraven deliberation sat and public care; and princely counsel in his face yet shon, majestic though in ruin: sage he stood with atlantean shoulders fit to bear the weight of mightiest monarchies; his look drew audience and attention still as night or summers noon-tide air, while thus he spake. thrones and imperial powers, off-spring of heav'n ethereal vertues; or these titles now must we renounce, and changing stile be call'd princes of hell? for so the popular vote inclines, here to continue, and build up here a growing empire; doubtless; while we dream, and know not that the king of heav'n hath doom'd this place our dungeon, not our safe retreat beyond his potent arm, to live exempt from heav'ns high jurisdiction, in new league banded against his throne, but to remaine in strictest bondage, though thus far remov'd, under th' inevitable curb, reserv'd his captive multitude: for he, be sure in heighth or depth, still first and last will reign sole king, and of his kingdom loose no part by our revolt, but over hell extend his empire, and with iron scepter rule us here, as with his golden those in heav'n. what sit we then projecting peace and warr? warr hath determin'd us, and foild with loss irreparable; tearms of peace yet none voutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'n to us enslav'd, but custody severe, and stripes, and arbitrary punishment inflicted? and what peace can we return, but to our power hostility and hate, untam'd reluctance, and revenge though slow, yet ever plotting how the conqueror least may reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce in doing what we most in suffering feel? nor will occasion want, nor shall we need with dangerous expedition to invade heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or siege, or ambush from the deep. what if we find some easier enterprize? there is a place (if ancient and prophetic fame in heav'n err not) another world, the happy seat of some new race call'd man, about this time to be created like to us, though less in power and excellence, but favour'd more of him who rules above; so was his will pronounc'd among the gods, and by an oath, that shook heav'ns whol circumference, confirm'd. thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn what creatures there inhabit, of what mould, or substance, how endu'd, and what thir power, and where thir weakness, how attempted best, by force or suttlety: though heav'n be shut, and heav'ns high arbitrator sit secure in his own strength, this place may lye expos'd the utmost border of his kingdom, left to their defence who hold it: here perhaps som advantagious act may be achiev'd by sudden onset, either with hell fire to waste his whole creation, or possess all as our own, and drive as we were driven, the punie habitants, or if not drive, seduce them to our party, that thir god may prove thir foe, and with repenting hand abolish his own works. this would surpass common revenge, and interrupt his joy in our confusion, and our joy upraise in his disturbance; when his darling sons huri'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse thir frail original, and faded bliss, faded so soon. advise if this be worth attempting, or to sit in darkness here hatching vain empires. thus beelzebub pleaded his devilish counsel, first devis'd by satan, and in part propos'd: for whence, but from the author of all ill could spring so deep a malice, to confound the race of mankind in one root, and earth with hell to mingle and involve, done all to spite the great creatour? but thir spite still serves his glory to augment. the bold design pleas'd highly those infernal states, and joy sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full assent they vote: whereat his speech he thus renews. well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate, synod of gods, and like to what ye are, great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep will once more lift us up, in spight of fate, neerer our ancient seat; perhaps in view of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring arms and opportune excursion we may chance re-enter heav'n; or else in some milde zone dwell not unvisited of heav'ns fair light secure, and at the brightning orient beam purge off this gloom; the soft delicious air, to heal the scarr of these corrosive fires shall breathe her balme. but first whom shall we send in search of this new world, whom shall we find sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet the dark unbottom'd infinite abyss and through the palpable obscure find out his uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight upborn with indefatigable wings over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive the happy ile; what strength, what art can then suffice, or what evasion bear him safe through the strict senteries and stations thick of angels watching round? here he had need all circumspection, and we now no less choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send, the weight of all and our last hope relies. this said, he sat; and expectation held his look suspence, awaiting who appeer'd to second, or oppose, or undertake the perilous attempt: but all sat mute, pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each in others count'nance read his own dismay astonisht: none among the choice and prime of those heav'n-warring champions could be found so hardie as to proffer or accept alone the dreadful voyage; till at last satan, whom now transcendent glory rais'd above his fellows, with monarchal pride conscious of highest worth, unmov'd thus spake. o progeny of heav'n, empyreal thrones, with reason hath deep silence and demurr seis'd us, though undismaid: long is the way and hard, that out of hell leads up to light; our prison strong, this huge convex of fire, outrageous to devour, immures us round ninefold, and gates of burning adamant barr'd over us prohibit all egress. these past, if any pass, the void profound of unessential night receives him next wide gaping, and with utter loss of being threatens him, plung'd in that abortive gulf. if thence he scape into whatever world, or unknown region, what remains him less then unknown dangers and as hard escape. but i should ill become this throne, o peers, and this imperial sov'ranty, adorn'd with splendor, arm'd with power, if aught propos'd and judg'd of public moment, in the shape of difficulty or danger could deterr mee from attempting. wherefore do i assume these royalties, and not refuse to reign, refusing to accept as great a share of hazard as of honour, due alike to him who reigns, and so much to him due of hazard more, as he above the rest high honourd sits? go therfore mighty powers, terror of heav'n, though fall'n; intend at home, while here shall be our home, what best may ease the present misery, and render hell more tollerable; if there be cure or charm to respite or deceive, or slack the pain of this ill mansion: intermit no watch against a wakeful foe, while i abroad through all the coasts of dark destruction seek deliverance for us all: this enterprize none shall partake with me. thus saying rose the monarch, and prevented all reply, prudent, least from his resolution rais'd others among the chief might offer now (certain to be refus'd) what erst they feard; and so refus'd might in opinion stand his rivals, winning cheap the high repute which he through hazard huge must earn. but they dreaded not more th' adventure then his voice forbidding; and at once with him they rose; thir rising all at once was as the sound of thunder heard remote. towards him they bend with awful reverence prone; and as a god extoll him equal to the highest in heav'n: nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd, that for the general safety he despis'd his own: for neither do the spirits damn'd loose all thir virtue; least bad men should boast thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, or clos ambition varnisht o're with zeal. thus they thir doubtful consultations dark ended rejoycing in thir matchless chief: as when from mountain tops the dusky clouds ascending, while the north wind sleeps, o'respread heav'ns chearful face, the lowring element scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip snow, or showre; if chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet extend his ev'ning beam, the fields revive, the birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. o shame to men! devil with devil damn'd firm concord holds, men onely disagree of creatures rational, though under hope of heavenly grace: and god proclaiming peace, yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife among themselves, and levie cruel warres, wasting the earth, each other to destroy: as if (which might induce us to accord) man had not hellish foes anow besides, that day and night for his destruction waite. the stygian counsel thus dissolv'd; and forth in order came the grand infernal peers, midst came thir mighty paramount, and seemd alone th' antagonist of heav'n, nor less than hells dread emperour with pomp supream, and god-like imitated state; him round a globe of fierie seraphim inclos'd with bright imblazonrie, and horrent arms. then of thir session ended they bid cry with trumpets regal sound the great result: toward the four winds four speedy cherubim put to thir mouths the sounding alchymie by haralds voice explain'd: the hollow abyss heard farr and wide, and all the host of hell with deafning shout, return'd them loud acclaim. thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais'd by false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers disband, and wandring, each his several way pursues, as inclination or sad choice leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain the irksom hours, till this great chief return. part on the plain, or in the air sublime upon the wing, or in swift race contend, as at th' olympian games or pythian fields; part curb thir fierie steeds, or shun the goal with rapid wheels, or fronted brigads form. as when to warn proud cities warr appears wag'd in the troubl'd skie, and armies rush to battel in the clouds, before each van prick forth the aerie knights, and couch thir spears till thickest legions close; with feats of arms from either end of heav'n the welkin burns. others with vast typhoean rage more fell rend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air in whirlwind; hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. as when alcides from oechalia crown'd with conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore through pain up by the roots thessalian pines, and lichas from the top of oeta threw into th' euboic sea. others more milde, retreated in a silent valley, sing with notes angelical to many a harp thir own heroic deeds and hapless fall by doom of battel; and complain that fate free vertue should enthrall to force or chance. thir song was partial, but the harmony (what could it less when spirits immortal sing?) suspended hell, and took with ravishment the thronging audience. in discourse more sweet (for eloquence the soul, song charms the sense,) others apart sat on a hill retir'd, in thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high of providence, foreknowledge, will and fate, fixt fate, free will, foreknowledg absolute, and found no end, in wandring mazes lost. of good and evil much they argu'd then, of happiness and final misery, passion and apathie, and glory and shame, vain wisdom all, and false philosophie: yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm pain for a while or anguish, and excite fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brest with stubborn patience as with triple steel. another part in squadrons and gross bands, on bold adventure to discover wide that dismal world, if any clime perhaps might yield them easier habitation, bend four ways thir flying march, along the banks of four infernal rivers that disgorge into the burning lake thir baleful streams; abhorred styx the flood of deadly hate, sad acheron of sorrow, black and deep; cocytus, nam'd of lamentation loud heard on the ruful stream; fierce phlegeton whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. farr off from these a slow and silent stream, lethe the river of oblivion roules her watrie labyrinth, whereof who drinks, forthwith his former state and being forgets, forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. beyond this flood a frozen continent lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms of whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, a gulf profound as that serbonian bog betwixt damiata and mount casius old, where armies whole have sunk: the parching air burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of fire. thither by harpy-footed furies hail'd, at certain revolutions all the damn'd are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce, from beds of raging fire to starve in ice thir soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine immovable, infixt, and frozen round, periods of time, thence hurried back to fire. they ferry over this lethean sound both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment, and wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach the tempting stream, with one small drop to loose in sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, all in one moment, and so neer the brink; but fate withstands, and to oppose th' attempt medusa with gorgonian terror guards the ford, and of it self the water flies all taste of living wight, as once it fled the lip of tantalus. thus roving on in confus'd march forlorn, th' adventrous bands with shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast view'd first thir lamentable lot, and found no rest: through many a dark and drearie vaile they pass'd, and many a region dolorous, o're many a frozen, many a fierie alpe, rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death, a universe of death, which god by curse created evil, for evil only good, where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds, perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, abominable, inutterable, and worse than fables yet have feign'd, or fear conceiv'd, gorgons and hydra's, and chimera's dire. mean while the adversary of god and man, satan with thoughts inflam'd of highest design, puts on swift wings, and towards the gates of hell explores his solitary flight; som times he scours the right hand coast, som times the left, now shaves with level wing the deep, then soares up to the fiery concave touring high. as when farr off at sea a fleet descri'd hangs in the clouds, by aequinoctial winds close sailing from bengala, or the iles of ternate and tidore, whence merchants bring thir spicie drugs: they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole. so seem'd farr off the flying fiend: at last appeer hell bounds high reaching to the horrid roof, and thrice threefold the gates; three folds were brass, three iron, three of adamantine rock, impenetrable, impal'd with circling fire, yet unconsum'd. before the gates there sat on either side a formidable shape; the one seem'd woman to the waste, and fair, but ended foul in many a scaly fould voluminous and vast, a serpent arm'd with mortal sting: about her middle round a cry of hell hounds never ceasing bark'd with wide cerberian mouths full loud, and rung a hideous peal: yet, when they list, would creep, if aught disturb'd thir noyse, into her woomb, and kennel there, yet there still bark'd and howl'd, within unseen. farr less abhorrd than these vex'd scylla bathing in the sea that parts calabria from the hoarce trinacrian shore: nor uglier follow the night-hag, when call'd in secret, riding through the air she comes lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to dance with lapland witches, while the labouring moon eclipses at thir charms. the other shape, if shape it might be call'd that shape had none distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb, or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd, for each seem'd either; black it stood as night, fierce as ten furies, terrible as hell, and shook a dreadful dart; what seem'd his head the likeness of a kingly crown had on. satan was now at hand, and from his seat the monster moving onward came as fast with horrid strides, hell trembled as he strode. th' undaunted fiend what this might be admir'd, admir'd, not fear'd; god and his son except, created thing naught valu'd he nor shun'd; and with disdainful look thus first began. whence and what art thou, execrable shape, that dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance thy miscreated front athwart my way to yonder gates? through them i mean to pass, that be assur'd, without leave askt of thee: retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, hell-born, not to contend with spirits of heav'n. to whom the goblin full of wrauth reply'd, art thou that traitor angel, art thou hee, who first broke peace in heav'n and faith, till then unbrok'n, and in proud rebellious arms drew after him the third part of heav'ns sons conjur'd against the highest, for which both thou and they outcast from god, are here condemn'd to waste eternal dayes in woe and pain? and reck'n'st thou thy self with spirits of heav'n, hell-doom'd, and breath'st defiance here and scorn where i reign king, and to enrage thee more, thy king and lord? back to thy punishment, false fugitive, and to thy speed add wings, least with a whip of scorpions i pursue thy lingring, or with one stroke of this dart strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before. so spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape, so speaking and so threatning, grew tenfold more dreadful and deform: on th' other side incenst with indignation satan stood unterrifi'd, and like a comet burn'd, that fires the length of ophiucus huge in th' artick sky, and from his horrid hair shakes pestilence and warr. each at the head level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall hands no second stroke intend, and such a frown each cast at th' other, as when two black clouds with heav'ns artillery fraught, come rattling on over the caspian, then stand front to front hov'ring a space, till winds the signal blow to joyn thir dark encounter in mid air: so frownd the mighty combatants, that hell grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood; for never but once more was either like to meet so great a foe: and now great deeds had been achiev'd, whereof all hell had rung, had not the snakie sorceress that sat fast by hell gate, and kept the fatal key, ris'n, and with hideous outcry rush'd between. o father, what intends thy hand, she cry'd, against thy only son? what fury o son, possesses thee to bend that mortal dart against thy fathers head? and know'st for whom; for him who sits above and laughs the while at thee ordain'd his drudge, to execute what e're his wrath, which he calls justice, bids, his wrath which one day will destroy ye both. she spake, and at her words the hellish pest forbore, then these to her satan return'd: so strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange thou interposest, that my sudden hand prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds what it intends; till first i know of thee, what thing thou art, thus double-form'd, and why in this infernal vaile first met thou call'st me father, and that fantasm ca11'st my son? i know thee not, nor ever saw till now sight more detestable then him and thee. t' whom thus the portress of hell gate reply'd; hast thou forgot me then, and do i seem now in thine eyes so foul, once deemd so fair in heav'n, when at th' assembly, and in sight of all the seraphim with thee combin'd in bold conspiracy against heav'ns king, all on a sudden miserable pain surpris'd thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm in darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast threw forth, till on the left side op'ning wide, likest to thee in shape and count'nance bright, then shining heav'nly fair, a goddess arm'd out of thy head i sprung: amazement seis'd all th' host of heav'n; back they recoild affraid at first, and call'd me sin, and for a sign portentous held me; but familiar grown, i pleas'd, and with attractive graces won the most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft thy self in me thy perfect image viewing becam'st enamour'd, and such joy thou took'st with me in secret, that my womb conceiv'd a growing burden. mean while warr arose, and fields were fought in heav'n; wherein remaind (for what could else) to our almighty foe cleer victory, to our part loss and rout through all the empyrean: down they fell driv'n headlong from the pitch of heaven, down into this deep, and in the general fall i also; at which time this powerful key into my hand was giv'n, with charge to keep these gates for ever shut, which none can pass without my op'ning. pensive here i sat alone, but long i sat not, till my womb pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. at last this odious offspring whom thou seest thine own begotten, breaking violent way tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain distorted, all my nether shape thus grew transform'd: but he my inbred enemie forth issu'd, brandishing his fatal dart made to destroy: i fled, and cry'd out death; hell trembl'd at the hideous name, and sigh'd from all her caves, and back resounded death. i fled, but he pursu'd (though more, it seems, inflam'd with lust then rage) and swifter far, mee overtook his mother all dismaid, and in embraces forcible and foule ingendring with me, of that rape begot these yelling monsters that with ceasless cry surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv'd and hourly born, with sorrow infinite to me, for when they list into the womb that bred them they return, and howle and gnaw my bowels, thir repast; then bursting forth a fresh with conscious terrours vex me round, that rest or intermission none i find. before mine eyes in opposition sits grim death my son and foe, who sets them on, and me his parent would full soon devour for want of other prey, but that he knows his end with mine involvd; and knows that i should prove a bitter morsel, and his bane, when ever that shall be; so fate pronounc'd. but thou o father, i forewarn thee, shun his deadly arrow; neither vainly hope to be invulnerable in those bright arms, though temper'd heav'nly, for that mortal dint, save he who reigns above, none can resist. she finish'd, and the suttle fiend his lore soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth. dear daughter, since thou claim'st me for thy sire, and my fair son here showst me, the dear pledge of dalliance had with thee in heav'n, and joys then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know i come no enemie, but to set free from out this dark and dismal house of pain, both him and thee, and all the heav'nly host of spirits that in our just pretenses arm'd fell with us from on high: from them i go this uncouth errand sole, and one for all my self expose, with lonely steps to tread th' unfounded deep, and through the void immense to search with wandring quest a place foretold should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now created vast and round, a place of bliss in the pourlieues of heav'n, and therein plac't a race of upstart creatures, to supply perhaps our vacant room, though more remov'd, least heav'n surcharg'd with potent multitude might hap to move new broiles: be this or aught then this more secret now design'd, i haste to know, and this once known, shall soon return, and bring ye to the place where thou and death shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen wing silently the buxom air, imbalm'd with odours; there ye shall be fed and fill'd immeasurably, all things shall be your prey. he ceas'd, for both seemd highly pleasd, and death grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear his famine should be fill'd, and blest his mawe destin'd to that good hour: no less rejoyc'd his mother bad, and thus bespake her sire. the key of this infernal pit by due, and by command of heav'ns all-powerful king i keep, by him forbidden to unlock these adamantine gates; against all force death ready stands to interpose his dart, fearless to be o'rmatcht by living might. but what ow i to his commands above who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down into this gloom of tartarus profound, to sit in hateful office here confin'd, inhabitant of heav'n, and heav'nlie-born, here in perpetual agonie and pain, with terrors and with clamors compasst round of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed: thou art my father, thou my author, thou my being gav'st me; whom should i obey but thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon to that new world of light and bliss, among the gods who live at ease, where i shall reign at thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems thy daughter and thy darling, without end. thus saying, from her side the fatal key, sad instrument of all our woe, she took; and towards the gate rouling her bestial train, forthwith the huge porcullis high up drew, which but her self not all the stygian powers could once have mov'd; then in the key-hole turns th' intricate wards, and every bolt and bar of massie iron or sollid rock with ease unfast'ns: on a sudden op'n flie with impetuous recoile and jarring sound th' infernal dores, and on thir hinges grate harsh thunder, that the lowest bottom shook of erebus. she op'nd, but to shut excel'd her power; the gates wide op'n stood, that with extended wings a bannerd host under spread ensigns marching might pass through with horse and chariots rankt in loose array; so wide they stood, and like a furnace mouth cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame. before thir eyes in sudden view appear the secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark illimitable ocean without bound, without dimension, where length, breadth, & highth, and time and place are lost; where eldest night and chaos. ancestors of nature, hold eternal anarchie, amidst the noise of endless warrs, and by confusion stand. for hot, cold, moist, and dry, four champions fierce strive here for maistrie, and to battel bring thir embryon atoms; they around the flag of each his faction, in thir several clanns, light-arm'd or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow, swarm populous, unnumber'd as the sands of barca or cyrene's torrid soil, levied to side with warring winds, and poise thir lighter wings. to whom these most adhere, hee rules a moment; chaos umpire sits, and by decision more imbroiles the fray by which he reigns: next him high arbiter chance governs all. into this wilde abyss, the womb of nature and perhaps her grave, of neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire, but all these in thir pregnant causes mixt confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight, unless th' almighty maker them ordain his dark materials to create more worlds, into this wild abyss the warie fiend stood on the brink of hell and look'd a while, pondering his voyage; for no narrow frith he had to cross. nor was his eare less peal'd with noises loud and ruinous (to compare great things with small) then when bellona storms, with all her battering engines bent to rase som capital city; or less then if this frame of heav'n were falling, and these elements in mutinie had from her axle torn the stedfast earth. at last his sail-broad vannes he spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a league as in a cloudy chair ascending rides audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets a vast vacuitie: all unawares fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour down had been falling, had not by ill chance the strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud instinct with fire and nitre hurried him as many miles aloft: that furie stay'd, quencht in a boggie syrtis, neither sea, nor good dry land: nigh founderd on he fares, treading the crude consistence, half on foot, half flying; behoves him now both oare and saile. as when a gryfon through the wilderness with winged course ore hill or moarie dale, pursues the arimaspian, who by stelth had from his wakeful custody purloind the guarded gold: so eagerly the fiend ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, with head, hands, wings or feet pursues his way, and swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes: at length a universal hubbub wilde of stunning sounds and voices all confus'd born through the hollow dark assaults his eare with loudest vehemence: thither he plyes, undaunted to meet there what ever power or spirit of the nethermost abyss might in that noise reside, of whom to ask which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes bordering on light; when strait behold the throne of chaos, and his dark pavilion spread wide on the wasteful deep; with him enthron'd sat sable-vested night, eldest of things, the consort of his reign; and by them stood orcus and ades, and the dreaded name of demogorgon; rumor next and chance, and tumult and confusion all imbroild, and discord with a thousand various mouths. t' whom satan turning boldly, thus. ye powers and spirits of this nethermost abyss, chaos and ancient night, i come no spy, with purpose to explore or to disturb the secrets of your realm, but by constraint wandring this darksome desart, as my way, lies through your spacious empire up to light, alone, and without guide, half lost, i seek what readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds confine with heav'n; or if som other place from your dominion won, th' ethereal king possesses lately, thither to arrive i travel this profound, direct my course; directed no mean recompence it brings to your behoof, if i that region lost, all usurpation thence expell'd, reduce to her original darkness and your sway (which is my present journey) and once more erect the standard there of ancient night; yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge. thus satan; and him thus the anarch old with faultring speech and visage incompos'd answer'd. i know thee, stranger, who thou art, that mighty leading angel, who of late made head against heav'ns king, though overthrown. i saw and heard, for such a numerous host fled not in silence through the frighted deep with ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, confusion worse confounded; and heav'n gates pourd out by millions her victorious bands pursuing. i upon my frontieres here keep residence; if all i can will serve, that little which is left so to defend, encroacht on still through our intestine broiles weakning the scepter of old night: first hell your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath; now lately heaven and earth, another world hung ore my realm, link'd in a golden chain to that side heav'n from whence your legions fell: if that way be your walk, you have not farr; so much the neerer danger; go and speed; havock and spoil and ruin are my gain. he ceas'd; and satan staid not to reply, but glad that now his sea should find a shore, with fresh alacritie and force renew'd springs upward like a pyramid of fire into the wilde expanse, and through the shock of fighting elements, on all sides round environ'd wins his way; harder beset and more endanger'd, then when argo pass'd through bosporus betwixt the justling rocks: or when ulysses on the larbord shunnd charybdis, and by th' other whirlpool steard. so he with difficulty and labour hard mov'd on, with difficulty and labour hee; but hee once past, soon after when man fell, strange alteration! sin and death amain following his track, such was the will of heav'n, pav'd after him a broad and beat'n way over the dark abyss, whose boiling gulf tamely endur'd a bridge of wondrous length from hell continu'd reaching th' utmost orbe of this frail world; by which the spirits perverse with easie intercourse pass to and fro to tempt or punish mortals, except whom god and good angels guard by special grace. but now at last the sacred influence of light appears, and from the walls of heav'n shoots farr into the bosom of dim night a glimmering dawn; here nature first begins her fardest verge, and chaos to retire as from her outmost works a brok'd foe with tumult less and with less hostile din, that satan with less toil, and now with ease wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light and like a weather-beaten vessel holds gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn; or in the emptier waste, resembling air, weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold farr off th' empyreal heav'n, extended wide in circuit, undetermind square or round, with opal towrs and battlements adorn'd of living saphire, once his native seat; and fast by hanging in a golden chain this pendant world, in bigness as a starr of smallest magnitude close by the moon. thither full fraught with mischievous revenge, accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies. <line>","religion,christianity,god & the divine"

remark, freud speculates <line> <line>that space is the projection of a “psychic apparatus” <line> <line>which remains almost entirely oblivious to itself; <line> <line>and wright extols “that primitive sense of shelter” <line> <line>which can turn a house into a refuge from despair. <line> <line>i wish that time could bring the future back again <line> <line>and let me see things as they used to seem to me <line> <line>before i found myself alone, in an emancipated state— <line> <line>alone and free and filled with cares about tomorrow. <line> <line>there used to be a logic in the way time passed <line> <line>that made it flow directly towards an underlying space <line> <line>where all the minor, individual lives converged. <line> <line>the moments borrowed their perceptions from the past <line> <line>and bathed the future in a soft, familiar light <line> <line>i remembered from home, and which has faded. <line> <line>and the voices get supplanted by the rain, <line> <line>the nights seem colder, and the angel in the mind <line> <line>that used to sing to me beneath the wide suburban sky <line> <line>turns into dreamwork and dissolves into the air, <line> <line>while in its place a kind of monument appears, <line> <line>magnificent in isolation, compromised by proximity <line> <line>and standing in a small and singular expanse— <line> <line>as though the years had been a pretext for reflection, <line> <line>and my life had been a phase of disenchantment— <line> <line>as the faces that i cherished gradually withdraw, <line> <line>the reassuring settings slowly melt away, <line> <line>and what remains is just a sense of getting older. <line> <line>in a variation of the parable, the pure of heart <line> <line>descend into a kingdom that they never wanted <line> <line>and refused to see. the homely notions of the good, <line> <line>the quaint ideas of perfection swept away like <line> <line>adolescent fictions as the real forms of life <line> <line>deteriorate with manically increasing speed, <line> <line>the kind man wakes into a quiet dream of shelter, <line> <line>and the serenity it brings—not in reflection, <line> <line>but in the paralyzing fear of being mistaken, <line> <line>of losing everything, of acquiescing in the <line> <line>obvious approach (the house shaped like a box; <line> <line>the life that can’t accommodate another’s)— <line> <line>as the heart shrinks down to tiny, local things. <line> <line> <line> <line>why can’t the more expansive ecstasies come true? <line> <line>i met you more than thirty years ago, in 1958, <line> <line>in mrs. wolford’s eighth grade history class. <line> <line>all moments weigh the same, and matter equally; <line> <line>yet those that time brings back create the fables <line> <line>of a happy or unsatisfying life, of minutes <line> <line>passing on the way to either peace or disappointment— <line> <line>like a paper calendar on which it’s always autumn <line> <line>and we’re back in school again; or a hazy afternoon <line> <line>near the beginning of october, with the world series <line> <line>playing quietly on the radio, and the windows open, <line> <line>and the california sunlight filling up the room. <line> <line>when i survey the mural stretched across the years <line> <line>—across my heart—i notice mostly small, neglected <line> <line>parts of no importance to the whole design, but which, <line> <line>in their obscurity, seem more permanent and real. <line> <line>i see the desks and auditorium, suffused with <line> <line>yellow light connoting earnestness and hope that <line> <line>still remains there, in a space pervaded by a <line> <line>soft and supple ache too deep to contemplate— <line> <line>as though the future weren’t real, and the present <line> <line>were amorphous, with nothing to hold on to, <line> <line>and the past were there forever. and the art <line> <line>that time inflicts upon its subjects can’t <line> <line>eradicate the lines sketched out in childhood, <line> <line>which harden into shapes as it recedes. <line> <line>i wish i knew a way of looking at the world <line> <line>that didn’t find it wanting, or of looking at my <line> <line>life that didn’t always see a half-completed <line> <line>structure made of years and filled with images <line> <line>and gestures emblematic of the past, like gatsby’s <line> <line>light, or proust’s imbalance on the stones. <line> <line>i wish there were a place where i could stay <line> <line>and leave the world alone—an enormous stadium <line> <line>where i could wander back and forth across a field <line> <line>replete with all the incidents and small details <line> <line>that gave the days their textures, that bound the <line> <line>minutes into something solid, and that linked them <line> <line>all together in a way that used to seem eternal. <line> <line>we used to go to dances in my family’s ancient <line> <line>cadillac, which blew up late one summer evening <line> <line>climbing up the hill outside del mar. and later <line> <line>i can see us steaming off the cover of the beatles’ <line> <line>baby-butcher album at your house in mission bay; <line> <line>and three years later listening to the velvet <line> <line>underground performing in a roller skating rink. <line> <line>years aren’t texts, or anything like texts; <line> <line>and yet i often think of 1968 that way, as though <line> <line>that single year contained the rhythms of the rest, <line> <line>as what began in hope and eagerness concluded in <line> <line>intractable confusion, as the wedding turned into a <line> <line>puzzling fiasco over poor john godfrey’s hair. <line> <line>the parts were real, and yet the dense and living <line> <line>whole they once composed seems broken now, its <line> <line>voice reduced to disembodied terms that speak to me <line> <line>more distantly each day, until the tangled years <line> <line>are finally drained of feeling, and collapse into a <line> <line>sequence of the places where we lived: your parents’ <line> <line>house in kensington, and mine above the canyon: <line> <line>then the flat by sears in cambridge, where we <line> <line>moved when we got married, and the third floor <line> <line>of the house on francis avenue, near harvard square; <line> <line>the big apartment in milwaukee where we lived the <line> <line>year that john was born, and last of all the <line> <line>house in whitefish bay, where you live now <line> <line>and all those years came inexplicably undone <line> <line>in mid-july. the sequence ended late last year. <line> <line>suppose we use a lifetime as a measure of the world <line> <line>as it exists for one. then half of mine has ended, <line> <line>while the fragment which has recently come to be <line> <line>contains no vantage point from which to see it whole. <line> <line>i think that people are the sum of their illusions, <line> <line>that the cares that make them difficult to see <line> <line>are eased by distance, with their errors blending <line> <line>in an intricate harmony, their truths abiding <line> <line>in a subtle “spark” or psyche (each incomparable, <line> <line>yet each the same as all the others) and their <line> <line>disparate careers all joined together in a tangled <line> <line>moral vision whose intense, meandering design <line> <line>seems lightened by a pure simplicity of feeling, <line> <line>as in grief, or in the pathos of a life <line> <line>cut off by loneliness, indifference or hate, <line> <line>because the most important thing is human happiness— <line> <line>not in the sense of private satisfactions, but of <line> <line>lives that realize themselves in ordinary terms <line> <line>and with the quiet inconsistencies that make them real. <line> <line>the whole transcends its tensions, like the intimate <line> <line>reflections on the day that came at evening, whose <line> <line>significance was usually overlooked, or misunderstood, <line> <line>because the facts were almost always unexceptional. <line> <line>two years ago we took our son to paris. last night <line> <line>i picked him up and took him to a lou reed show, <line> <line>and then took him home. i look at all the houses as i <line> <line>walk down hackett avenue to work. i teach my classes, <line> <line>visit friends, cook introspective meals for myself, <line> <line>yet in the end the minutes don’t add up. what’s lost <line> <line>is the perception of the world as something good <line> <line>and held in common; as a place to be perfected <line> <line>in the kinds of everyday divisions and encounters <line> <line>that endowed it with integrity and structure, <line> <line>and that merged its private moments with the past. <line> <line>what broke it into pieces? what transformed the <line> <line>flaws that gave it feeling into objects of a deep and <line> <line>smoldering resentment—like coming home too early, <line> <line>or walking too far ahead of you on the rue jacob? <line> <line>i wish that life could be a window on the sun, <line> <line>instead of just this porch where i can stand and <line> <line>contemplate the wires that lace the parking lot <line> <line>and feel it moving towards some unknown resolution. <line> <line>the guggenheim museum just reopened. tonight i <line> <line>watched a segment of the news on pbs—narrated by a <line> <line>woman we met years ago at bob’s—that showed how <line> <line>most of wright’s interior had been restored, <line> <line>and how the ramp ascends in spirals towards the sky. <line> <line>i like the houses better—they flow in all directions, <line> <line>merging with the scenery and embodying a milder, <line> <line>more domestic notion of perfection, on a human scale <line> <line>that doesn’t overwhelm the life that it encloses. <line> <line>isn’t there a way to feel at home within the <line> <line>confines of this bland, accommodating structure <line> <line>made of souvenirs and emblems, like the hammock <line> <line>hanging in the backyard of an undistinguished <line> <line>prairie school house in whitefish bay—the lineal, <line> <line>reduced descendant of the “flameproof” wright house <line> <line>just a block or two away from where i live now? <line> <line>i usually walk along the street on sunday, <line> <line>musing on how beautiful it seems, how aspects of it <line> <line>recapitulate the oak park house and studio, with <line> <line>open spaces buried in a labyrinthine interior, <line> <line>and with the entrance half-concealed on the side— <line> <line>a characteristic feature of his plans that made it <line> <line>difficult to find, although the hope was that in <line> <line>trying to get inside, the visitor’s eye would come to <line> <line>linger over subtleties he might have failed to see— <line> <line>in much the way that in the course of getting older, <line> <line>and trying to reconstruct the paths that led me here, <line> <line>i found myself pulled backwards through these old, <line> <line>uncertain passages, distracted by the details, <line> <line>and meeting only barriers to understanding why the <line> <line>years unfolded as they did, and why my life <line> <line>turned out the way it has—like his signature <line> <line>“pathway of discovery,” with each diversion <line> <line>adding to the integrity of the whole. <line> <line> <line> <line>there is this sweep life has that makes the <line> <line>accidents of time and place seem small. <line> <line>everything alters, and the personal concerns <line> <line>that love could hold together for a little while <line> <line>decay, and then the world seems strange again, <line> <line>and meaningless and free. i miss the primitive <line> <line>confusions, and the secret way things came to me <line> <line>each evening, and the pain. i still wonder <line> <line>where the tears went, standing in my room each day <line> <line>and quietly inhabiting a calm, suspended state <line> <line>enveloped by the emptiness that scares and thrills me, <line> <line>with the background noise cascading out of nothing <line> <line>like a song that makes the days go by, a song <line> <line>incorporating everything—not into what it says, <line> <line>but simply in the way it touches me, a single <line> <line>image of dispersal, the inexhaustible perception <line> <line>of contingency and transience and isolation. <line> <line>it brings them back to me. i have the inwardness <line> <line>i think i must have wanted, and the quietude, <line> <line>the solitary temper, and this space where i can <line> <line>linger with the silence curling all around me <line> <line>like the sound of pure passage, waiting here <line> <line>surrounded by the furniture, the books and lists <line> <line>and all these other emblems of the floating world, <line> <line>the prints of raindrops that begin as mist, that fall <line> <line>discreetly through the atmosphere, and disappear. <line> <line>and then i feel them in the air, in a reserved, <line> <line>more earthly music filled with voices reassembling <line> <line>in a wellspring of remembrance, talking to me again, <line> <line>and finding shelter in the same evasive movements <line> <line>i can feel in my own life, cloaked in a quiet <line> <line>dignity that keeps away the dread of getting old, <line> <line>and fading out of other people’s consciousness, <line> <line>and dying –with its deepest insecurities and fears <line> <line>concealed by their own protective colorations, <line> <line>as the mind secretes its shell and calls it home. <line> <line>it has the texture of an uncreated substance, <line> <line>hovering between the settings it had come to love <line> <line>and some unformulated state i can’t imagine— <line> <line>waiting for the telephone to ring, obsessed with <line> <line>ways to occupy these wide, unstructured hours, <line> <line>and playing records by myself, and waking up alone. <line> <line>all things are disparate, yet subject to the same <line> <line>intense, eradicating wills of time and personality, <line> <line>like waves demolishing the walls love seemed to build <line> <line>between our lives and emptiness, the certainty they <line> <line>seemed to have just two or three short years ago, <line> <line>before the anger spread its poison over everything. <line> <line>i think about the way our visions locked together <line> <line>in a nightmare play of nervousness and language, <line> <line>living day to day inside the concentrated <line> <line>force of that relentless argument, whose words <line> <line>swept over us in formless torrents of anxiety, two <line> <line>people clinging to their versions of their lives <line> <line>almost like children—living out each other’s <line> <line>intermittent fantasies, that fed upon themselves <line> <line>as though infected by some vile, concentrated hatred; <line> <line>who then woke up and planned that evening’s dinner. <line> <line>it’s all memories now, and distance. miles away <line> <line>the cat is sleeping on the driveway, john’s in school, <line> <line>and sunlight filters through a curtain in the kitchen. <line> <line>nothing really changes—the external world intrudes <line> <line>and then withdraws, and then becomes continuous again. <line> <line>i went downtown today and got a lamp with pendant <line> <line>lanterns made of opalescent art glass—part, i guess, <line> <line>of what this morning’s paper called the “wright craze.” <line> <line>i like the easy way the days go by, the parts of aging <line> <line>that have come to seem familiar, and the uneventful <line> <line>calm that seems to settle on the house at night. <line> <line>each morning brings the mirror’s reassuring face, <line> <line>as though the years had left the same enduring person <line> <line>simplified and changed—no longer vaguely desperate, <line> <line>no longer torn, yet still impatient with himself <line> <line>and still restless; but drained of intricacy and rage, <line> <line>like a mild paradox—uninteresting in its own right, <line> <line>yet existing for the sake of something stranger. <line> <line>now and then our life comes over me, in brief, <line> <line>involuntary glimpses of that world that blossom <line> <line>unexpectedly, in fleeting moments of regret <line> <line>that come before the ache, the pang that gathers <line> <line>sharply, like an indrawn breath—a strange and <line> <line>thoughtful kind of pain, as though a steel <line> <line>band had somehow snapped inside my heart. <line> <line>i don’t know. but what i do know is that <line> <line>none of it is ever going to come to me again. <line> <line>why did i think a person only distantly like me <line> <line>might finally represent my life? what aspects <line> <line>of my attitudes, my cast of mind, my inconclusive <line> <line>way of tossing questions at the world had i <line> <line>supposed might realize another person’s fantasies <line> <line>and turn her into someone else—who gradually became <line> <line>a separate part of me, and argued with the very <line> <line>words i would have used, and looked at me through <line> <line>eyes i’d looked at as though gazing at myself? <line> <line>i guess we only realize ourselves in dreams, <line> <line>or in these self-reflexive reveries sustaining <line> <line>all the charms that contemplation holds—until the <line> <line>long enchantment of the soul with what it sees <line> <line>is lifted, and it startles at a space alight with <line> <line>objects of its infantile gaze, like people in a mall. <line> <line>i saw her just the other day. i felt a kind of <line> <line>comfort at her face, one tinctured with bemusement <line> <line>at the strange and guarded person she’d become— <line> <line>attractive, vaguely friendly, brisk (too brisk), <line> <line>but no one i could think might represent my life. <line> <line>why did i even try to see myself in what’s outside? <line> <line>the strangeness pushes it away, propels the vision <line> <line>back upon itself, into these regions filled with <line> <line>shapes that i can wander through and never see, <line> <line>as though their image were inherently unreal. <line> <line>the houses on a street, the quiet backyard shade, <line> <line>the room restored to life with bric-a-brac— <line> <line>i started by revisiting these things, then slowly <line> <line>reconceiving them as forms of loss made visible <line> <line>that balanced sympathy and space inside an <line> <line>abstract edifice combining reaches of the past <line> <line>with all these speculations, all this artful <line> <line>preening of the heart. i sit here at my desk, <line> <line>perplexed and puzzled, teasing out a tangled <line> <line>skein of years we wove together, and trying to <line> <line>combine the fragments of those years into a poem. <line> <line>who cares if life—if someone’s actual life—is <line> <line>finally insignificant and small? there’s still a <line> <line>splendor in the way it flowers once and fades <line> <line>and leaves a carapace behind. there isn’t time to <line> <line>linger over why it happened, or attempt to make its <line> <line>mystery come to life again and last, like someone <line> <line>still embracing the confused perceptions of himself <line> <line>embedded in the past, as though eternity lay there— <line> <line>for heaven’s a delusion, and eternity is in the details, <line> <line>and this tiny, insubstantial life is all there is. <line> <line>—and that would be enough, but for the reoccurring <line> <line>dreams i often have of you. sometimes at night <line> <line>the banished unrealities return, as though a room <line> <line>suffused with light and poetry took shape around me. <line> <line>pictures line the walls. it’s early summer. <line> <line>somewhere in remembrance of things past, marcel, <line> <line>reflecting on his years with “albertine”—with x— <line> <line>suggests that love is just a consciousness of distance, <line> <line>of the separation of two lives in time and space. <line> <line>i think the same estrangement’s mirrored in each life, <line> <line>in how it seems both adequate and incomplete—part <line> <line>day-to-day existence, part imaginary construct <line> <line>beckoning at night, and sighing through my dreams <line> <line>like some disconsolate chimera, or the subject <line> <line>of a lonely, terrifying sadness; or the isolation <line> <line>of a quiet winter evening, when the house feels empty, <line> <line>and silence intervenes. but in the wonderful <line> <line>enclosure opening in my heart, i seem to recognize <line> <line>our voices lilting in the yard, inflected by the <line> <line>rhythms of a song whose words are seamless <line> <line>and whose lines are never-ending. i can almost <line> <line>see the contours of your face, and sense the <line> <line>presence of the trees, and reimagine all of us <line> <line>together in a deep, abiding happiness, as if the <line> <line>three of us inhabited a fragile, made-up world <line> <line>that seemed to be so permanent, so real. <line> <line>i have this fantasy: it’s early in the evening. <line> <line>you and i are sitting in the backyard, talking. <line> <line>friends arrive, then drinks and dinner, conversation… <line> <line> <line> <line>the lovely summer twilight lasts forever… <line> <line> <line> <line> what’s the use? <line> <line>what purpose do these speculations serve? what <line> <line>mild enchantments do these meditations leave? <line> <line>they’re just the murmurs of an age, of middle age, <line> <line>that help to pass the time that they retrieve <line> <line>before subsiding, leaving everything unchanged. <line> <line>each of us at times has felt the future fade, <line> <line>or seen the compass of his life diminished, <line> <line>or realized some tangible illusion was unreal. <line> <line>driving down to evanston last week, i suddenly <line> <line>remembered driving down that road eight years ago, <line> <line>so caught up in some story i’d just finished <line> <line>that i’d missed the way the countryside was changing— <line> <line>how in place of trees there now were office towers <line> <line>and theme parks, parts of a confusingly panoply of <line> <line>barns and discount malls transfiguring a landscape <line> <line>filled with high, receding clouds and rows of flimsy <line> <line>houses in what used to be a field. i thought of <line> <line>other people’s lives, and how impossible it seemed <line> <line>to grasp them on the model of my own—as little <line> <line>mirrors of infinity—or sense their forms of <line> <line>happiness, or in their minor personal upheavals <line> <line>feel the sweep of time reduced to human scale <line> <line>and see its abstract argument made visible. <line> <line>i thought of overarching dreams of plenitude— <line> <line>how life lacks shape until it’s given one by love, <line> <line>and how each soul is both a kingdom in itself <line> <line>and part of some incorporating whole that <line> <line>feels and has a face and lets it live forever. <line> <line>all of these seemed true, and cancelled one another, <line> <line>leaving just the feeling of an unseen presence <line> <line>tracing out the contours of a world erased, <line> <line>like music tracing out the contours of the mind—﻿ <line> <line>for life has the form of a winding curve in space <line> <line>and in its wake the human figure disappears. <line> <line>look at our surroundings—where a previous age <line> <line>could visualize a landscape we see borders, <line> <line>yet i think the underlying vision is the same: <line> <line>a person positing a world that he can see <line> <line>and can’t contain, and vexed by other people. <line> <line>everything is possible; some of it seemed real <line> <line>or nearly real, yet in the end it spoke to me alone, <line> <line>in phrases echoing the isolation of a meager <line> <line>ledge above a waterfall, or rolling across a vast, <line> <line>expanding plain on which there’s always room, <line> <line>but only room for one. it starts and ends <line> <line>inside an ordinary room, while in the interim <line> <line>brimming with illusions, filled with commonplace <line> <line>delights that make the days go by, with simple <line> <line>arguments and fears, and with the nervous <line> <line>inkling of some vague, utopian conceit <line> <line>transforming both the landscape and our lives, <line> <line>until we look around and find ourselves at home, <line> <line>but in a wholly different world. and even those <line> <line>catastrophes that seemed to alter everything <line> <line>seem fleeting, grounded in a natural order <line> <line>all of us are subject to, and ought to celebrate. <line> <line>—yet why? that things are temporary doesn’t <line> <line>render them unreal, unworthy of regretting. <line> <line>it’s not as though the past had never happened: <line> <line>all those years were real, and their loss was real, <line> <line>and it is sad—i don’t know what else to call it. <line> <line>i’m glad that both of us seem happy. yet what <line> <line>troubles me is just the way what used to be a world <line> <line>turned out, in retrospect, to be a state of mind, <line> <line>and no more tangible than that. and now it’s gone, <line> <line>and in its place i find the image of a process <line> <line>of inexorable decay, or of some great unraveling <line> <line>that drags the houses forward into emptiness <line> <line>and backwards into pictures of the intervening days <line> <line>love pieced together out of nothing. and i’m <line> <line>certain that this austere vision finally is true, <line> <line>and yet it strikes me as too meager to believe. <line> <line>it comes from much too high above the world <line> <line>and seems to me too hopeless, too extreme— <line> <line>but then i found myself one winter afternoon <line> <line>remembering a quiet morning in a classroom <line> <line>and inventing everything again, in ordinary <line> <line>terms that seemed to comprehend a

9603,6409,"<line> <line>i walked along rue du faubourg du temple on the way to belleville and i stopped at a shop selling rat poison. to my astonishment and my amusement they had a window full of stuffed rats, including four small rats standing round a table, playing cards. i liked that very much. paris was full of weird turnarounds, it seemed — poisoning and elevating the rats to art at the same time. i nearly went in and asked how much the four rats and the tiny table would cost, but i remembered i’d be going back to ireland pretty soon, and the people at airport security might not see the joke. <line> <line>it was not the first time i’d seen rat poison on sale here. paris seemed to have a problem with rats. someone i’d met for lunch recently had said she’d seen them running around the métro platform when she was coming home once around midnight. i remembered a rat had made a dramatic appearance in one of baudelaire’s little poems in prose. a rich boy had lost interest in his expensive toy because he’d seen a poor boy poking a rat in an improvised cage. i’m pretty sure that wasn’t an invention on baudelaire’s part — lots of poor parents probably thought of giving their children (or at least, their sons) rats as pets. hadn’t i had a pet mouse myself? the rich boy who’d seen the rat certainly was delighted at the idea of having the creature as a pet. <line> <line>many years ago a friend of mine who worked as a chef gave me his original copy of larousse gastronomique — an edition first published in the 1920s or 30s. in there, i think, was a recipe called cassoulet de grand souris. this was basically rat meat given the coq au vin or boeuf bourguignon treatment, i.e. cooked in red wine with mushrooms and tiny onions. i can’t remember which top parisian restaurant introduced the dish onto their menu during the siege of paris in 1870–71, but apparently it proved very popular. it made sense too, as the siege lasted for more than four months, and no meat was getting in, while rats were plentiful, then as now. i seem to recall the menus of the time sometimes also included rat salami, and a rat sauce called sauce robert. it’s no use looking in a current edition of larousse as the book has been cleaned up — all mention of rats have been removed. <line> <line>i had some experience of rats when i was a child in donegal. i commonly saw water rats swimming in the stream or small river that flowed behind my primary school. the house i grew up in had rats under the floorboards. i used to love spending time under the stairs, and sometimes the rats would come in through a hole in the back. i don’t remember ever having been afraid of them but i never touched them or wanted them to walk on top of me. and i certainly never thought of capturing one and making it my pet. my little pink-eyed albino mouse was rodent enough for me, and even that was a trial for my mother. <line>","activities,eating & drinking,relationships,pets,nature,animals,arts & sciences,poetry & poets,social commentaries,cities & urban life,history & politics"

9763,4868,"<line> <line>september is a month like any other and unlike any other. it seems in september everything awaited will arrive: in the calm air, in a particular scent, in the stillness of the quay. when september comes, i know i’m going to lose myself. the ants climbing my legs and a certain change of light tell me so. the air comes and goes beneath my dress, pressing the warm cloth against me, pressing me with the desire to find myself in the sea, that sea beaten deep gray and magnetized by neutrinos, thanks to which i can perform my observations and telekinetic communications. the salty, sticky wall of the malecón is covered with fish and forgotten hooks. i like to lick its sheen of salt and make my tongue salty and sticky. in that moment the rest of the city can vanish, it’s just that sea and me, before all thought, all desire. then i undress and enter, knowing i’ll find something, and that the boats—which seem suspended on the horizon, seem to have slipped their limits, motionless and painted there—are also mine...when i met you and you met me it was still september and we were strange and different and would be for a long time after—though i sometimes snagged you with certain secret hooks, shaping a sort of formless impression: something strange and indefinable divided the outline of your body from the space around you, but without making a human form, and in your eyes the sunlight revolved like a bicycle’s spoked wheel...the bicycle moves on and i’m carried along, filled with dry branches and coral. in my hair i wear the butterflies we collected together. the little house, one point amid the infinite, comes into view: already we can see the windows, like little black voids, and their curtains beating in the wind. i squeeze your waist, the bicycle moves on; even though the street is narrow the bicycle rolls on, rolls on against the spray. when you turn your head and see my hand, my hook snagged in a struggle of desire, the sun has turned immense in your eyes again. you make for the little house already in view, already at the edge of the curve...a naked man in lamplight is a magnificent animal: his pointy shoulders jut out and cut off the light. a line of fuzz descends from his navel to where the darkness begins, where the skin tightens like the skin of a fig. his body—your body—is an arc i want to tighten, to overcome, to conquer. hidden behind a tree, i can see your eyes again. the mississippi is a big river with many tributaries. the arc tightens and closes. i throw an arm over you, a leg, a hand, a lip, hallucinations, an ear—as usual. my body moves on. the mississippi is a big river with many tributaries. its water burns in my thighs, in the course of my dreams: the mississippi is a deep and torrential river situated in the united states, it is born in lake itasca, passes through st. paul, st. louis, memphis, new orleans, traverses 3,780 kilometers and slides and slides through a wide delta to the gulf of mexico. i’m in geography class. i like this class. the world just barely fits in my head. the map hangs before me with its spokes and points. someone made that all up, just to make me think i belong to one of those zones out there. all those castles and fortifications to toy with, the beginnings of everything that seems to be reality, but isn’t, because we’re not outside but inside the globe, that huge globe so stubborn in its sufficiency, and even far from the classroom nothing’s different: there’s just the idea of that transparent globe that is my image of the world, always turning, imperfect and constant inside me. i like the maps and the instability of the geography that situates places in my head. i like using graph paper to plot the latitudes and longitudes i can’t measure. i also like the geography professor, whose eyes i must constantly avoid in order not to drown myself. he doesn’t know, he can’t imagine, that while he lectures, while he looks at me, i draw fish in my notebook to throw in his river. the boy behind me won’t stop looking at me, and whatever one does the others all follow, watching from the corners of their eyes. that’s why i’m going to fold the page away from his gaze and make a true map where he won’t find me, alone at my desk in the middle of the world...in the middle of the lake there’s a boat and we’re three—although the third may have already vanished for us—and i want to paddle and sit in the center. you’ve taken off your shirt: the landscape appears and disappears. when i take the oars you want to teach me how to row over the edge. you try to teach me: you take my hands—you’re behind and above me. my fingers are lost in the middle of the boat. i’m wearing faded jeans and carrying a purple parasol. the oar descends toward the deep and tangles with seaweed. my hair hangs surly and limp on my wet shoulders. we try to steer but go nowhere. you explain the roundness of the earth;

9823,1534,"<line> <line>in order to upgrade the community’s appreciation of poetry during the international year of cultural enrichment stage 2, members of the state’s library progress committee decided to establish a small library of t-shirts on which would be printed quality verse in vivid, bold colours and lettering. the poems would be selected on the basis of one of three qualities: is the poem poignant, perspicacious, or pithy. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>given the respectably researched fact that the wearing of words on t-shirts expresses a deep psychic desire for an intimate union of word and flesh, (and bear in mind the way “logo” nudges towards “logos”) it is not surprising that this library of t-shirts has been a great success. no one seems to mind borrowing pre-worn clothing. of course the library’s washing and ironing staff maintain the t-shirts in excellent condition. even after ten borrowings the shirts look brand new. and considering the phenomenal success of andrew lloyd webber’s “cats” it is no shock revelation that t.s. eliot’s “hollow men” has proved to be the library’s most popular t-shirt so far. in fact there are now eight copies of this shirt on loan, most in metallic or fluoro colours. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>a couple of the more entrepreneurial of the library’s progress committee members are leading the push for diversification of the library’s poetry program, into neck to knee anti-uv swimwear, with maybe slessor, shelly and stevie smith prints for starters; and into underpants, with their multiple attractions. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>while the committee feels both these garments could increase poetry’s appeal, they are worried about the practicability of adding these garments to the t-shirt poetry collection. would many members want to borrow preworn underpants, however compelling the poems’ cadences and metaphors; while the wear and tear on the swimming costume fabric via chlorine and salt water would perhaps be too great. however they are interested in marketing and selling these articles from a stall in the library’s foyer. the only committee member unenthusiastic regarding this proposal is an optometrist who has raised the issue of eye damage if the typeface of the lines of verse on the underpants were too small. a solution in the form of large print haikus is being considered. <line>","arts & sciences,humor & satire,poetry & poets,social commentaries,popular culture"

eager to inspect my progress. <line> <line>then cecchino, my brother, two years younger than i <line> <line> <line> <line>and still beardless, died — <line> <line> <line> <line>was killed, as he tried to avenge the unjust killing of <line> <line>a comrade by the ruthless guard of the bargello. <line> <line> <line> <line>thus was stolen from him the chance to incise <line> <line> <line> <line>his presence into the hard, careless surface of the world. <line> <line>the fool who killed him <line> <line> <line> <line>in what justice must call self-defense <line> <line> <line> <line>later proved his nature by <line> <line>boasting of it. <line> <line> <line> <line>his boasting enraged, maddened me. in this <line> <line> <line> <line>great grief the pope rebuked me: you act as ifgrief can change death. <line> <line> <line> <line>sleepless, eatless, by day i worked at the pope’s <line> <line> <line> <line>absorbing golden button — and by night, hypnotized <line> <line>as a jealous lover, i watched and followed <line> <line> <line> <line>the fatuous creature who murdered my brother. <line> <line> <line> <line>at last, overcoming my repugnance to an enterprise <line> <line>not-quite-praiseworthy, i decided <line> <line> <line> <line>to end my torment. my dagger entered the juncture <line> <line> <line> <line>of the nape-bone and the neck <line> <line>so deep into the bone <line> <line> <line> <line>with all my strength i could not pull it out. <line> <line> <line> <line>i ran to the palace of duke alessandro — for those who <line> <line>pursued me knew me. the pope’s natural son, <line> <line> <line> <line>later he became duke of florence, before his murder <line> <line> <line> <line>by his own cousin lorenzino, whose too-familiar <line> <line>intimacies and pretensions to power <line> <line> <line> <line>he not only indulged but openly mocked. <line> <line> <line> <line>alessandro told me to stay indoors <line> <line>for eight days. for eight days i stayed indoors, working <line> <line> <line> <line>at the jewel the pope had set his heart on. <line> <line> <line> <line>for eight days the pope failed <line> <line>to summon me. then his chamberlain, saying that all was <line> <line> <line> <line>well if i minded my work and kept silent, ushered me <line> <line> <line> <line>into the presence. the pope cast so menacing <line> <line>a glance toward me i trembled. <line> <line> <line> <line>examining my work, his countenance cleared, <line> <line> <line> <line>saying that i had accomplished a vast amount <line> <line>in a short time. then he said, now that you are cured, benvenuto — change your life. <line> <line> <line> <line>i promised that i would. soon after this, i opened <line> <line>a fine shop, my first; and finished the jewel. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>as the knife descended (forgive me, o god of <line> <line>nature, but thus you have arranged it, —) <line> <line> <line> <line>to my fevered mind <line> <line>each moment was infinite, and mine. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>late one night, in farewell, michelangelo <line> <line>turning to me said, benvenuto, <line> <line> you deliver yourself into their hands. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> here i leapt here i leapt here i leapt here i leapt <line> <line>the shrilling cricket in the shrilling summer evening <line> <line> <line> <line>sings; as did my father in the sweet years <line> <line> <line> <line>he served the pleasure of the lords of florence <line> <line>as a piper, in the consort of pipers. <line> <line> <line> <line>imagine my father, no longer young, married, still <line> <line> <line> <line>childless, an engineer who designs bridges and <line> <line>battlements for the duke, but whose <line> <line> <line> <line>first love is music — the flute. he joined <line> <line> <line> <line>the duke’s consort of pipers. now his nights <line> <line>often are spent not bending over charts and plans <line> <line> <line> <line>but dazzled at the court of lorenzo, called the magnificent — <line> <line> <line> <line>the same lorenzo who once plucked michelangelo, still <line> <line>a boy, from among the horde of the merely-talented <line> <line> <line> <line>bending to copy the masters in the ducal palace. <line> <line> <line> <line>lorenzo, with his father’s consent, adopted <line> <line>the boy; fed him at his own table. <line> <line> <line> <line>imagine, tonight, the brief concert is over — <line> <line> <line> <line>the consort of pipers (respectable, honorable <line> <line>amateurs: small merchants, a banker, a scholar) <line> <line> <line> <line>mingle, slightly awed, with an ambassador, a cardinal . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>suddenly lorenzo is at my father’s ear: he stoodnot six inches from me. <line> <line> <line> <line>not six inches from my father’s ear lorenzo <line> <line> <line> <line>in a low voice as he begins to move through <line> <line>the crowd followed by his son piero <line> <line> <line> <line>(as now my father must struggle to follow) <line> <line> <line> <line>tells my father he has painfully and increasingly <line> <line>remarked that the flute has led my father to neglect <line> <line> <line> <line>his fine engineering talent and therefore my <line> <line> <line> <line>father will understand why piero and the duke <line> <line>must dismiss him from the consort of pipers. <line> <line> <line> <line>lorenzo, entering the private apartments, was gone. <line> <line> <line> <line>in later years, my father repeated to his <line> <line>children: he stood not six inches from me. <line> <line> <line> <line>it is a lie. it is a lie that the medici and you and i <line> <line> <line> <line>stand on the same earth. what the sane eye <line> <line>saw, was a lie: — <line> <line> <line> <line>two things alone cross the illimitable distance <line> <line> <line> <line>between the great and the rest of <line> <line>us, who serve them: — <line> <line> <line> <line>a knife; and art. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>the emblem of florence is the lion; therefore <line> <line>lions, caged but restless and living, centuries ago <line> <line> <line> <line>began to announce to the piazza della signoria <line> <line> <line> <line>this is the fearsome seat of the free <line> <line>government of the republic of florence. <line> <line> <line> <line>duke cosimo, hating the noise and smell, had them <line> <line> <line> <line>moved behind the palace. for years, i had known <line> <line>the old man who fed and tended the lions, — <line> <line> <line> <line>one day he humbly asked me if i could make a ring <line> <line> <line> <line>unlike all others for his daughter’s wedding. <line> <line>i said yes, of course; but, as payment for its <line> <line> <line> <line>rarity, i wanted him to drug the strongest lion <line> <line> <line> <line>asleep, so that i could <line> <line>examine, for my art, his body. <line> <line> <line> <line>he said he knew no art of drugging; such poison <line> <line> <line> <line>could kill the creature; a week later, <line> <line>in fury he said yes. <line> <line> <line> <line>the animal was numbed but not <line> <line> <line> <line>sleeping; he tried to raise <line> <line>his great head, as i lay lengthwise against his warm body; <line> <line> <line> <line>the head fell back. my head <line> <line> <line> <line>nestling behind his, each arm, outstretched, slowly <line> <line>descending along each leg, at last with both hands i <line> <line> <line> <line>pulled back the fur and touched a claw. <line> <line> <line> <line>this creature whose claw waking could kill me, — <line> <line>. . . i wore its skin. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>after the medici were returned from eighteen years’ <line> <line>banishment, placed over us again not by the will <line> <line> <line> <line>of florentines, but by a spanish army — <line> <line> <line> <line>my father, though during the republic he regained <line> <line>his position as piper, ever loyal to the medici <line> <line> <line> <line>wrote a poem celebrating his party’s victory <line> <line> <line> <line>and prophesying the imminent <line> <line>advent of a medici pope. then julius ii died; <line> <line> <line> <line>cardinal de’ medici, against expectation, was elected; <line> <line> <line> <line>the new pope wrote my father that he must <line> <line>come to rome and serve him. <line> <line> <line> <line>my father had no will to travel. then jacopo <line> <line> <line> <line>salviati, in power because married to a medici, <line> <line>took from my father his place at the duke’s new court; <line> <line> <line> <line>took from him his profit, his hope, his will. <line> <line> <line> <line>thus began that slow extinguishment <line> <line>of hope, the self ’s obsequies for the self <line> <line> <line> <line>at which effacement i felt not only a helpless <line> <line> <line> <line>witness, but <line> <line>cause, author. <line> <line> <line> <line>he said i was his heart. <line> <line> i had asked to be his heartbefore i knew what i was asking. <line> <line> <line> <line>against his mania to make me a musician <line> <line> <line> <line>at fifteen i put myself to the goldsmith’s trade; <line> <line>without money <line> <line> <line> <line>or position, he now could not oppose this. <line> <line> help the boy — for his father is poor <line> <line>rang in my ears as i began to sell <line> <line> <line> <line>the first trinkets i had made. later, to escape <line> <line> <line> <line>the plague then raging, he made me <line> <line>quickly leave florence; when i returned, <line> <line> <line> <line>he, my sister, her husband and child, were dead. <line> <line> <line> <line>these events, many occurring before my birth, i <line> <line>see because my father described them <line> <line> <line> <line>often and with outrage. <line> <line> <line> <line>to be a child is to see things and not <line> <line>know them; then you know them. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>despite the malicious <line> <line>stars, decisive at my birth: despite their <line> <line> <line> <line>sufficient instrument, the hand within me that moves against me: in the utter darkness of my first prison <line> <line>god granted me vision: <line> <line> <line> <line>surrounded by my stinks, an angel, his beauty <line> <line> <line> <line>austere, not wanton, graciously <line> <line>showed me a room in half-light crowded with the dead: <line> <line> <line> <line>postures blunted as if all promise of change <line> <line> <line> <line>was lost, the dead <line> <line>walked up and down and back and forth: <line> <line> <line> <line>as if the promise of change <line> <line> <line> <line>fleeing had stolen the light. <line> <line>then, on the wall, there was a square of light. <line> <line> <line> <line>careless of blindness i turned my eyes <line> <line> <line> <line>to the full sun. i did not care <line> <line>to look on anything again but this. the sun <line> <line> <line> <line>withering and quickening without distinction <line> <line> <line> <line>then bulged out: the boss <line> <line>expanded: the calm body of the dead christ <line> <line> <line> <line>formed itself from the same <line> <line> <line> <line>substance as the sun. still on the cross, <line> <line>he was the same substance as the sun. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>the bait the duke laid <line> <line>was perseus. perseus <line> <line> <line> <line>standing before the piazza della signoria. <line> <line> <line> <line>my statue’s audience and theater, michelangelo’sdavid; donatello’s <line> <line> judith with the head of holofernes . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>here the school of florence, swaggering, says <line> <line>to the world: eat. <line> <line> <line> <line>only bandinelli’s odious hercules and cacus <line> <line> <line> <line>reminds one that when one walks <line> <line>streets on earth one steps in shit. <line> <line> <line> <line>duke cosimo desired, he said, a statue of perseus <line> <line> <line> <line>triumphant, after intricate trials able <line> <line>at last to raise high <line> <line> <line> <line>medusa’s mutilated head — he imagined, <line> <line> <line> <line>perhaps, decapitation of the fickle <line> <line>rabble of republican florence . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>i conceived the hero’s gesture as more generous: — <line> <line> kill the thing that lookedupon makes us stone. <line> <line> <line> <line>soon enough, on my great bronze bust of the great <line> <line> <line> <line>duke, i placed — staring out from his chest — <line> <line>medusa, her head not yet cut, living. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> remember, benvenuto, you cannot bring yourgreat gifts to light by your strength alone you show your greatness only through the opportunities we give youhold your tongue i will drown you in gold <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>as we stared down at the vast square, atdavid, at judith — then at hercules and cacus <line> <line> <line> <line>approved and placed there by cosimo himself — <line> <line> <line> <line>from high on the fortress lookout of the palace, <line> <line>against whose severe façade so many <line> <line> <line> <line>human promises had been so cunningly <line> <line> <line> <line>or indifferently crushed, i told the duke that i <line> <line>cannot make his statue. my brief return from france <line> <line> <line> <line>was designed only to provide for the future of <line> <line> <line> <line>my sister and six nieces, now without husband <line> <line>or father. the king of france alone had saved me <line> <line> <line> <line>from the pope’s dungeon — not any lord of italy! <line> <line> <line> <line>at this, the duke looked at me <line> <line>sharply, but said nothing. <line> <line> <line> <line>all rome knew that though i had disproved <line> <line> <line> <line>the theft that was pretext for my arrest, pope paul <line> <line>still kept me imprisoned, out of spite — <line> <line> <line> <line>vengeance of his malignant son pier luigi, now <line> <line> <line> <line>assassinated by his own retainers. <line> <line>one night at dinner, the king’s emissary gave the pope <line> <line> <line> <line>gossip so delicious that out of merriment, and about to vomit <line> <line> <line> <line>from indulgence, he agreed <line> <line>to free me. i owed king francis <line> <line> <line> <line>my art, my service. the same stipend he once paid <line> <line> <line> <line>leonardo, he now paid me; along with a house in paris. <line> <line>this house was, in truth, a castle . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>i omitted, of course, quarrels with the king’s <line> <line> <line> <line>mistress, demon who taunted me for the slowness <line> <line>of my work, out of her petty hatred of art itself; <line> <line> <line> <line>omitted her insistence to the king that i <line> <line> <line> <line>am insolent and by example teach <line> <line>insolence to others. omitted that i overheard the king <line> <line> <line> <line>joke with her lieutenant: — <line> <line> kill him, if you can find mehis equal in art. <line> <line> <line> <line>before the school of florence i had only been able, <line> <line> <line> <line>young, to show myself as goldsmith <line> <line>and jeweler; not yet as sculptor. <line> <line> <line> <line>duke cosimo then announced that all the king of france <line> <line> <line> <line>had given me, he would surpass: boasting, <line> <line>he beckoned me to follow him past the public <line> <line> <line> <line>common galleries, into the private apartments . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>dutiful abashed puppet, i followed; i knew <line> <line>i would remain and make his statue. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> in the mirror of art, you who are familiar with the rituals ofdecorum and bloodshed before which you are silence and submission while within stonethe mind writhes <line> <line> contemplate, as if a refrain were wisdom, the glistening intricationof bronze and will and circumstance in the mirror of art. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>bandinelli for months insinuated in the duke’s ear <line> <line>perseus never would be finished: — <line> <line> <line> <line>i lacked the art, he said, to move from the small <line> <line> <line> <line>wax model the duke rightly praised, to lifesize <line> <line>bronze whose secrets tormented even donatello. <line> <line> <line> <line>so eighteen months after work began, duke cosimo grew <line> <line> <line> <line>tired, and withdrew his subsidy. lattanzo gorini, <line> <line>spider-handed and gnat-voiced, refusing to hand over <line> <line> <line> <line>payment said, why do you not finish? <line> <line> <line> <line>then bandinelli hissed sodomite! at <line> <line>me — after my enumeration, to the court’s <line> <line> <line> <line>amusement, of the sins against art and sense <line> <line> <line> <line>committed by his hercules and cacus, recital <line> <line>designed to kill either him or his authority . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>the duke, at the ugly word, frowned <line> <line> <line> <line>and turned away. i replied that the sculptor ofhercules and cacus must be a madman to think that i <line> <line> <line> <line>presumed to understand the art that jove in heaven <line> <line> <line> <line>used on ganymede, art nobly practiced here on earth <line> <line>by so many emperors and kings. my saucy speech <line> <line> <line> <line>ended: my poor wick does not dare to burn so high! <line> <line> <line> <line>duke and court broke into laughter. thus was <line> <line>born my resolve to murder bandinelli. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>i’d hurl the creature to hell. in despair at what must <line> <line>follow — the duke’s rage, abandonment of my <line> <line> <line> <line>never-to-be-born perseus — i cast <line> <line> <line> <line>myself away for lost: with a hundred crowns <line> <line>and a swift horse, i resolved first to bid <line> <line> <line> <line>farewell to my natural son, put to wet-nurse in fiesole; <line> <line> <line> <line>then to descend to san domenico, where bandinelli <line> <line>returned each evening. then, after blood, france. <line> <line> <line> <line>reaching fiesole, i saw the boy <line> <line> <line> <line>was in good health; his wet-nurse <line> <line>was my old familiar, old gossip, now <line> <line> <line> <line>married to one of my workmen. the boy <line> <line> <line> <line>clung to me: wonderful in a two-year-old, in <line> <line>grief he flailed his arms when at last <line> <line> <line> <line>in the thick half-dusk <line> <line> <line> <line>i began to disengage myself. entering the square <line> <line>of san domenico on one side, i saw my prey <line> <line> <line> <line>arriving on the other. enraged that he still <line> <line> <line> <line>drew breath, when i reached him <line> <line>i saw he was unarmed. he rode a small sorry <line> <line> <line> <line>mule. a wheezing donkey carried a ten-year-old <line> <line> <line> <line>boy at his side. in my sudden presence, his face <line> <line>went white. i nodded my head and rode past. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>i had a vision of bandinelli surrounded <line> <line>by the heaped-up works of his hand. <line> <line> not one thing that he had made did i want to have made. <line> <line>from somewhere within his body <line> <line> <line> <line>like a thread <line> <line> <line> <line>he spun the piles surrounding him. then he <line> <line>tried to pull away, to release the thread; i saw <line> <line> <line> <line>the thread was a leash. <line> <line> <line> <line>he tried and tried to cut it. <line> <line>at this, in my vision i said out-loud: — <line> <line> my art is my revenge. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>when i returned to florence from fiesole, after <line> <line>three days news was brought to me that my little boy <line> <line> <line> <line>was smothered by his wet-nurse <line> <line> <line> <line>turning over on him as they both slept. <line> <line>his panic, as i left; his arms raised, in panic. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> from the great unchosen narration you will soonbe released benvenuto cellini dirtied by blood and earthbut now <line> <line> you have again taught yourself to disappear moving wax from armto thigh you have again taught yourself to disappear here where each soul is itsorbit spinning sweetly around the center of itself at the edge of its eye the greatdesign of virtue here your medusa and your perseus are twins his triumphant body still furious with purposebut his face abstracted absorbed in contemplation as she is abstracted absorbedthough blood still spurts from her neck <line> <line> defeated by a mirror as in concentration you move waxfrom thigh to arm under your hand it grows <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>the idyll began when the duke reached me a goldsmith’s <line> <line>hammer, with which i struck the goldsmith’s <line> <line> <line> <line>chisel he held; and so the little statues were <line> <line> <line> <line>disengaged from earth and rust. bronze <line> <line>antiquities, newly found near arezzo, they lacked <line> <line> <line> <line>either head or hands or feet. impatient for my <line> <line> <line> <line>presence, the duke insisted that i join him each evening <line> <line>at his new pastime, playing artisan — leaving orders <line> <line> <line> <line>for my free admittance to his rooms, day or night. <line> <line> <line> <line>his four boys, when the duke’s eyes were turned, <line> <line>hovered around me, teasing. one night <line> <line> <line> <line>i begged them to hold their peace. <line> <line> <line> <line>the boldest replied, that we can’t do! i said <line> <line>what one cannot do is required of no one. <line> <line> so have your will! faced with their sons’ <line> <line> <line> <line>delight in this new principle, the duke and duchess <line> <line>smiling accused me of a taste for chaos . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>at last the four figures wrought for the four <line> <line> <line> <line>facets of the pedestal beneath perseus <line> <line>were finished. i brought them one evening to the duke, <line> <line> <line> <line>arranging them on his worktable in a row: — <line> <line> figures, postures from scenes that the eye cannotentirely decipher, story haunting the eye with its <line> <line> resonance, unseen ground that explains nothing . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>the duke appeared, then immediately <line> <line>retreated; reappearing, in his right hand <line> <line> <line> <line>he held a pear slip. this is for your garden, the garden of your house. i began, do you mean, but he cut me off <line> <line>saying, yes, benvenuto: garden and house now are yours. <line> <line> <line> <line>thus i received what earlier was only lent me. <line> <line> <line> <line>i thanked him and his duchess; then both <line> <line>took seats before my figures. <line> <line> <line> <line>for two hours talk was of their beauty, — <line> <line> <line> <line>the duchess insisted they were too exquisite <line> <line>to be wasted down there <line> <line> <line> <line>in the piazza; i must place them in her apartments. <line> <line> <line> <line>no argument from intention or design <line> <line>unconvinced her. <line> <line> <line> <line>so i waited till the next day — entering the private <line> <line> <line> <line>chambers at the hour the duke and duchess <line> <line>each afternoon went riding, i carried the statues <line> <line> <line> <line>down and soldered them with lead into their niches. <line> <line> <line> <line>returning, how angry the duchess became! the duke <line> <line>abandoned his workshop. i went there no more. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>the old inertia of earth that hates the new <line> <line>(as from a rim i watched) <line> <line> <line> <line>rose from the ground, legion: — <line> <line> <line> <line>truceless ministers of the great unerasable <line> <line>zero, eager to annihilate lineament and light, <line> <line> <line> <line>waited, pent, against the horizon: — <line> <line> <line> <line>some great force (massive, stubborn, multiform asearth, fury whose single name is legion, — ) <line> <line> <line> <line>wanted my perseus not to exist: — <line> <line> <line> <line>and i must <line> <line>defeat them. <line> <line> <line> <line>then my trembling assistants woke me. <line> <line> <line> <line>they said all my work <line> <line>was spoiled. <line> <line> <line> <line>perseus was spoiled. he lay buried in earth <line> <line> <line> <line>wreathed in fragile earthenware veins from the furnace <line> <line>above, veins through which he still <line> <line> <line> <line>waited to be filled with burning metal. <line> <line> <line> <line>the metal was curdled. as i slept, sick, <line> <line>the bronze had been allowed to cake, to curdle. <line> <line> <line> <line>feverish, made sick by my exertions for <line> <line> <line> <line>days, for months, i slept; while those charged <line> <line>with evenly feeding the furnace that i had so well <line> <line> <line> <line>prepared, larked — <line> <line> <line> <line>i thought, unwitting ministers of the gorgonmedusa herself. the furnace choked with caking, curdling <line> <line> <line> <line>metal that no art known to man could <line> <line> <line> <line>uncurdle, must be utterly dismantled — all <line> <line>who made it agreed this must destroy <line> <line> <line> <line>the fragile, thirsty mould of perseus beneath. <line> <line> <line> <line>but perseus was not more strong <line> <line>than medusa, but more clever: — if he ever <line> <line> <line> <line>was to exist as idea, he must first exist as matter: — <line> <line> <line> <line>all my old inborn <line> <line>daring returned, <line> <line> <line> <line>furious to reverse <line> <line> <line> <line>the unjust triumphs of the world’s mere <line> <line>arrangements of power, that seemingly on earth <line> <line> <line> <line>cannot be reversed. first, i surveyed my forces: — <line> <line> <line> <line>seven guilty workmen, timid, sullen, <line> <line>resentful; a groom; two maids; a cook. <line> <line> <line> <line>i harassed these skeptical troops into battle: — <line> <line> <line> <line>two hands were sent to fetch from the butcher <line> <line>capretta a load of young oak, — <line> <line> <line> <line>in bronze furnaces the only woods you use <line> <line> <line> <line>are slow-burning alder, willow, pine: now i needed <line> <line>oak and its fierce heat. as the oak <line> <line> <line> <line>was fed log by log into the fire, how the cake began <line> <line> <line> <line>to stir, to glow and sparkle. now <line> <line>from the increased <line> <line> <line> <line>combustion of the furnace, a conflagration <line> <line> <line> <line>shot up from the roof: two windows <line> <line>burst into flame: i saw the violent storm <line> <line> <line> <line>filling the sky fan the flames. <line> <line> <line> <line>all the while with pokers and iron rods <line> <line>we stirred and stirred the channels— <line> <line> <line> <line>the metal, bubbling, refused to flow. <line> <line> <line> <line>i sent for all my pewter plates, dishes, porringers — <line> <line>the cook and maids brought some two hundred. <line> <line> <line> <line>piece by piece, i had them thrown <line> <line> <line> <line>into the turgid mass. as i watched the metal for <line> <line>movement, the cap of the furnace <line> <line> <line> <line>exploded — bronze welling over on all sides. <line> <line> <line> <line>i had the plugs pulled, the mouths of the mould <line> <line>opened; in perfect liquefaction <line> <line> <line> <line>the veins of perseus filled . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>days later, when the bronze had cooled, when the clay <line> <line>sheath had been with great care removed, i found <line> <line> <line> <line>what was dead brought to life again. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>now, my second <line> <line>prison. it began soon after perseus was unveiled <line> <line> <line> <line>to acclaim — great acclaim. perhaps i grew <line> <line> <line> <line>too glorious. perseus, whose birth consumed <line> <line>nine years, found stuck to his pedestal <line> <line> <line> <line>sonnets celebrating the master’s hand that made him . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>on the day of unveiling, duke cosimo stationed himself <line> <line>at a window just above the entrance to the palace; <line> <line> <line> <line>there, half-hidden, he listened for hours to the crowd’s <line> <line> <line> <line>wonder. he sent his attendant sforza to say <line> <line>my reward <line> <line> <line> <line>soon would astonish me. <line> <line> <line> <line>ten days passed. at last sforza appeared and asked <line> <line>what price i placed on my statue. <line> <line> <line> <line>i was indeed astonished: it is not my custom, <line> <line> <line> <line>i replied, to set a price for my work, as ifhe were a merchant and i a mere tradesman. <line> <line> <line> <line>then, at risk of the duke’s severe displeasure, i was <line> <line> <line> <line>warned i must set a price: infuriated, i said <line> <line>ten thousand golden crowns. <line> <line> cities and great palaces are built with ten thousand golden crowns, the duke <line> <line>two days later flung at me in anger. <line> <line> many men can build cities and palaces, <line> <line> <line> <line>i replied, but not one can makea second perseus. <line> <line> <line> <line>bandinelli, consulted by the duke, reluctantly <line> <line> <line> <line>concluded that the statue was worth <line> <line>sixteen thousand. <line> <line> <line> <line>the duke replied that for two farthings <line> <line> <line> <line>perseus could go to the scrap heap; that would <line> <line>resolve our differences. <line> <line> <line> <line>at last, the settlement was thirty-five hundred, one <line> <line> <line> <line>hundred a month. soon after, charges were brought <line> <line>against me, for sodomy — <line> <line> <line> <line>i escaped florence as far as scarperia, but there <line> <line> <line> <line>the duke’s soldiers caught me and in chains <line> <line>brought me back. <line> <line> <line> <line>i confessed. if i had not, i could have been made <line> <line> <line> <line>to serve as a slave in the duke’s galleys for life. <line> <line>the duke listened behind a screen as i was made <line> <line> <line> <line>publicly to confess, in full court . . . punishment <line> <line> <line> <line>was four years imprisonment. without the duke’s <line> <line>concurrence, of course, no charges could have been <line> <line> <line> <line>lodged, no public humiliation arranged <line> <line> <line> <line>to silence the insolent. the first cosimo, founder of medicipower, all his life protected donatello — whose affections and bliss were found in ganymede. <line> <line> <line> <line>after imprisonment one month, cosimo <line> <line>finally commuted my sentence to house arrest. <line> <line> <line> <line>there his magnanimity allowed me to complete <line> <line> <line> <line>my christ of the whitest marble <line> <line>set upon a cross of the blackest. <line> <line> <line> <line>now, my christ sits still packed in a crate <line> <line> <line> <line>in the duke’s new chapel; my bust of the duke <line> <line>is exiled to elba, there to frighten in open air <line> <line> <line> <line>slaves peering out from his passing galleys. <line> <line> <line> <line>now, after the duchess and two of their sons <line> <line>died of fever within two months, cosimo <line> <line> <line> <line>grows stranger: he murdered sforza <line> <line> <line> <line>by running him through with a spear: — <line> <line>he does not own <line> <line> <line> <line>his mind; or will. <line> <line> <line> <line>when i ask release from his service, he says <line> <line>that he cannot, that he soon <line> <line> <line> <line>will have need of me for great projects; no <line> <line> <line> <line>commissions come. catherine de’ medici, regent of <line> <line>the young french king, petitioned that i be allowed <line> <line> <line> <line>to enter her service. he said i had no will now to work. <line> <line> <line> <line>in prison i wrote my sonnet addressed <line> <line>to fortune: — fortune, you sow! <line> <line> you turned from me because ganymede also is my joy . . . o god of nature, author <line> <line>of my nature, <line> <line> <line> <line>where does your son jesus forbid it? <line> <line> <line> <line>when i was five, one night my father <line> <line>woke me. he pulled me to the basement, making me <line> <line> <line> <line>stare into the oak fire and see what he just had seen. <line> <line> <line> <line>there a little lizard was sporting <line> <line>at the core of the intensest flames. <line> <line> <line> <line>my father boxed me on the ears, then kissed me — <line> <line> <line> <line>saying that i must remember this night: —my dear little boy, the lizard you see <line> <line> is a salamander, a creature that lives at the heart of fire. you and i are blessed: no othersoul now living has been allowed to see it. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>i am too old to fight to leave florence: — <line> <line> <line> <line>here, young, this goldsmith and jeweler <line> <line>began to imagine that <line> <line> <line> <line>severity, that chastity of style <line> <line> <line> <line>certain remnants of the ancient world <line> <line>left my hand hungry to emulate: — <line> <line> <line> <line>equilibrium of ferocious, contradictory <line> <line> <line> <line>forces: equilibrium whose balance or poise is their <line> <line>tension, and does not efface them, — <line> <line> <line> <line>as if the surface of each thing <line> <line> <line> <line>arranged within the frame, the surface of each <line> <line>body the eye must circle <line> <line> <line> <line>gives up to the eye its vibration, its nature. <line> <line> <line> <line>two or three times, perhaps,— yousay where, — i have achieved it. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>see, in my great bronze bust of the great <line> <line>duke, embedded in the right epaulette like a trophy <line> <line>an open-mouthed <line> <line>face part lion part man part goat, with an iron <line> <line>bar jammed in its lower jaw <line> <line> <line> <line>rising resistlessly across its mouth. <line> <line> <line> <line>see, in vasari’s clumsy portrait of me, as i float <line> <line>above the right shoulder of

i split a mangrove stick <line> <line>from a tree, and sharpened it. <line> <line> <line> <line>i covered the killing stick with orchid juice. <line> <line> <line> <line>we were camping at marunga island <line> <line>looking for oysters. this woman i was about to kill <line> <line> <line> <line>at last separated herself from the others <line> <line> <line> <line>to hunt lilies. she walked into the swamp, then <line> <line>got cold, and lay down on sandy ground. <line> <line> <line> <line>after i hit her between the eyes with my hatchet <line> <line> <line> <line>she kicked, but couldn’t <line> <line>raise up. <line> <line> <line> <line>with my thumb over the end of the killing stick <line> <line> <line> <line>i jabbed her mount of venus until her skin pushed <line> <line>back up to her navel. her large intestine <line> <line> <line> <line>protruded as though it were red calico. <line> <line> <line> <line>with my thumb over the end of the killing stick <line> <line>each time she inhaled <line> <line> <line> <line>i pushed my arm <line> <line> <line> <line>in a little. when she exhaled, i stopped. little by little <line> <line>i got my hand <line> <line> <line> <line>inside her. finally i touched her heart. <line> <line> <line> <line>once you reach what is <line> <line>inside it is outside. i pushed the killing stick <line> <line> <line> <line>into her heart. <line> <line> <line> <line>the spirit that belonged to that dead woman <line> <line>went into my heart then. <line> <line> <line> <line>i felt it go in. <line> <line> <line> <line>i pulled my arm <line> <line>out. i covered my arm with orchid juice. <line> <line> <line> <line>next i broke a nest of green ants <line> <line> <line> <line>off a tree, and watched the live ants <line> <line>bite her skin until her skin moved by itself <line> <line> <line> <line>downward from her navel and covered her bones. <line> <line> <line> <line>then i took some dry mud and put my sweat <line> <line>and her blood in the dry mud <line> <line> <line> <line>and warmed it over a fire. six or eight times <line> <line> <line> <line>i put the blood and sweat and mud <line> <line>inside her uterus until there was no trace of her <line> <line> <line> <line>wound or what i had done. <line> <line> <line> <line>i was careful none of her pubic hair was left <line> <line>inside her vagina for her husband to feel. <line> <line> <line> <line>her large intestine stuck out several feet. <line> <line> <line> <line>when i shook some green ants on it, a little <line> <line>went in. i shook some more. all of it went in. <line> <line> <line> <line>when i whirled the killing stick with her heart’s blood <line> <line> <line> <line>over her head, her head <line> <line>moved. when i whirled it some more, she moved <line> <line> <line> <line>more. the third time i whirled the killing stick <line> <line> <line> <line>she gasped for breath. she blew some breath <line> <line>out of her mouth, and was all right. <line> <line> <line> <line>i said, you go eat some lilies. she <line> <line> <line> <line>got up. i said, you will livetwo days. one day you will be happy. the next, sick. <line> <line> <line> <line>she ate some lilies. she walked around, then <line> <line> <line> <line>came back and slept. when laughing and talking women <line> <line>woke her she gathered her lilies and returned to camp. <line> <line> <line> <line>the next day she walked around and played, <line> <line> <line> <line>talked and made fun, gathering with others oysters <line> <line>and lilies. she brought into camp what

9881,7193,"<line> <line>of all the causes which conspire to blind man's erring judgment, and misguide the mind, what the weak head with strongest bias rules, is pride, the never-failing vice of fools. whatever nature has in worth denied, she gives in large recruits of needful pride; for as in bodies, thus in souls, we find what wants in blood and spirits, swell'd with wind; pride, where wit fails, steps in to our defence, and fills up all the mighty void of sense! if once right reason drives that cloud away, truth breaks upon us with resistless day; trust not yourself; but your defects to know, make use of ev'ry friend—and ev'ry foe. a little learning is a dang'rous thing; drink deep, or taste not the pierian spring: there shallow draughts intoxicate the brain, and drinking largely sobers us again. fir'd at first sight with what the muse imparts, in fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts, while from the bounded level of our mind, short views we take, nor see the lengths behind, but more advanc'd, behold with strange surprise new, distant scenes of endless science rise! so pleas'd at first, the tow'ring alps we try, mount o'er the vales, and seem to tread the sky; th' eternal snows appear already past, and the first clouds and mountains seem the last; but those attain'd, we tremble to survey the growing labours of the lengthen'd way, th' increasing prospect tires our wand'ring eyes, hills peep o'er hills, and alps on alps arise! a perfect judge will read each work of wit with the same spirit that its author writ, survey the whole, nor seek slight faults to find, where nature moves, and rapture warms the mind; nor lose, for that malignant dull delight, the gen'rous pleasure to be charm'd with wit. but in such lays as neither ebb, nor flow, correctly cold, and regularly low, that shunning faults, one quiet tenour keep; we cannot blame indeed—but we may sleep. in wit, as nature, what affects our hearts is not th' exactness of peculiar parts; 'tis not a lip, or eye, we beauty call, but the joint force and full result of all. thus when we view some well-proportion'd dome, (the world's just wonder, and ev'n thine, o rome!' no single parts unequally surprise; all comes united to th' admiring eyes; no monstrous height, or breadth, or length appear; the whole at once is bold, and regular. whoever thinks a faultless piece to see, thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er shall be. in ev'ry work regard the writer's end, since none can compass more than they intend; and if the means be just, the conduct true, applause, in spite of trivial faults, is due. as men of breeding, sometimes men of wit, t' avoid great errors, must the less commit: neglect the rules each verbal critic lays, for not to know such trifles, is a praise. most critics, fond of some subservient art, still make the whole depend upon a part: they talk of principles, but notions prize, and all to one lov'd folly sacrifice. once on a time, la mancha's knight, they say, a certain bard encount'ring on the way, discours'd in terms as just, with looks as sage, as e'er could dennis of the grecian stage; concluding all were desp'rate sots and fools, who durst depart from aristotle's rules. our author, happy in a judge so nice, produc'd his play, and begg'd the knight's advice, made him observe the subject and the plot, the manners, passions, unities, what not? all which, exact to rule, were brought about, were but a combat in the lists left out. ""what! leave the combat out?"" exclaims the knight; ""yes, or we must renounce the stagirite."" ""not so by heav'n"" (he answers in a rage) ""knights, squires, and steeds, must enter on the stage."" so vast a throng the stage can ne'er contain. ""then build a new, or act it in a plain."" thus critics, of less judgment than caprice, curious not knowing, not exact but nice, form short ideas; and offend in arts (as most in manners) by a love to parts. some to conceit alone their taste confine, and glitt'ring thoughts struck out at ev'ry line; pleas'd with a work where nothing's just or fit; one glaring chaos and wild heap of wit. poets, like painters, thus, unskill'd to trace the naked nature and the living grace, with gold and jewels cover ev'ry part, and hide with ornaments their want of art. true wit is nature to advantage dress'd, what oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd, something, whose truth convinc'd at sight we find, that gives us back the image of our mind. as shades more sweetly recommend the light, so modest plainness sets off sprightly wit. for works may have more wit than does 'em good, as bodies perish through excess of blood. others for language all their care express, and value books, as women men, for dress: their praise is still—""the style is excellent"": the sense, they humbly take upon content. words are like leaves; and where they most abound, much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found. false eloquence, like the prismatic glass, its gaudy colours spreads on ev'ry place; the face of nature we no more survey, all glares alike, without distinction gay: but true expression, like th' unchanging sun, clears, and improves whate'er it shines upon, it gilds all objects, but it alters none. expression is the dress of thought, and still appears more decent, as more suitable; a vile conceit in pompous words express'd, is like a clown in regal purple dress'd: for diff'rent styles with diff'rent subjects sort, as several garbs with country, town, and court. some by old words to fame have made pretence, ancients in phrase, mere moderns in their sense; such labour'd nothings, in so strange a style, amaze th' unlearn'd, and make the learned smile. unlucky, as fungoso in the play, these sparks with awkward vanity display what the fine gentleman wore yesterday! and but so mimic ancient wits at best, as apes our grandsires, in their doublets dress'd. in words, as fashions, the same rule will hold; alike fantastic, if too new, or old; be not the first by whom the new are tried, not yet the last to lay the old aside. but most by numbers judge a poet's song; and smooth or rough, with them is right or wrong: in the bright muse though thousand charms conspire, her voice is all these tuneful fools admire, who haunt parnassus but to please their ear, not mend their minds; as some to church repair, not for the doctrine, but the music there. these equal syllables alone require, tho' oft the ear the open vowels tire, while expletives their feeble aid do join, and ten low words oft creep in one dull line, while they ring round the same unvaried chimes, with sure returns of still expected rhymes. where'er you find ""the cooling western breeze"", in the next line, it ""whispers through the trees"": if ""crystal streams with pleasing murmurs creep"", the reader's threaten'd (not in vain) with ""sleep"". then, at the last and only couplet fraught with some unmeaning thing they call a thought, a needless alexandrine ends the song, that, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along. leave such to tune their own dull rhymes, and know what's roundly smooth, or languishingly slow; and praise the easy vigour of a line, where denham's strength, and waller's sweetness join. true ease in writing comes from art, not chance, as those move easiest who have learn'd to dance. 'tis not enough no harshness gives offence, the sound must seem an echo to the sense. soft is the strain when zephyr gently blows, and the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows; but when loud surges lash the sounding shore, the hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar. when ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw, the line too labours, and the words move slow; not so, when swift camilla scours the plain, flies o'er th' unbending corn, and skims along the main. hear how timotheus' varied lays surprise, and bid alternate passions fall and rise! while, at each change, the son of libyan jove now burns with glory, and then melts with love; now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow, now sighs steal out, and tears begin to flow: persians and greeks like turns of nature found, and the world's victor stood subdu'd by sound! the pow'r of music all our hearts allow, and what timotheus was, is dryden now. avoid extremes; and shun the fault of such, who still are pleas'd too little or too much. at ev'ry trifle scorn to take offence, that always shows great pride, or little sense; those heads, as stomachs, are not sure the best, which nauseate all, and nothing can digest. yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move, for fools admire, but men of sense approve; as things seem large which we through mists descry, dulness is ever apt to magnify. some foreign writers, some our own despise; the ancients only, or the moderns prize. thus wit, like faith, by each man is applied to one small sect, and all are damn'd beside. meanly they seek the blessing to confine, and force that sun but on a part to shine; which not alone the southern wit sublimes, but ripens spirits in cold northern climes; which from the first has shone on ages past, enlights the present, and shall warm the last; (though each may feel increases and decays, and see now clearer and now darker days.) regard not then if wit be old or new, but blame the false, and value still the true. some ne'er advance a judgment of their own, but catch the spreading notion of the town; they reason and conclude by precedent, and own stale nonsense which they ne'er invent. some judge of authors' names, not works, and then nor praise nor blame the writings, but the men. of all this servile herd, the worst is he that in proud dulness joins with quality, a constant critic at the great man's board, to fetch and carry nonsense for my lord. what woeful stuff this madrigal would be, in some starv'd hackney sonneteer, or me? but let a lord once own the happy lines, how the wit brightens! how the style refines! before his sacred name flies every fault, and each exalted stanza teems with thought! the vulgar thus through imitation err; as oft the learn'd by being singular; so much they scorn the crowd, that if the throng by chance go right, they purposely go wrong: so schismatics the plain believers quit, and are but damn'd for having too much wit. some praise at morning what they blame at night; but always think the last opinion right. a muse by these is like a mistress us'd, this hour she's idoliz'd, the next abus'd; while their weak heads, like towns unfortified, twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side. ask them the cause; they're wiser still, they say; and still tomorrow's wiser than today. we think our fathers fools, so wise we grow; our wiser sons, no doubt, will think us so. once school divines this zealous isle o'erspread; who knew most sentences, was deepest read; faith, gospel, all, seem'd made to be disputed, and none had sense enough to be confuted: scotists and thomists, now, in peace remain, amidst their kindred cobwebs in duck lane. if faith itself has different dresses worn, what wonder modes in wit should take their turn? oft, leaving what is natural and fit, the current folly proves the ready wit; and authors think their reputation safe which lives as long as fools are pleased to laugh. some valuing those of their own side or mind, still make themselves the measure of mankind; fondly we think we honour merit then, when we but praise ourselves in other men. parties in wit attend on those of state, and public faction doubles private hate. pride, malice, folly, against dryden rose, in various shapes of parsons, critics, beaus; but sense surviv'd, when merry jests were past; for rising merit will buoy up at last. might he return, and bless once more our eyes, new blackmores and new milbourns must arise; nay should great homer lift his awful head, zoilus again would start up from the dead. envy will merit, as its shade, pursue, but like a shadow, proves the substance true; for envied wit, like sol eclips'd, makes known th' opposing body's grossness, not its own. when first that sun too powerful beams displays, it draws up vapours which obscure its rays; but ev'n those clouds at last adorn its way, reflect new glories, and augment the day. be thou the first true merit to befriend; his praise is lost, who stays till all commend. short is the date, alas, of modern rhymes, and 'tis but just to let 'em live betimes. no longer now that golden age appears, when patriarch wits surviv'd a thousand years: now length of fame (our second life) is lost, and bare threescore is all ev'n that can boast; our sons their fathers' failing language see, and such as chaucer is, shall dryden be. so when the faithful pencil has design'd some bright idea of the master's mind, where a new world leaps out at his command, and ready nature waits upon his hand; when the ripe colours soften and unite, and sweetly melt into just shade and light; when mellowing years their full perfection give, and each bold figure just begins to live, the treacherous colours the fair art betray, and all the bright creation fades away! unhappy wit, like most mistaken things, atones not for that envy which it brings. in youth alone its empty praise we boast, but soon the short-liv'd vanity is lost: like some fair flow'r the early spring supplies, that gaily blooms, but ev'n in blooming dies. what is this wit, which must our cares employ? the owner's wife, that other men enjoy; then most our trouble still when most admir'd, and still the more we give, the more requir'd; whose fame with pains we guard, but lose with ease, sure some to vex, but never all to please; 'tis what the vicious fear, the virtuous shun; by fools 'tis hated, and by knaves undone! if wit so much from ign'rance undergo, ah let not learning too commence its foe! of old, those met rewards who could excel, and such were prais'd who but endeavour'd well: though triumphs were to gen'rals only due, crowns were reserv'd to grace the soldiers too. now, they who reach parnassus' lofty crown, employ their pains to spurn some others down; and while self-love each jealous writer rules, contending wits become the sport of fools: but still the worst with most regret commend, for each ill author is as bad a friend. to what base ends, and by what abject ways, are mortals urg'd through sacred lust of praise! ah ne'er so dire a thirst of glory boast, nor in the critic let the man be lost! good nature and good sense must ever join; to err is human; to forgive, divine. but if in noble minds some dregs remain, not yet purg'd off, of spleen and sour disdain, discharge that rage on more provoking crimes, nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times. no pardon vile obscenity should find, though wit and art conspire to move your mind; but dulness with obscenity must prove as shameful sure as impotence in love. in the fat age of pleasure, wealth, and ease, sprung the rank weed, and thriv'd with large increase: when love was all an easy monarch's care; seldom at council, never in a war: jilts ruled the state, and statesmen farces writ; nay wits had pensions, and young lords had wit: the fair sat panting at a courtier's play, and not a mask went unimprov'd away: the modest fan was lifted up no more, and virgins smil'd at what they blush'd before. the following licence of a foreign reign did all the dregs of bold socinus drain; then unbelieving priests reform'd the nation, and taught more pleasant methods of salvation; where heav'n's free subjects might their rights dispute, lest god himself should seem too absolute: pulpits their sacred satire learned to spare, and vice admired to find a flatt'rer there! encourag'd thus, wit's titans brav'd the skies, and the press groan'd with licenc'd blasphemies. these monsters, critics! with your darts engage, here point your thunder, and exhaust your rage! yet shun their fault, who, scandalously nice, will needs mistake an author into vice; all seems infected that th' infected spy, as all looks yellow to the jaundic'd eye. <line>","arts & sciences,philosophy,poetry & poets,reading & books,social commentaries"

<line> <line>my sister and i walk beside her. <line> <line>saying nothing. <line> <line>her hands wring the towel she carries with her. <line> <line>this towel, a multipurpose kind of thing. <line> <line>women carry it to fan themselves, <line> <line>to wipe sweat, to cover their heads and eyes from the sunlight, to shoo away kids, dogs, flies. <line> <line>i remember once a student of mine, out of habit, brought her towel with her to summer school at the university. <line> <line>whenever we see each other on campus during a summer session we always laugh about it. <line> <line>we continue to walk, stepping over the ends of rows of cotton. <line> <line>rows of cotton my family and i know well. <line> <line>in early summer we walk the rows to thin out the growth, <line> <line>and later we walk to chop the weeds somehow immune to chemicals. <line> <line>and in the winter, at least before the machinery, we pick the cotton from their stalks. <line> <line>now i can’t begin to imagine how many miles we have all walked, <line> <line>up and back, up and back along these rows. <line> <line>we walk alongside her. <line> <line>the setting sun maintains a continuous pounding on our backs, <line> <line>the humidity from the damp fields is warm, it rests on our shoulders like tired, sweaty arms. <line> <line>she heads toward the irrigation ditch. <line> <line>the ditch is dirt, not cement, it is wide, muddy, and slippery. <line> <line>the water is shallow. <line> <line>i see my father’s truck pulling up on the opposite side. <line> <line>in the front seat there are women, and in the back, men. <line> <line>the men wedge their feet in between plastic and aluminum irrigation pipes, mud-caked shovels, boots, and hoes. <line> <line>equipment in the back of his truck all for the purposes of working fields. <line> <line>i remember the hoe he carried. <line> <line>it was big, with a blade that held an edge well and got the work done. <line> <line>i recall purchasing a hoe for my home and being particularly unsatisfied with the craftsmanship. <line> <line>“they call this a hoe?” i said to my husband. it had a skinny neck, and no blade to speak of. <line> <line>the handle was too thin, causing blisters. <line> <line>once in awhile i look around for the type of hoe my father carried. i found one once, but didn’t have money to buy it. <line> <line>in slow motion, <line> <line>weighed down by the heat, <line> <line>the women begin to slide across the bench of the pickup truck. <line> <line>they slowly step out of the cab, appearing as a single long strand of woman,

opposite side. <line> <line>their movement is dreamlike. they peer into the muddy water. <line> <line>and as if with a shared nervous system, their hands motion the towel each is carrying, <line>

9967,13038,"<line> <line>so all day long the noise of battle roll'd among the mountains by the winter sea; until king arthur's table, man by man, had fallen in lyonnesse about their lord, king arthur: then, because his wound was deep, the bold sir bedivere uplifted him, sir bedivere, the last of all his knights, and bore him to a chapel nigh the field, a broken chancel with a broken cross, that stood on a dark strait of barren land. on one side lay the ocean, and on one lay a great water, and the moon was full. then spake king arthur to sir bedivere: ""the sequel of to-day unsolders all the goodliest fellowship of famous knights whereof this world holds record. such a sleep they sleep—the men i loved. i think that we shall never more, at any future time, delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds, walking about the gardens and the halls of camelot, as in the days that were. i perish by this people which i made,— tho' merlin sware that i should come again to rule once more—but let what will be, be, i am so deeply smitten thro' the helm that without help i cannot last till morn. thou therefore take my brand excalibur, which was my pride: for thou rememberest how in those old days, one summer noon, an arm rose up from out the bosom of the lake, clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, holding the sword—and how i row'd across and took it, and have worn it, like a king: and, wheresoever i am sung or told in aftertime, this also shall be known: but now delay not: take excalibur, and fling him far into the middle mere: watch what thou seëst, and lightly bring me word."" to him replied the bold sir bedivere: ""it is not meet, sir king, to leave thee thus, aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm. a little thing may harm a wounded man. yet i thy hest will all perform at full, watch what i see, and lightly bring thee word."" so saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept and in the moon athwart the place of tombs, where lay the mighty bones of ancient men, old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. he, stepping down by zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock, came on the shining levels of the lake. there drew he forth the brand excalibur, and o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon, brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth and sparkled keen with frost against the hilt: for all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks, myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth work of subtlest jewellery. he gazed so long that both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood, this way and that dividing the swift mind, in act to throw: but at the last it seem'd better to leave excalibur conceal'd there in the many-knotted water-flags, that whistled stiff and dry about the marge. so strode he back slow to the wounded king. then spake king arthur to sir bedivere: ""hast thou perform'd my mission which i gave? what is it thou hast seen, or what hast heard?"" and answer made the bold sir bedivere: ""i heard the ripple washing in the reeds, and the wild water lapping on the crag."" to whom replied king arthur, faint and pale: ""thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name, not rendering true answer, as beseem'd thy fealty, nor like a noble knight: for surer sign had follow'd, either hand, or voice, or else a motion of the mere. this is a shameful thing for men to lie. yet now, i charge thee, quickly go again as thou art lief and dear, and do the thing i bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word."" then went sir bedivere the second time across the ridge, and paced beside the mere, counting the dewy pebbles, fixed in thought; but when he saw the wonder of the hilt, how curiously and strangely chased, he smote his palms together, and he cried aloud, ""and if indeed i cast the brand away, surely a precious thing, one worthy note, should thus be lost forever from the earth, which might have pleased the eyes of many men. what good should follow this, if this were done? what harm, undone? deep harm to disobey, seeing obedience is the bond of rule. were it well to obey then, if a king demand an act unprofitable, against himself? the king is sick, and knows not what he does. what record, or what relic of my lord should be to aftertime, but empty breath and rumours of a doubt? but were this kept, stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings, some one might show it at a joust of arms, saying, 'king arthur's sword, excalibur, wrought by the lonely maiden of the lake; nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps upon the hidden bases of the hills.' so might some old man speak in the aftertime to all the people, winning reverence. but now much honour and much fame were lost."" so spake he, clouded with his own conceit, and hid excalibur the second time, and so strode back slow to the wounded king. then spoke king arthur, breathing heavily: ""what is it thou hast seen, or what hast heard?"" and answer made the bold sir bedivere: ""i heard the water lapping on the crag, and the long ripple washing in the reeds."" to whom replied king arthur, much in wrath: ""ah, miserable and unkind, untrue, unknightly, traitor-hearted! woe is me! authority forgets a dying king, laid widow'd of the power in his eye that bow'd the will. i see thee what thou art, for thou, the latest-left of all my knights, in whom should meet the offices of all, thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt; either from lust of gold, or like a girl valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes. yet, for a man may fail in duty twice, and the third time may prosper, get thee hence: but, if thou spare to fling excalibur, i will arise and slay thee with my hands."" then quickly rose sir bedivere, and ran, and, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged among the bulrush-beds, and clutch'd the sword, and strongly wheel'd and threw it. the great brand made lightnings in the splendour of the moon, and flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch, shot like a streamer of the northern morn, seen where the moving isles of winter shock by night, with noises of the northern sea. so flash'd and fell the brand excalibur: but ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, and caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him three times, and drew him under in the mere. and lightly went the other to the king. then spoke king arthur, drawing thicker breath: ""now see i by thine eyes that this is done. speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?"" and answer made the bold sir bedivere: ""sir king, i closed mine eyelids, lest the gems should blind my purpose, for i never saw, nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till i die, not tho' i live three lives of mortal men, so great a miracle as yonder hilt. then with both hands i flung him, wheeling him; but when i look'd again, behold an arm, clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, that caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him three times, and drew him under in the mere."" and answer made king arthur, breathing hard: ""my end draws nigh; 't is time that i were gone. make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight, and bear me to the margin; yet i fear my wound hath taken cold, and i shall die."" so saying, from the pavement he half rose, slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm, and looking wistfully with wide blue eyes as in a picture. him sir bedivere remorsefully regarded thro' his tears, and would have spoken, but he found not words, then took with care, and kneeling on one knee, o'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands, and rising bore him thro' the place of tombs. but, as he walk'd, king arthur panted hard, like one that feels a nightmare on his bed when all the house is mute. so sigh'd the king muttering and murmuring at his ear, ""quick, quick! i fear it is too late, and i shall die."" but the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge, clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk'd larger than human on the frozen hills. he heard the deep behind him, and a cry before. his own thought drove him like a goad. dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves and barren chasms, and all to left and right the bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based his feet on juts of slippery crag that rang sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels— and on a sudden, lo! the level lake, and the long glories of the winter moon. then saw they how there hove a dusky barge dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern, beneath them; and descending they were ware that all the decks were dense with stately forms black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream—by these three queens with crowns of gold—and from them rose a cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars, and, as it were one voice, an agony of lamentation, like a wind, that shrills all night in a waste land, where no one comes, or hath come, since the making of the world. then murmur'd arthur, ""place me in the barge,"" and to the barge they came. there those three queens put forth their hands, and took the king, and wept. but she that rose the tallest of them all and fairest, laid his head upon her lap, and loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his hands, and call'd him by his name, complaining loud and dropping bitter tears against his brow striped with dark blood: for all his face was white and colourless, and like the wither'd moon smote by the fresh beam of the springing east; and all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops of onset; and the light and lustrous curls— that made his forehead like a rising sun high from the daïs-throne—were parch'd with dust; or, clotted into points and hanging loose, mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips. so like a shatter'd column lay the king; not like that arthur who, with lance in rest, from spur to plume a star of tournament, shot thro' the lists at camelot, and charged before the eyes of ladies and of kings. then loudly cried the bold sir bedivere: ""ah! my lord arthur, whither shall i go? where shall i hide my forehead and my eyes? for now i see the true old times are dead, when every morning brought a noble chance, and every chance brought out a noble knight. such times have been not since the light that led the holy elders with the gift of myrrh. but now the whole round table is dissolved which was an image of the mighty world; and i, the last, go forth companionless, and the days darken round me, and the years, among new men, strange faces, other minds."" and slowly answer'd arthur from the barge: ""the old order changeth, yielding place to new, and god fulfils himself in many ways, lest one good custom should corrupt the world. comfort thyself: what comfort is in me? i have lived my life, and that which i have done may he within himself make pure! but thou, if thou shouldst never see my face again, pray for my soul. more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of. wherefore, let thy voice rise like a fountain for me night and day. for what are men better than sheep or goats that nourish a blind life within the brain, if, knowing god, they lift not hands of prayer both for themselves and those who call them friend? for so the whole round earth is every way bound by gold chains about the feet of god. but now farewell. i am going a long way with these thou seëst—if indeed i go— (for all my mind is clouded with a doubt) to the island-valley of avilion; where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow, nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard-lawns and bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea, where i will heal me of my grievous wound."" so said he, and the barge with oar and sail moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan that, fluting a wild carol ere her death, ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood with swarthy webs. long stood sir bedivere revolving many memories, till the hull look'd one black dot against the verge of dawn, and on the mere the wailing died away. <line>","living,death,sorrow & grieving,mythology & folklore,fairy-tales & legends"

<line>thee at the ferry oxford riders blithe, <line> <line> returning home on summer-nights, have met <line> <line> crossing the stripling thames at bab-lock-hithe, <line> <line> trailing in the cool stream thy fingers wet, <line> <line> as the punt's rope chops round; <line>and leaning backward in a pensive dream, <line> <line> and fostering in thy lap a heap of flowers <line> <line> pluck'd in shy fields and distant wychwood bowers, <line>and thine eyes resting on the moonlit stream. <line>and then they land, and thou art seen no more!— <line>maidens, who from the distant hamlets come <line> <line> to dance around the fyfield elm in may, <line>oft through the darkening fields have seen thee roam, <line> <line> or cross a stile into the public way. <line> <line> oft thou hast given them store <line>of flowers—the frail-leaf'd, white anemony, <line> <line> dark bluebells drench'd with dews of summer eves, <line> <line> and purple orchises with spotted leaves— <line>but none hath words she can report of thee. <line>and, above godstow bridge, when hay-time's here <line>in june, and many a scythe in sunshine flames, <line> <line> men who through those wide fields of breezy grass <line>where black-wing'd swallows haunt the glittering thames, <line> <line> to bathe in the abandon'd lasher pass, <line> <line> have often pass'd thee near <line>sitting upon the river bank o'ergrown; <line> <line> mark'd thine outlandish garb, thy figure spare, <line> <line> thy dark vague eyes, and soft abstracted air— <line>but, when they came from bathing, thou wast gone! <line>at some lone homestead in the cumner hills, <line>where at her open door the housewife darns, <line> <line> thou hast been seen, or hanging on a gate <line>to watch the threshers in the mossy barns. <line> <line> children, who early range these slopes and late <line> <line> for cresses from the rills, <line>have known thee eyeing, all an april-day, <line> <line> the springing pasture and the feeding kine; <line> <line> and mark'd thee, when the stars come out and shine, <line>through the long dewy grass move slow away. <line>in autumn, on the skirts of bagley wood— <line>where most the gipsies by the turf-edged way <line> <line> pitch their smoked tents, and every bush you see <line>with scarlet patches tagg'd and shreds of grey, <line> <line> above the forest-ground called thessaly— <line> <line> the blackbird, picking food, <line>sees thee, nor stops his meal, nor fears at all; <line> <line> so often has he known thee past him stray, <line> <line> rapt, twirling in thy hand a wither'd spray, <line>and waiting for the spark from heaven to fall. <line>and once, in winter, on the causeway chill <line>where home through flooded fields foot-travellers go, <line> <line> have i not pass'd thee on the wooden bridge, <line>wrapt in thy cloak and battling with the snow, <line> <line> thy face tow'rd hinksey and its wintry ridge? <line> <line> and thou has climb'd the hill, <line>and gain'd the white brow of the cumner range; <line> <line> turn'd once to watch, while thick the snowflakes fall, <line> <line> the line of festal light in christ-church hall— <line>then sought thy straw in some sequester'd grange. <line>but what—i dream! two hundred years are flown <line>since first thy story ran through oxford halls, <line> <line> and the grave glanvil did the tale inscribe <line>that thou wert wander'd from the studious walls <line> <line> to learn strange arts, and join a gipsy-tribe; <line> <line> and thou from earth art gone <line>long since, and in some quiet churchyard laid— <line> <line> some country-nook, where o'er thy unknown grave <line> <line> tall grasses and white flowering nettles wave, <line>under a dark, red-fruited yew-tree's shade. <line>—no, no, thou hast not felt the lapse of hours! <line>for what wears out the life of mortal men? <line> <line> 'tis that from change to change their being rolls; <line>'tis that repeated shocks, again, again, <line> <line> exhaust the energy of strongest souls <line> <line> and numb the elastic powers. <line>till having used our nerves with bliss and teen, <line> <line> and tired upon a thousand schemes our wit, <line> <line> to the just-pausing genius we remit <line>our worn-out life, and are—what we have been. <line>thou hast not lived, why should'st thou perish, so? <line>thou hadst one aim, one business, one desire; <line> <line> else wert thou long since number'd with the dead! <line>else hadst thou spent, like other men, thy fire! <line> <line> the generations of thy peers are fled, <line> <line> and we ourselves shall go; <line>but thou possessest an immortal lot, <line> <line> and we imagine thee exempt from age <line> <line> and living as thou liv'st on glanvil's page, <line>because thou hadst—what we, alas! have not. <line>for early didst thou leave the world, with powers <line>fresh, undiverted to the world without, <line> <line> firm to their mark, not spent on other things; <line>free from the sick fatigue, the languid doubt, <line> <line> which much to have tried, in much been baffled, brings. <line> <line> o life unlike to ours! <line>who fluctuate idly without term or scope, <line> <line> of whom each strives, nor knows for what he strives, <line> <line> and each half lives a hundred different lives; <line>who wait like thee, but not, like thee, in hope. <line>thou waitest for the spark from heaven! and we, <line>light half-believers of our casual creeds, <line> <line> who never deeply felt, nor clearly will'd, <line>whose insight never has borne fruit in deeds, <line> <line> whose vague resolves never have been fulfill'd; <line> <line> for whom each year we see <line>breeds new beginnings, disappointments new; <line> <line> who hesitate and falter life away, <line> <line> and lose to-morrow the ground won to-day— <line>ah! do not we, wanderer! await it too? <line>yes, we await it!—but it still delays, <line>and then we suffer! and amongst us one, <line> <line> who most has suffer'd, takes dejectedly <line>his seat upon the intellectual throne; <line> <line> and all his store of sad experience he <line> <line> lays bare of wretched days; <line>tells us his misery's birth and growth and signs, <line> <line> and how the dying spark of hope was fed, <line> <line> and how the breast was soothed, and how the head, <line>and all his hourly varied anodynes. <line>this for our wisest! and we others pine, <line>and wish the long unhappy dream would end, <line> <line> and waive all claim to bliss, and try to bear; <line>with close-lipp'd patience for our only friend, <line> <line> sad patience, too near neighbour to despair— <line> <line> but none has hope like thine! <line>thou through the fields and through the woods dost stray, <line> <line> roaming the country-side, a truant boy, <line> <line> nursing thy project in unclouded joy, <line>and every doubt long blown by time away. <line>o born in days when wits were fresh and clear, <line>and life ran gaily as the sparkling thames; <line> <line> before this strange disease of modern life, <line>with its sick hurry, its divided aims, <line> <line> its heads o'ertax'd, its palsied hearts, was rife— <line> <line> fly hence, our contact fear! <line>still fly, plunge deeper in the bowering wood! <line> <line> averse, as dido did with gesture stern <line> <line> from her false friend's approach in hades turn, <line>wave us away, and keep thy solitude! <line>still nursing the unconquerable hope, <line>still clutching the inviolable shade, <line> <line> with a free, onward impulse brushing through, <line>by night, the silver'd branches of the glade— <line> <line> far on the forest-skirts, where none pursue, <line> <line> on some mild pastoral slope <line>emerge, and resting on the moonlit pales <line> <line> freshen thy flowers as in former years <line> <line> with dew, or listen with enchanted ears, <line>from the dark tingles, to the nightingales! <line>but fly our paths, our feverish contact fly! <line>for strong the infection of our mental strife, <line> <line> which, though it gives no bliss, yet spoils for rest; <line>and we should win thee from thy own fair life, <line> <line> like us distracted, and like us unblest. <line> <line> soon, soon thy cheer would die, <line>thy hopes grow timorous, and unfix'd thy powers, <line> <line> and thy clear aims be cross and shifting made; <line> <line> and then thy glad perennial youth would fade, <line>fade and grow old at last, and die like ours. <line>then fly our greetings, fly our speech and smiles! <line>—as some grave tyrian trader, from the sea, <line> <line> descried at sunrise an emerging prow <line>lifting the cool-hair'd creepers stealthily, <line> <line> the fringes of a southward-facing brow <line> <line> among the ægæan isles; <line>and saw the merry grecian coaster come, <line> <line> freighted with amber grapes, and chian wine, <line> <line> green, bursting figs, and tunnies steep'd in brine— <line>and knew the intruders on his ancient home, <line>the young light-hearted masters of the waves— <line>and snatch'd his rudder, and shook out more sail; <line> <line> and day and night held on indignantly <line>o'er the blue midland waters with the gale, <line> <line> betwixt the syrtes and soft sicily, <line> <line> to where the atlantic raves <line>outside the western straits; and unbent sails <line> <line> there, where down cloudy cliffs, through sheets of foam, <line> <line> shy traffickers, the dark iberians come; <line>and on the beach undid his corded bales. <line> <line>","living,disappointment & failure,growing old,time & brevity,activities,school & learning,travels & journeys,nature,landscapes & pastorals,seas, rivers, & streams,trees & flowers,philosophy"

frets doubt the maw-crammed beast? rejoice we are allied to that which doth provide and not partake, effect and not receive! a spark disturbs our clod; nearer we hold of god who gives, than of his tribes that take, i must believe. then, welcome each rebuff that turns earth's smoothness rough, each sting that bids nor sit nor stand but go! be our joys three-parts pain! strive, and hold cheap the strain; learn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe! for thence,—a paradox which comforts while it mocks,— shall life succeed in that it seems to fail: what i aspired to be, and was not, comforts me: a brute i might have been, but would not sink i' the scale. what is he but a brute whose flesh has soul to suit, whose spirit works lest arms and legs want play? to man, propose this test— thy body at its best, how far can that project thy soul on its lone way? yet gifts should prove their use: i own the past profuse of power each side, perfection every turn: eyes, ears took in their dole, brain treasured up the whole; should not the heart beat once ""how good to live and learn?"" not once beat ""praise be thine! i see the whole design, i, who saw power, see now love perfect too: perfect i call thy plan: thanks that i was a man! maker, remake, complete,—i trust what thou shalt do!"" for pleasant is this flesh; our soul, in its rose-mesh pulled ever to the earth, still yearns for rest; would we some prize might hold to match those manifold possessions of the brute,—gain most, as we did best! let us not always say, ""spite of this flesh to-day i strove, made head, gained ground upon the whole!"" as the bird wings and sings, let us cry ""all good things are ours, nor soul helps flesh more, now, than flesh helps soul!"" therefore i summon age to grant youth's heritage, life's struggle having so far reached its term: thence shall i pass, approved a man, for aye removed from the developed brute; a god though in the germ. and i shall thereupon take rest, ere i be gone once more on my adventure brave and new: fearless and unperplexed, when i wage battle next, what weapons to select, what armour to indue. youth ended, i shall try my gain or loss thereby; leave the fire ashes, what survives is gold: and i shall weigh the same, give life its praise or blame: young, all lay in dispute; i shall know, being old. for note, when evening shuts, a certain moment cuts the deed off, calls the glory from the grey: a whisper from the west shoots—""add this to the rest, take it and try its worth: here dies another day."" so, still within this life, though lifted o'er its strife, let me discern, compare, pronounce at last, this rage was right i' the main, that acquiescence vain: the future i may face now i have proved the past."" for more is not reserved to man, with soul just nerved to act to-morrow what he learns to-day: here, work enough to watch the master work, and catch hints of the proper craft, tricks of the tool's true play. as it was better, youth should strive, through acts uncouth, toward making, than repose on aught found made: so, better, age, exempt from strife, should know, than tempt further. thou waitedst age: wait death nor be afraid! enough now, if the right and good and infinite be named here, as thou callest thy hand thine own with knowledge absolute, subject to no dispute from fools that crowded youth, nor let thee feel alone. be there, for once and all, severed great minds from small, announced to each his station in the past! was i, the world arraigned, were they, my soul disdained, right? let age speak the truth and give us peace at last! now, who shall arbitrate? ten men love what i hate, shun what i follow, slight what i receive; ten, who in ears and eyes match me: we all surmise, they this thing, and i that: whom shall my soul believe? not on the vulgar mass called ""work,"" must sentence pass, things done, that took the eye and had the price; o'er which, from level stand, the low world laid its hand, found straightway to its mind, could value in a trice: but all, the world's coarse thumb and finger failed to plumb, so passed in making up the main account; all instincts immature, all purposes unsure, that weighed not as his work, yet swelled the man's amount: thoughts hardly to be packed into a narrow act, fancies that broke through language and escaped; all i could never be, all, men ignored in me, this, i was worth to god, whose wheel the pitcher shaped. ay, note that potter's wheel, that metaphor! and feel why time spins fast, why passive lies our clay,— thou, to whom fools propound, when the wine makes its round, ""since life fleets, all is change; the past gone, seize to-day!"" fool! all that is, at all, lasts ever, past recall; earth changes, but thy soul and god stand sure: what entered into thee, that was, is, and shall be: time's wheel runs back or stops: potter and clay endure. he fixed thee mid this dance of plastic circumstance, this present, thou, forsooth, wouldst fain arrest: machinery just meant to give thy soul its bent, try thee and turn thee forth, sufficiently impressed. what though the earlier grooves, which ran the laughing loves around thy base, no longer pause and press? what though, about thy rim, skull-things in order grim grow out, in graver mood, obey the sterner stress? look not thou down but up! to uses of a cup, the festal board, lamp's flash and trumpet's peal, the new wine's foaming flow, the master's lips a-glow! thou, heaven's consummate cup, what need'st thou with earth's wheel? but i need, now as then, thee, god, who mouldest men; and since, not even while the whirl was worst, did i,—to the wheel of life with shapes and colours rife, bound dizzily,—mistake my end, to slake thy thirst: so, take and use thy work: amend what flaws may lurk, what strain o' the stuff, what warpings past the aim! my times be in thy hand! perfect the cup as planned! let age approve of youth, and death complete the same! <line>","living,growing old,time & brevity,religion,judaism,philosophy,engagement,weddings"

<line> <line>2. wide <line> <line>the “wide” is always haunted by surprise. in a dark world, the “wide” is the sudden door that opens on unfurling blackness, the void pooling at the bottom of the unlit stairs. to be bounded is our usual condition; to be open is anomalous, even excessive. <line> <line> <line> <line>a wide-eyed girl is extreme in her unliddedness, her bare membranes flinching at any contact, vulnerable to motes, to smuts, to dryness. a wide-hipped girl extends the splayed arches of her body to bridge the generational divide. a wide-legged girl unseals a portal between persons; she is disturbing to the extent that she is open to all comers, a trapdoor that must be shut for safety’s sake. a wide-eyed girl is often thought desirable; a wide-hipped girl is often thought eligible; a wide-legged girl is often thought deplorable. a wide-legged girl is rarely wide-eyed, though she may have started out that way. <line> <line> <line> <line>we can understand why milton, in the narrowing orbit of his blindness, would have considered wideness, unboundedness to be threatening. what’s less clear is why the wideness of the wide-legged girl is also considered threatening. does the wideness of the wide-legged girl evoke a kind of blindness, a dark room where one might blunder into strangers, the way two men once met each other in me? <line> <line>3. hide <line> <line>“but why hide it in a hole?” asks the master, returning from his long absence, sparks of bewilderment flaring into rage. <line> <line> <line> <line>an unanswered question worries at the parable of the talents: why is the master so terribly angry? it is not as if the servant had stolen the money, or spent it—his sin is one of omission, of overly risk-averse investing. a talent was a unit of weight in ancient greece: in monetary terms, it was worth eighty pounds of silver, or 6,000 denarii—nearly twenty years’ wages for the average worker. but milton uses the word in its more modern sense, dating from the fifteenth century: a natural ability or skill. <line> <line> <line> <line>how did a word for a deadweight of metal come to mean something inborn, innate? confusion between the inorganic and the natural trickles into the parable and the poem. the master prides himself on being a man who reaps where he has not sown and gathers where he did not scatter seed. was the servant’s fault to confuse coins for seeds, did he think he was planting when he was merely burying, did he mistake for viable what had no chance of living, what had never been alive? <line> <line>4. bent <line> <line>and what about the hole, which for so long had held treasure? did it wonder why — despite all the moistness and richness it could muster — those cold, glinting seeds never sprouted? did it understand that, if released into the wider world, the coins could have quickened, multiplied? that instead of an incubator, the hole had become an oubliette, a place where otherwise fruitful things were sent to languish, to become lodged, useless? <line> <line> <line> <line>“useless” — a word like a capped lead pipe, like the extra bone in my foot i will never pass down to my daughter. <line> <line> <line> <line>a thing becomes useless if it is bent out of shape. to “get bent” is to be put to another kind of use, a use my therapist considered tantamount to rape. to bend is to be bound, to bow down without breaking, with perhaps just the head tilted at an angle so as to peer upward. <line> <line>5. present <line> <line>the master has become the maker. the servile body wholly “his,” splayed wide in a welcome-home, bound up in a beribboned bow. <line> <line> <line> <line>but the reader will object. this is all wrong. first of all, in the sonnet, “bent” doesn’t mean to bow down as if in submission to an outside force, but instead denotes an innate or internalized tendency or inclination. second, a “present” is not a gift, but a verb meaning to offer openly, full-faced, the sun beaming down on a clean page. third, the body never comes into it at all. <line> <line>“therewith” — a safe word, a strongbox to be buried.6. chide <line> <line>is a “true account” a story or a sum? is the maker an audience or an auditor? <line> <line> <line> <line>the page scoured white by little grains of fear. <line> <line> <line> <line>a story has an ending. a sum has a bottom line. there was no accounting for me because my allotment leaked out of me, month after month, i scrubbed the sheets as if effacing the marks of a crime. <line> <line> <line> <line>then one day the fear reversed itself. like a photo negative but in higher contrast—its whites more glaring and its darks more glossy, as if a whisper-thin suspicion had come unzipped. <line> <line> <line> <line>“chide” is an enormous understatement. the servant isn’t merely scolded, he is cast into “the outer darkness” where there is “weeping and gnashing of teeth.” if the “outer darkness” is deemed to be a punishment, then does that lustrous inner darkness count as a reward? <line> <line>7. denied <line> <line>it seems unfair, is milton’s point. to be assigned a task, but not provided sufficient materials to complete it, is to be placed in a situation of contrived scarcity, like a lab rat or like the youngest sister in a fairy tale. <line> <line> <line> <line>the parable of the wise and foolish virgins—which prefaces the parable of the talents — centers on this scarcity. the virgins wait for the bridegroom, to greet him with lamps alight. five virgins have brought extra flasks of oil, but five virgins have let their lamps burn out and must go lampless into the night to look for oil. that much we are told, but questions hover around the shadowed margins of the story. why isn’t the bridegroom with the bride? why is he so delayed? why is the bridegroom met in the middle of the night by a phalanx of lamp-bearing virgins, like a troupe of pom-pom girls or like a sacrificial rite? <line> <line> <line> <line>the virginity of the virgins renders them piquant, memorable. adorning gothic portals, evoking thresholds, entrances, they are a particular feature of french cathedrals—much more so, one suspects, than if the parable had called them “maidservants” or even “bridesmaids.” <line> <line> <line> <line>the presumed desideratum of the story does not interest us much: the sated bridegroom at the midnight feast, the smug, unctuous faces of the wise virgins. instead, the imagination pursues the foolish virgins rushing into the night, their desperation making them vulnerable, their vulnerability making them erotic, the fill-holes of their useless lamps dark and slick with oil. is this how i was taught to sexualize insufficiency, the lack that set me wandering night after night, my body too early emptied out? <line> <line>8. prevent <line> <line>“prevent” — a word like a white sheet folded back to cover the mouth. <line> <line> <line> <line>a white egg bursts from the ovary and falls away, leaving a star-shaped scar. corpus albicans, the whitening body. such starbursts, at first, are scattered constellations, frost embroidering a dark field. but at what point does this white lacework shift over from intricacy to impossibility, opacity, obstacle—the ice disc clogging the round pond, the grid of proteins baffling the eye? <line> <line> <line> <line>“prevent” — a word that slams shut, a portcullis (latin: cataracta). <line> <line> <line> <line>letter to leonard philaras, september 28, 1654: “the dimness which i experience by night and day, seems to incline more to white than to black.” <line> <line>9. need <line> <line>has patience been looming in the background all along, silent, so as not to intrude upon a blind man’s consciousness? patience, whose garment is “white and close-fitting so that it is not blown about or disturbed by the wind.” <line> <line> <line> <line>at the turn of the sonnet, patience pries open its sculpted lips, its stiff tongue like a weaver’s shuttle drawing woolly strands through the warp and weft of milton’s blindness, a white monologue that admits neither interruption nor rejoinder. <line> <line> <line> <line>milton’s little murmur stitched back into his mouth. <line> <line> <line> <line>woven tight enough to repel need — a liquid beading on the surface, the blood the needles drew from me week after week, hundreds of stoppered vials consigned to the biohazard bin, en route to the incinerator. <line> <line> <line> <line>“need,” from the high german, for danger. <line> <line> <line> <line>“murmur,” from the sanskrit, a crackling fire. <line> <line>10. best <line> <line>the best beam in contentment, ranging themselves in rows. erect as test tubes but forswearing undue pride in such uprightness, mustering shoulder-to-shoulder with the fellow-elect. the best arrayed in regimental ranks, in refrigerated racks, white hymn of the unneeded, white hum of the unneeding. <line> <line> <line> <line>“best,” originally superlative of bot (old english: remedy, reparation). <line> <line> <line> <line>the best affect a pious pose, mouths held taut in tongueless os. sotto voce chorus of that soft, subjunctive song: if you were complete ... if you were replete ... <line> <line> <line> <line>superlative. the most remediated. the most repaired. <line> <line>11. state <line> <line>to be scooped out, emptied of need and rinsed clean of its greasy smears, pristine as a petri dish on a stainless lab table. enucleated, the white of the egg awaiting an unknown yolk. <line> <line> <line> <line>“yolk” from geolu (old english: yellow). not to be confused with “yoke” from geocian (old english: to be joined together). a yoke is an implement, meant to be used, to fill a need. but where there is no field to be plowed, no wagon to be pulled, why demand a yoke that is useless, needless? <line> <line> <line> <line>one day the romans sent for cincinnatus to lead the republic against the invading aequian army. he laid down his plow in the field and went to war. when the aequians surrendered, cincinnatus spared their lives but decreed that they must “pass under the yoke.” the romans fashioned a yoke from three spears, two fixed in the ground, and one tied across the tops of the two verticals. since the horizontal spear was only a few feet off the ground, the aequians were made to crouch down like animals in order to complete the surrender. this is thought to be the origin of the word “subjugate,” to be brought under the yoke. to bear a yoke is to be bowed down, oxbowed, cowed. <line> <line> <line> <line>one day they laid me down on a gurney, my feet strapped in stirrups, my legs bent and splayed like the horns of a white bull. <line> <line>12. speed <line> <line>but why would milton, of all people, use the word “kingly” as a compliment? roundheaded milton, who wrote tract after tract in defense of regicide, who would later be detained for opposing the restoration? <line> <line> <line> <line>at this point, our suspicions are confirmed: milton has disappeared entirely from the poem. we haven’t heard from him since the turn of the sonnet. we’ve been lulled by the cadenced voice of patience, its dusty tongue self-lubricating, its pallid breath clouding the room, precipitating frangible chains of hydrocarbons, their branchings barbed like fluffs of eiderdown. through the faint reticulations, we discern no dark stoop-shouldered figure, but only white-robed forms, upright as if hung from hooks, their faces unyielding as lanterns, shuttered as if once aflame. <line> <line>13. rest <line> <line>rest — a word like a gauze bandage, a ropy weave of collagen knitting its way across a wound. outspread as if fingered, gelid gestures suggesting solace: to stanch, to shield, to seal, to shut off. <line> <line> <line> <line>rest — the rind of the best, a contoured pod that cradles the shape of what it doesn’t hold. <line> <line> <line> <line>rest — those who are left when thousands have sped away, the bereft, who litter the land, with husks for hands, vacant-eyed, vacant faces raised like basins under a contrail-scarred sky. <line> <line>14. wait <line> <line>to stand and wait is a task far weightier than simply to wait. it is to permit the distractible body neither ease nor action, nor food nor drink nor any such reprieve; it is to pit the body in enmity against its own heaviness. <line> <line> <line> <line>to abide in readiness as in a winter orchard, the lacerated land bandaged in snow. to exist inert as if limbless, skin seamless as if reknit over what had been pruned away, knotted rootstock fit for no other service: no branch, no leaf, no fruit. to persist as a stripped stick persists in a white field, bark peeled back from one exposed split, uptilted as if eager for the grafted slip. <line> <line> <line> <line>to stand and wait for the one who reaps where he has not sown. <line> <line> <line> <line>mercy sugars the starving soil with nitrogen, potassium, phosphate. mercy captures rain in silver beads and stitches them through the threadbare weave of cloud. mercy wields a scalpel cutting a cleft in the lopped-off stump, mercy forces home the rootless wand, mercy seals the join with tar and tape. <line> <line> <line> <line>to foster the raw scion as if it were a son, to siphon light down through its body as if it were your own. <line>","living,the body,arts & sciences,poetry & poets,social commentaries,gender & sexuality,history & politics"

neighborhood residents came to regard the place as a kind of memorial & it was like this every other afternoon, you know, from june through the final days leading up to the book drives & raucous

steal & trade on the 4 train, not the red rock planet or lord of war — but was now in his everyday mode, seated on the stoop, a seer with so few words for devotees & passersby, each eventually stopped asking for his backstory, for his praise or functional wisdom, & instead were content to let him eat his veggie patty with cheese without interruption, which he did, which he was, when the din that always accompanies someone’s son’s public pummeling rang out, cut through our scene lengthwise, compelled the boy, for the first time on record, to leap from the steps of the brownstone his nana died

its doors. before they were caught in the scuffle, released ten to twenty rounds of ammo into the crowd without warning, bullets glancing off of cutlass doors & corner store glass built for battle, all but three or four of which entered the boy mid-stride, lifted his six-foot frame from the ground, legs still pumping. for a second, you would almost swear he was running through the gunfire, preparing for liftoff or something, baby cousin held firmly in his arms, shielded from the onslaught. they never would have caught him if he hadn’t been holding that child, said no one, though we all thought it during the weeks following that moment we each froze, the moment his body collapsed slow as petals upon the unremarkable cement, & we stared at our champion felled by an outcome so common

nor could the muse defend her son. so fail not thou, who thee implores: for thou are heav'nlie, shee an emptie dreame. say goddess, what ensu'd when raphael, the affable arch-angel, had forewarn'd adam by dire example to beware apostasie, by what befell in heaven to those apostates, least the like befall in paradise to adam or his race, charg'd not to touch the interdicted tree, if they transgress, and slight that sole command, so easily obeyd amid the choice of all tastes else to please thir appetite, though wandring. he with his consorted eve the storie heard attentive, and was fill'd with admiration, and deep muse to hear of things so high and strange, things to thir thought so unimaginable as hate in heav'n, and warr so neer the peace of god in bliss with such confusion: but the evil soon driv'n back redounded as a flood on those from whom it sprung, impossible to mix with blessedness. whence adam soon repeal'd the doubts that in his heart arose: and now led on, yet sinless, with desire to know what neerer might concern him, how this world of heav'n and earth conspicious first began, when, and whereof created, for what cause, what within eden or without was done before his memorie, as one whose drouth yet scarce allay'd still eyes the current streame, whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites, proceeded thus to ask his heav'nly guest. great things, and full of wonder in our eares, farr differing from this world, thou hast reveal'd divine interpreter, by favour sent down from the empyrean to forewarne us timely of what might else have bin our loss, unknown, which human knowledg could not reach: for which to the infinitly good we owe immortal thanks, and his admonishment receave with solemne purpose to observe immutably his sovran will, the end of what we are. but since thou hast voutsaf't gently for our instruction to impart things above earthly thought, which yet concernd our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd, deign to descend now lower, and relate what may no less perhaps availe us known, how first began this heav'n which we behold distant so high, with moving fires adornd innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills all space, the ambient aire wide interfus'd imbracing round this florid earth, what cause mov'd the creator in his holy rest through all eternitie so late to build in chaos, and the work begun, how soon absolv'd, if unforbid thou maist unfould what wee, not to explore the secrets aske of his eternal empire, but the more to magnifie his works, the more we know. and the great light of day yet wants to run much of his race though steep, suspens in heav'n held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares, and longer will delay to heare thee tell his generation, and the rising birth of nature from the unapparent deep: or if the starr of eevning and the moon haste to thy audience, night with her will bring silence, and sleep listning to thee will watch, or we can bid his absence, till thy song end, and dismiss thee ere the morning shine. thus adam his illustrious guest besought: and thus the godlike angel answerd milde. this also thy request with caution askt obtaine: though to recount almightie works what words or tongue of seraph can suffice, or heart of man suffice to comprehend? yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve to glorifie the maker, and inferr thee also happier, shall not be withheld thy hearing, such commission from above i have receav'd, to answer thy desire of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain to ask, nor let thine own inventions hope things not reveal'd, which th' invisible king, onely omniscient, hath supprest in night, to none communicable in earth or heaven: anough is left besides to search and know. but knowledge is as food, and needs no less her temperance over appetite, to know in measure what the mind may well contain, oppresses else with surfet, and soon turns wisdom to folly, as nourishment to winde. know then, that after lucifer from heav'n (so call him, brighter once amidst the host of angels, then that starr the starrs among) fell with his flaming legions through the deep into his place, and the great son returnd victorious with his saints, th' omnipotent eternal father from his throne beheld thir multitude, and to his son thus spake. at least our envious foe hath fail'd, who thought all like himself rebellious, by whose aid this inaccessible high strength, the seat of deitie supream, us dispossest, he trusted to have seis'd, and into fraud drew many, whom thir place knows here no more; yet farr the greater part have kept, i see, thir station, heav'n yet populous retaines number sufficient to possess her realmes though wide, and this high temple to frequent with ministeries due and solemn rites: but least his heart exalt him in the harme already done, to have dispeopl'd heav'n my damage fondly deem'd, i can repaire that detriment, if such it be to lose self-lost, and in a moment will create another world, out of one man a race of men innumerable, there to dwell, not here, till by degrees of merit rais'd they open to themselves at length the way up hither, under long obedience tri'd, and earth be chang'd to heav'n, & heav'n to earth, one kingdom, joy and union without end. mean while inhabit laxe, ye powers of heav'n, and thou my word, begotten son, by thee this i perform, speak thou, and be it don: my overshadowing spirit and might with thee i send along, ride forth, and bid the deep within appointed bounds be heav'n and earth, boundless the deep, because i am who fill infinitude, nor vacuous the space. though i uncircumscrib'd my self retire, and put not forth my goodness, which is free to act or not, necessitie and chance approach not mee, and what i will is fate. so spake th' almightie, and to what he spake his word, the filial godhead, gave effect. immediate are the acts of god, more swift then time or motion, but to human ears cannot without process of speech be told, so told as earthly notion can receave. great triumph and rejoycing was in heav'n when such was heard declar'd the almightie's will; glorie they sung to the most high, good will to future men, and in thir dwellings peace: glorie to him whose just avenging ire had driven out th' ungodly from his sight and th' habitations of the just; to him glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain'd good out of evil to create, in stead of spirits maligne a better race to bring into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse his good to worlds and ages infinite. so sang the hierarchies: mean while the son on his great expedition now appeer'd, girt with omnipotence, with radiance crown'd of majestie divine, sapience and love immense, and all his father in him shon. about his chariot numberless were pour'd cherub and seraph, potentates and thrones, and vertues, winged spirits, and chariots wing'd, from the armoury of god, where stand of old myriads between two brazen mountains lodg'd against a solemn day, harnest at hand, celestial equipage; and now came forth spontaneous, for within them spirit livd, attendant on thir lord: heav'n op'nd wide her ever during gates, harmonious sound on golden hinges moving, to let forth the king of glorie in his powerful word and spirit coming to create new worlds. on heav'nly ground they stood, and from the shore they view'd the vast immeasurable abyss outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wilde, up from the bottom turn'd by furious windes and surging waves, as mountains to assault heav'ns highth, and with the center mix the pole. silence, ye troubl'd waves, and thou deep, peace, said then th' omnific word, your discord end: nor staid, but on the wings of cherubim uplifted, in paternal glorie rode farr into chaos, and the world unborn; for chaos heard his voice: him all his traine follow'd in bright procession to behold creation, and the wonders of his might. then staid the fervid wheeles, and in his hand he took the golden compasses, prepar'd in gods eternal store, to circumscribe this universe, and all created things: one foot he center'd, and the other turn'd round through the vast profunditie obscure, and said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds, this be thy just circumference, o world. thus god the heav'n created, thus the earth, matter unform'd and void: darkness profound cover'd th' abyss: but on the watrie calme his brooding wings the spirit of god outspred, and vital vertue infus'd, and vital warmth throughout the fluid mass, but downward purg'd the black tartareous cold infernal dregs adverse to life: then founded, then conglob'd like things to like, the rest to several place disparted, and between spun out the air, and earth self ballanc't on her center hung. let ther be light, said god, and forthwith light ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure sprung from the deep, and from her native east to journie through the airie gloom began, sphear'd in a radiant cloud, for yet the sun was not; shee in a cloudie tabernacle sojourn'd the while. god saw the light was good; and light from darkness by the hemisphere divided: light the day, and darkness night he nam'd. thus was the first day eev'n and morn: nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung by the celestial quires, when orient light exhaling first from darkness they beheld; birth-day of heav'n and earth; with joy and shout the hollow universal orb they fill'd, and touch't thir golden harps, and hymning prais'd god and his works, creatour him they sung, both when first eevning was, and when first morn. again, god said, let ther be firmament amid the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters: and god made the firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, transparent, elemental air, diffus'd in circuit to the uttermost convex of this great round: partition firm and sure, the waters underneath from those above dividing: for as earth, so he the world built on circumfluous waters calme, in wide crystallin ocean, and the loud misrule of chaos farr remov'd, least fierce extreames contiguous might distemper the whole frame: and heav'n he nam'd the firmament: so eev'n and morning chorus sung the second day. the earth was form'd, but in the womb as yet of waters, embryon immature involv'd, appeer'd not: over all the face of earth main ocean flow'd, not idle, but with warme prolific humour soft'ning all her globe, fermented the great mother to conceave, satiate with genial moisture, when god said be gather'd now ye waters under heav'n into one place, and let dry land appeer. immediately the mountains huge appeer emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave into the clouds, thir tops ascend the skie: so high as heav'd the tumid hills, so low down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep, capacious bed of waters: thither they hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld as drops on dust conglobing from the drie; part rise in crystal wall, or ridge direct, for haste; such flight the great command impress'd on the swift flouds: as armies at the call of trumpet (for of armies thou hast heard) troop to thir standard, so the watrie throng, wave rowling after wave, where way they found, if steep, with torrent rapture, if through plaine, soft-ebbing; nor withstood them rock or hill, but they, or under ground, or circuit wide with serpent errour wandring, found thir way, and on the washie oose deep channels wore; easie, e're god had bid the ground be drie, all but within those banks, where rivers now stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine. the dry land, earth, and the great receptacle of congregated waters he call'd seas: and saw that it was good, and said, let th' earth put forth the verdant grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit tree yielding fruit after her kind; whose seed is in her self upon the earth. he scarce had said, when the bare earth, till then desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn'd, brought forth the tender grass, whose verdure clad her universal face with pleasant green, then herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour'd op'ning thir various colours, and made gay her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown, forth flourish't thick the clustring vine, forth crept the smelling gourd, up stood the cornie reed embattell'd in her field: and the humble shrub, and bush with frizl'd hair implicit: last rose as in dance the stately trees, and spred thir branches hung with copious fruit; or gemm'd thir blossoms: with high woods the hills were crownd, with tufts the vallies and each fountain side, with borders long the rivers. that earth now seemd like to heav'n, a seat where gods might dwell, or wander with delight, and love to haunt her sacred shades: though god had yet not rain'd upon the earth, and man to till the ground none was, but from the earth a dewie mist went up and waterd all the ground, and each plant of the field, which e're it was in the earth god made, and every herb, before it grew on the green stemm; god saw that it was good. so eev'n and morn recorded the third day. again th' almightie spake: let there be lights high in th' expanse of heaven to divide the day from night; and let them be for signes, for seasons, and for dayes, and circling years, and let them be for lights as i ordaine thir office in the firmament of heav'n to give light on the earth; and it was so. and god made two great lights, great for thir use to man, the greater to have rule by day, the less by night alterne: and made the starrs, and set them in the firmament of heav'n to illuminate the earth, and rule the day in thir vicissitude, and rule the night, and light from darkness to divide. god saw, surveying his great work, that it was good: for of celestial bodies first the sun a mightie spheare he fram'd, unlightsom first, though of ethereal mould: then form'd the moon globose, and every magnitude of starrs, and sowd with starrs the heav'n thick as a field: of light by farr the greater part he took, transplanted from her cloudie shrine, and plac'd in the suns orb, made porous to receive and drink the liquid light, firm to retaine her gather'd beams, great palace now of light. hither as to thir fountain other starrs repairing, in thir gold'n urns draw light, and hence the morning planet guilds her horns; by tincture or reflection they augment thir small peculiar, though from human sight so farr remote, with diminution seen. first in his east the glorious lamp was seen, regent of day, and all th' horizon round invested with bright rayes, jocond to run his longitude through heav'ns high rode: the gray dawn, and the pleiades before him danc'd shedding sweet influence: less bright the moon, but opposite in leveld west was set his mirror, with full face borrowing her light from him, for other light she needed none in that aspect, and still that distance keepes till night, then in the east her turn she shines, revolvd on heav'ns great axle, and her reign with thousand lesser lights dividual holds, with thousand thousand starres, that then appeer'd spangling the hemisphere: then first adornd with thir bright luminaries that set and rose, glad eevning and glad morn crownd the fourth day. and god said, let the waters generate reptil with spawn abundant, living soule: and let fowle flie above the earth, with wings displayd on the op'n firmament of heav'n. and god created the great whales, and each soul living, each that crept, which plenteously the waters generated by thir kindes, and every bird of wing after his kinde; and saw that it was good, and bless'd them, saying, be fruitful, multiply, and in the seas and lakes and running streams the waters fill; and let the fowle be multiply'd on the earth. forthwith the sounds and seas, each creek and bay with frie innumerable swarme, and shoales of fish that with thir finns and shining scales glide under the green wave, in sculles that oft bank the mid sea: part single or with mate graze the sea weed thir pasture, and through groves of coral stray, or sporting with quick glance show to the sun thir wav'd coats dropt with gold, or in thir pearlie shells at ease, attend moist nutriment, or under rocks thir food in jointed armour watch: on smooth the seale, and bended dolphins play: part huge of bulk wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir gate tempest the ocean: there leviathan hugest of living creatures, on the deep stretcht like a promontorie sleeps or swimmes, and seems a moving land, and at his gilles draws in, and at his trunck spouts out a sea. mean while the tepid caves, and fens and shoares thir brood as numerous hatch, from the egg that soon bursting with kindly rupture forth disclos'd thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge they summ'd thir penns, and soaring th' air sublime with clang despis'd the ground, under a cloud in prospect; there the eagle and the stork on cliffs and cedar tops thir eyries build: part loosly wing the region, part more wise in common, rang'd in figure wedge thir way, intelligent of seasons, and set forth thir aierie caravan high over sea's flying, and over lands with mutual wing easing thir flight; so stears the prudent crane her annual voiage, born on windes; the aire floats, as they pass, fann'd with unnumber'd plumes: from branch to branch the smaller birds with song so1ac'd the woods, and spred thir painted wings till ev'n, nor then the solemn nightingal ceas'd warbling, but all night tun'd her soft layes: others on silver lakes and rivers bath'd thir downie brest; the swan with arched neck between her white wings mantling proudly, rowes her state with oarie feet: yet oft they quit the dank, and rising on stiff pennons, towre the mid aereal skie: others on ground walk'd firm; the crested cock whose clarion sounds the silent hours, and th' other whose gay traine adorns him, colour'd with the florid hue of rainbows and starrie eyes. the waters thus with fish replenisht, and the aire with fowle, ev'ning and morn solemniz'd the fift day. the sixt, and of creation last arose with eevning harps and mattin, when god said, let th' earth bring forth foul living in her kinde, cattel and creeping things, and beast of the earth, each in their kinde. the earth obey'd, and strait op'ning her fertil woomb teem'd at a birth innumerous living creatures, perfet formes, limb'd and full grown: out of the ground up rose as from his laire the wilde beast where he wonns in forrest wilde, in thicket, brake, or den; among the trees in pairs they rose, they walk'd: the cattel in the fields and meddowes green: those rare and solitarie, these in flocks pasturing at once, and in broad herds upsprung. the grassie clods now calv'd, now half appeer'd the tawnie lion, pawing to get free his hinder parts, then springs as broke from bonds, and rampant shakes his brinded main; the ounce, the libbard, and the tyger, as the moale rising, the crumbl'd earth above them threw in hillocks; the swift stag from under ground bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould behemoth biggest born of earth upheav'd his vastness: fleec't the flocks and bleating rose, as plants: ambiguous between sea and land the river horse and scalie crocodile. at once came forth whatever creeps the ground, insect or worme; those wav'd thir limber fans for wings, and smallest lineaments exact in all the liveries dect of summers pride with spots of gold and purple, azure and green: these as a line thir long dimension drew, streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all minims of nature; some of serpent kinde wondrous in length and corpulence involv'd thir snakie foulds, and added wings. first crept the parsimonious emmet, provident of future, in small room large heart enclos'd, pattern of just equalitie perhaps hereafter, join'd in her popular tribes of commonaltie: swarming next appeer'd the female bee that feeds her husband drone deliciously, and builds her waxen cells with honey stor'd: the rest are numberless, and thou thir natures know'st, & gav'st them names, needless to thee repeated; nor unknown the serpent suttl'st beast of all the field, of huge extent somtimes, with brazen eyes and hairie main terrific, though to thee not noxious, but obedient at thy call. now heav'n in all her glorie shon, and rowld her motions, as the great first movers hand first wheeld thir course; earth in her rich attire consummate lovly smil'd; aire, water, earth, by fowl, fish, beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt frequent; and of the sixt day yet remain'd; there wanted yet the master work, the end of all yet don; a creature who not prone and brute as other creatures, but endu'd with sanctitie of reason, might erect his stature, and upright with front serene govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence magnanimous to correspond with heav'n, but grateful to acknowledge whence his good descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes directed in devotion, to adore and worship god supream, who made him chief of all his works; therefore the omnipotent eternal father (for where is not hee present) thus to his son audibly spake. let us make now man in our image, man in our similitude, and let them rule over the fish and fowle of sea and aire, beast of the field, and over all the earth, and every creeping thing that creeps the ground. this said, he formd thee, adam, thee o man dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath'd the breath of life; in his own image hee created thee, in the image of god express, and thou becam'st a living soul. male he created thee, but thy consort female for race; then bless'd mankinde, and said, be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the earth, subdue it, and throughout dominion hold over fish of the sea, and fowle of the aire, and every living thing that moves on the earth. wherever thus created, for no place is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knows't he brought thee into this delicious grove, this garden, planted with the trees of god, delectable both to behold and taste; and freely all thir pleasant fruit for food gave thee, all sorts are here that all th' earth yields, varietie without end; but of the tree which tasted works knowledge of good and evil, thou mai'st not; in the day thou eat'st, thou di'st; death is the penaltie impos'd, beware, and govern well thy appetite, least sin surprise thee, and her black attendant death. here finish'd hee, and all that he had made view'd, and behold all was entirely good; so ev'n and morn accomplish'd the sixt day: yet not till the creator from his work desisting, though unwearied, up returnd up to the heav'n of heav'ns his high abode, thence to behold this new created world th' addition of his empire, how it shew'd in prospect from his throne, how good, how faire, answering his great idea. up he rode followd with acclamation and the sound symphonious of ten thousand harpes that tun'd angelic harmonies: the earth, the aire resounded, (thou remember'st, for thou heardst) the heav'ns and all the constellations rung, the planets in thir station list'ning stood, while the bright pomp ascended jubilant. open, ye everlasting gates, they sung, open, ye heav'ns, your living dores; let in the great creator from his work returnd magnificent, his six days work, a world; open, and henceforth oft; for god will deigne to visit oft the dwellings of just men delighted, and with frequent intercourse thither will send his winged messengers on errands of supernal grace. so sung the glorious train ascending: he through heav'n, that open'd wide her blazing portals, led to gods eternal house direct the way, a broad and ample rode, whose dust is gold and pavement starrs, as starrs to thee appeer, seen in the galaxie, that milkie way which nightly as a circling zone thou seest pouderd with starrs. and now on earth the seventh eev'ning arose in eden, for the sun was set, and twilight from the east came on, forerunning night; when at the holy mount of heav'ns high-seated top, th' impereal throne of godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure, the filial power arriv'd, and sate him down with his great father (for he also went invisible, yet staid (such priviledge hath omnipresence) and the work ordain'd, author and end of all things, and from work now resting, bless'd and hallowd the seav'nth day, as resting on that day from all his work, but not in silence holy kept; the harp had work and rested not, the solemn pipe, and dulcimer, all organs of sweet stop, all sounds on fret by string or golden wire temper'd sort tunings, intermixt with voice choral or unison: of incense clouds fuming from golden censers hid the mount. creation and the six dayes acts they sung, great are thy works, jehovah, infinite thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue relate thee; greater now in thy return then from the giant angels; thee that day thy thunders magnifi'd; but to create is greater then created to destroy. who can impair thee, mighty king, or bound thy empire? easily the proud attempt of spirits apostat and thir counsels vaine thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw the number of thy worshippers. who seekes to lessen thee, against his purpose serves to manifest the more thy might: his evil thou usest, and from thence creat'st more good. witness this new-made world, another heav'n from heaven gate not farr, founded in view on the cleer hyaline, the glassie sea; of amplitude almost immense, with starr's numerous, and every starr perhaps a world of destind habitation; but thou know'st thir seasons: among these the seat of men, earth with her nether ocean circumfus'd, thir pleasant dwelling place. thrice happie men, and sons of men, whom god hath thus advanc't, created in his image, there to dwell and worship him, and in reward to rule over his works, on earth, in sea, or air, and multiply a race of worshippers holy and just: thrice happie if they know thir happiness, and persevere upright. so sung they, and the empyrean rung, with halleluiahs: thus was sabbath kept. and thy request think now fulfill'd, that ask'd how first this world and face of things began, and what before thy memorie was don from the beginning, that posteritie informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst aught, not surpassing human measure, say. <line>","religion,christianity,god & the divine"

and if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead? and if the body does not do fully as much as the soul? and if the body were not the soul, what is the soul? 2 the love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body itself balks account, that of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect. the expression of the face balks account, but the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face, it is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists, it is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees, dress does not hide him, the strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth, to see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more, you linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side. the sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards, the swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the water, the bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the horseman in his saddle, girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances, the group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting, the female soothing a child, the farmer’s daughter in the garden or cow-yard, the young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six horses through the crowd, the wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sun-down after work, the coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance, the upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes; the march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps, the slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the alert, the natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv’d neck and the counting; such-like i love—i loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother’s breast with the little child, swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, count. 3 i knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons, and in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons. this man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person, the shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness and breadth of his manners, these i used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also, he was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome, they and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him, they did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love, he drank water only, the blood show’d like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face, he was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail’d his boat himself, he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him, when he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang, you would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other. 4 i have perceiv’d that to be with those i like is enough, to stop in company with the rest at evening is enough, to be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough, to pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then? i do not ask any more delight, i swim in it as in a sea. there is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well, all things please the soul, but these please the soul well. 5 this is the female form, a divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot, it attracts with fierce undeniable attraction, i am drawn by its breath as if i were no more than a helpless vapor, all falls aside but myself and it, books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what was expected of heaven or fear’d of hell, are now consumed, mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response likewise ungovernable, hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all diffused, mine too diffused, ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching, limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice, bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn, undulating into the willing and yielding day, lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh’d day. this the nucleus—after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman, this the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the outlet again. be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest, you are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul. the female contains all qualities and tempers them, she is in her place and moves with perfect balance, she is all things duly veil’d, she is both passive and active, she is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters. as i see my soul reflected in nature, as i see through a mist, one with inexpressible completeness, sanity, beauty, see the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the female i see. 6 the male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place, he too is all qualities, he is action and power, the flush of the known universe is in him, scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well, the wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost become him well, pride is for him, the full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul, knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to the test of himself, whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes soundings at last only here, (where else does he strike soundings except here?) the man’s body is sacred and the woman’s body is sacred, no matter who it is, it is sacred—is it the meanest one in the laborers’ gang? is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf? each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off, just as much as you, each has his or her place in the procession. (all is a procession, the universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.) do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant? do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no right to a sight? do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation sprouts, for you only, and not for him and her? 7 a man’s body at auction, (for before the war i often go to the slave-mart and watch the sale,) i help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know his business. gentlemen look on this wonder, whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it, for it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or plant, for it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll’d. in this head the all-baffling brain, in it and below it the makings of heroes. examine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in tendon and nerve, they shall be stript that you may see them. exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition, flakes of breast-muscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby, good-sized arms and legs, and wonders within there yet. within there runs blood, the same old blood! the same red-running blood! there swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires, reachings, aspirations, (do you think they are not there because they are not express’d in parlors and lecture-rooms?) this is not only one man, this the father of those who shall be fathers in their turns, in him the start of populous states and rich republics, of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments. how do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries? (who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace back through the centuries?) 8 a woman’s body at auction, she too is not only herself, she is the teeming mother of mothers, she is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers. have you ever loved the body of a woman? have you ever loved the body of a man? do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations and times all over the earth? if any thing is sacred the human body is sacred, and the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted, and in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is more beautiful than the most beautiful face. have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool that corrupted her own live body? for they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves. 9 o my body! i dare not desert the likes of you in other men and women, nor the likes of the parts of you, i believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the soul, (and that they are the soul,) i believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems, and that they are my poems, man’s, woman’s, child’s, youth’s, wife’s, husband’s, mother’s, father’s, young man’s, young woman’s poems, head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears, eyes, eye-fringes, iris of the eye, eyebrows, and the waking or sleeping of the lids, mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw-hinges, nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition, cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck, neck-slue, strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hind-shoulders, and the ample side-round of the chest, upper-arm, armpit, elbow-socket, lower-arm, arm-sinews, arm-bones, wrist and wrist-joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, forefinger, finger-joints, finger-nails, broad breast-front, curling hair of the breast, breast-bone, breast-side, ribs, belly, backbone, joints of the backbone, hips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, inward and outward round, man-balls, man-root, strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above, leg fibres, knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under-leg, ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the heel; all attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings of my or your body or of any one’s body, male or female, the lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, the bowels sweet and clean, the brain in its folds inside the skull-frame, sympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, sexuality, maternity, womanhood, and all that is a woman, and the man that comes from woman, the womb, the teats, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturbations and risings, the voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting aloud, food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, walking, swimming, poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening, the continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the eyes, the skin, the sunburnt shade, freckles, hair, the curious sympathy one feels when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body, the circling rivers the breath, and breathing it in and out, the beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees, the thin red jellies within you or within me, the bones and the marrow in the bones, the exquisite realization of health; o i say these are not the parts and poems of the body only, but of the soul, o i say now these are the soul! <line>","the body,the mind,love,desire,infatuation & crushes,realistic & complicated,relationships,nature,religion,the spiritual"
10289,7336,"<line> <line>five years have past; five summers, with the length of five long winters! and again i hear these waters, rolling from their mountain-springs with a soft inland murmur.—once again do i behold these steep and lofty cliffs, that on a wild secluded scene impress thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect the landscape with the quiet of the sky. the day is come when i again repose here, under this dark sycamore, and view these plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts, which at this season, with their unripe fruits, are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves 'mid groves and copses. once again i see these hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms, green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke sent up, in silence, from among the trees! with some uncertain notice, as might seem of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods, or of some hermit's cave, where by his fire the hermit sits alone. these beauteous forms, through a long absence, have not been to me as is a landscape to a blind man's eye: but oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din of towns and cities, i have owed to them, in hours of weariness, sensations sweet, felt in the blood, and felt along the heart; and passing even into my purer mind with tranquil restoration:—feelings too of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps, as have no slight or trivial influence on that best portion of a good man's life, his little, nameless, unremembered, acts of kindness and of love. nor less, i trust, to them i may have owed another gift, of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood, in which the burthen of the mystery, in which the heavy and the weary weight of all this unintelligible world, is lightened:—that serene and blessed mood, in which the affections gently lead us on,— until, the breath of this corporeal frame and even the motion of our human blood almost suspended, we are laid asleep in body, and become a living soul: while with an eye made quiet by the power of harmony, and the deep power of joy, we see into the life of things. if this be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft— in darkness and amid the many shapes of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir unprofitable, and the fever of the world, have hung upon the beatings of my heart— how oft, in spirit, have i turned to thee, o sylvan wye! thou wanderer thro' the woods, how often has my spirit turned to thee! and now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought, with many recognitions dim and faint, and somewhat of a sad perplexity, the picture of the mind revives again: while here i stand, not only with the sense of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts that in this moment there is life and food for future years. and so i dare to hope, though changed, no doubt, from what i was when first i came among these hills; when like a roe i bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams, wherever nature led: more like a man flying from something that he dreads, than one who sought the thing he loved. for nature then (the coarser pleasures of my boyish days and their glad animal movements all gone by) to me was all in all.—i cannot paint what then i was. the sounding cataract haunted me like a passion: the tall rock, the mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, their colours and their forms, were then to me an appetite; a feeling and a love, that had no need of a remoter charm, by thought supplied, not any interest unborrowed from the eye.—that time is past, and all its aching joys are now no more, and all its dizzy raptures. not for this faint i, nor mourn nor murmur; other gifts have followed; for such loss, i would believe, abundant recompense. for i have learned to look on nature, not as in the hour of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes the still sad music of humanity, nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power to chasten and subdue.—and i have felt a presence that disturbs me with the joy of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime of something far more deeply interfused, whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, and the round ocean and the living air, and the blue sky, and in the mind of man: a motion and a spirit, that impels all thinking things, all objects of all thought, and rolls through all things. therefore am i still a lover of the meadows and the woods and mountains; and of all that we behold from this green earth; of all the mighty world of eye, and ear,—both what they half create, and what perceive; well pleased to recognise in nature and the language of the sense the anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse, the guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul of all my moral being. nor perchance, if i were not thus taught, should i the more suffer my genial spirits to decay: for thou art with me here upon the banks of this fair river; thou my dearest friend, my dear, dear friend; and in thy voice i catch the language of my former heart, and read my former pleasures in the shooting lights of thy wild eyes. oh! yet a little while may i behold in thee what i was once, my dear, dear sister! and this prayer i make, knowing that nature never did betray the heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege, through all the years of this our life, to lead from joy to joy: for she can so inform the mind that is within us, so impress with quietness and beauty, and so feed with lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues, rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men, nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all the dreary intercourse of daily life, shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb our cheerful faith, that all which we behold is full of blessings. therefore let the moon shine on thee in thy solitary walk; and let the misty mountain-winds be free to blow against thee: and, in after years, when these wild ecstasies shall be matured into a sober pleasure; when thy mind shall be a mansion for all lovely forms, thy memory be as a dwelling-place for all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then, if solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief, should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts of tender joy wilt thou remember me, and these my exhortations! nor, perchance— if i should be where i no more can hear thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams of past existence—wilt thou then forget that on the banks of this delightful stream we stood together; and that i, so long a worshipper of nature, hither came unwearied in that service: rather say with warmer love—oh! with far deeper zeal of holier love. nor wilt thou then forget, that after many wanderings, many years of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs, and this green pastoral landscape, were to me more dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!

the sun upsprings behind, broad, red, radiant, half-reclin'd on the level quivering line of the water crystalline; and before that chasm of light, as within a furnace bright, column, tower, and dome, and spire, shine like obelisks of fire, pointing with inconstant motion from the altar of dark ocean to the sapphire-tinted skies; as the flames of sacrifice from the marble shrines did rise, as to pierce the dome of gold where apollo spoke of old. sun-girt city, thou hast been ocean's child, and then his queen; now is come a darker day, and thou soon must be his prey, if the power that rais'd thee here hallow so thy watery bier. a less drear ruin then than now, with thy conquest-branded brow stooping to the slave of slaves from thy throne, among the waves wilt thou be, when the sea-mew flies, as once before it flew, o'er thine isles depopulate, and all is in its ancient state, save where many a palace gate with green sea-flowers overgrown like a rock of ocean's own, topples o'er the abandon'd sea as the tides change sullenly. the fisher on his watery way, wandering at the close of day, will spread his sail and seize his oar till he pass the gloomy shore, lest thy dead should, from their sleep bursting o'er the starlight deep, lead a rapid masque of death o'er the waters of his path. those who alone thy towers behold quivering through a{:e}real gold, as i now behold them here, would imagine not they were sepulchres, where human forms, like pollution-nourish'd worms, to the corpse of greatness cling, murder'd, and now mouldering: but if freedom should awake in her omnipotence, and shake from the celtic anarch's hold all the keys of dungeons cold, where a hundred cities lie chain'd like thee, ingloriously, thou and all thy sister band might adorn this sunny land, twining memories of old time with new virtues more sublime; if not, perish thou and they, clouds which stain truth's rising day by her sun consum'd away— earth can spare ye! while like flowers, in the waste of years and hours, from your dust new nations spring with more kindly blossoming. perish—let there only be floating o'er thy hearthless sea as the garment of thy sky clothes the world immortally, one remembrance, more sublime than the tatter'd pall of time, which scarce hides thy visage wan: that a tempest-cleaving swan of the sons of albion, driven from his ancestral streams by the might of evil dreams, found a nest in thee; and ocean welcom'd him with such emotion that its joy grew his, and sprung from his lips like music flung o'er a mighty thunder-fit, chastening terror: what though yet poesy's unfailing river, which through albion winds forever lashing with melodious wave many a sacred poet's grave, mourn its latest nursling fled! what though thou with all thy dead scarce can for this fame repay aught thine own, oh, rather say though thy sins and slaveries foul overcloud a sunlike soul! as the ghost of homer clings round scamander's wasting springs; as divinest shakespeare's might fills avon and the world with light like omniscient power which he imag'd 'mid mortality; as the love from petrarch's urn yet amid yon hills doth burn, a quenchless lamp by which the heart sees things unearthly; so thou art, mighty spirit: so shall be the city that did refuge thee. lo, the sun floats up the sky like thought-winged liberty, till the universal light seems to level plain and height; from the sea a mist has spread, and the beams of morn lie dead on the towers of venice now, like its glory long ago. by the skirts of that gray cloud many-domed padua proud stands, a peopled solitude, 'mid the harvest-shining plain, where the peasant heaps his grain in the garner of his foe, and the milk-white oxen slow with the purple vintage strain, heap'd upon the creaking wain, that the brutal celt may swill drunken sleep with savage will; and the sickle to the sword lies unchang'd though many a lord, like a weed whose shade is poison, overgrows this region's foison, sheaves of whom are ripe to come to destruction's harvest-home: men must reap the things they sow, force from force must ever flow, or worse; but 'tis a bitter woe that love or reason cannot change the despot's rage, the slave's revenge. padua, thou within whose walls those mute guests at festivals, son and mother, death and sin, play'd at dice for ezzelin, till death cried, 'i win, i win!' and sin curs'd to lose the wager, but death promis'd, to assuage her, that he would petition for her to be made vice-emperor, when the destin'd years were o'er, over all between the po and the eastern alpine snow, under the mighty austrian. sin smil'd so as sin only can, and since that time, ay, long before, both have rul'd from shore to shore, that incestuous pair, who follow tyrants as the sun the swallow, as repentance follows crime, and as changes follow time. in thine halls the lamp of learning, padua, now no more is burning; like a meteor, whose wild way is lost over the grave of day, it gleams betray'd and to betray: once remotest nations came to adore that sacred flame, when it lit not many a hearth on this cold and gloomy earth: now new fires from antique light spring beneath the wide world's might; but their spark lies dead in thee, trampled out by tyranny. as the norway woodman quells, in the depth of piny dells, one light flame among the brakes, while the boundless forest shakes, and its mighty trunks are torn by the fire thus lowly born: the spark beneath his feet is dead, he starts to see the flames it fed howling through the darken'd sky with myriad tongues victoriously, and sinks down in fear: so thou, o tyranny, beholdest now light around thee, and thou hearest the loud flames ascend, and fearest: grovel on the earth; ay, hide in the dust thy purple pride! noon descends around me now: 'tis the noon of autumn's glow, when a soft and purple mist like a vaporous amethyst, or an air-dissolved star mingling light and fragrance, far from the curv'd horizon's bound to the point of heaven's profound, fills the overflowing sky; and the plains that silent lie underneath, the leaves unsodden where the infant frost has trodden with his morning-winged feet, whose bright print is gleaming yet; and the red and golden vines, piercing with their trellis'd lines the rough, dark-skirted wilderness; the dun and bladed grass no less, pointing from his hoary tower in the windless air; the flower glimmering at my feet; the line of the olive-sandall'd apennine in the south dimly islanded; and the alps, whose snows are spread high between the clouds and sun; and of living things each one; and my spirit which so long darken'd this swift stream of song, interpenetrated lie by the glory of the sky: be it love, light, harmony, odour, or the soul of all which from heaven like dew doth fall, or the mind which feeds this verse peopling the lone universe. noon descends, and after noon autumn's evening meets me soon, leading the infantine moon, and that one star, which to her almost seems to minister half the crimson light she brings from the sunset's radiant springs: and the soft dreams of the morn (which like winged winds had borne to that silent isle, which lies mid remember'd agonies, the frail bark of this lone being) pass, to other sufferers fleeing, and its ancient pilot, pain, sits beside the helm again. other flowering isles must be in the sea of life and agony: other spirits float and flee o'er that gulf: even now, perhaps, on some rock the wild wave wraps, with folded wings they waiting sit for my bark, to pilot it to some calm and blooming cove, where for me, and those i love, may a windless bower be built, far from passion, pain and guilt, in a dell mid lawny hills, which the wild sea-murmur fills, and soft sunshine, and the sound of old forests echoing round, and the light and smell divine of all flowers that breathe and shine: we may live so happy there, that the spirits of the air, envying us, may even entice to our healing paradise the polluting multitude; but their rage would be subdu'd by that clime divine and calm, and the winds whose wings rain balm on the uplifted soul, and leaves under which the bright sea heaves; while each breathless interval in their whisperings musical the inspired soul supplies with its own deep melodies, and the love which heals all strife circling, like the breath of life, all things in that sweet abode with its own mild brotherhood: they, not it, would change; and soon every sprite beneath the moon would repent its envy vain, and the earth grow young again. <line>","living,death,activities,travels & journeys,nature,landscapes & pastorals,winter,arts & sciences,poetry & poets,mythology & folklore,greek & roman mythology"

10395,1118,"<line> <line>long before the fresh apple crisis, my life had some form to it. i would wake in the mornings—i would perform something. for example, the day i tried, as one with acute passion might, to win one woman over but accidentally won another—that whole time i had been living like someone. though i can’t remember his name. his model of optimism provided me with a certain geography that i inhabit in time of need. this time the need was surprising. people tend to have faith that the juice they drink in the morning is the same juice they have always drunk. and apples take their shape naturally. the guy, whose name escapes me now, taught me to look upon others’ concerns as mine to make at home. i was fond of doing many things at home, but my favorite was drinking juice. when my friends came by—they liked to suddenly show up with all kinds of breads in their hands, thinking they knew what i needed and planning to force it on me—i had to tell them i was busy with my juice. two weeks before the crisis, i had been writing some poems about it. it was a warm day, not entirely different from other warm days in san francisco. people were on the street. pale people were on the street, making it to the park and lying there such that the next day they were a little browned. the poems i had written were failures, but dense ones. it seemed appropriate to think the person’s attempt at wholeness was a series of missteps, which if drawn across an afternoon might prove interesting to other people. i had a way of reminding my friends that we were all in pain, but a fruit tart kind of pain strangers can’t help but enjoy. that day i had, in a sense, gathered all my possessions and gone out onto the street with them. i awoke that morning with an urgency to prepare myself for something—not anything life threatening, but definitely personal. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>my lover, then, wanted to spend much of her life asleep. she had no ostensible reaction to the city’s sudden depletion of all its fresh apples and no hope for them. in a world where a person’s tastes revolve around the kind of sleep she gets, i could not find four people who cared. i thought that if i could find those four people we could really do something. a few of my friends pretended they were chosen. a few neighbors felt bad and made offers. my mother called to console me. my lover—in actuality, the closest person to being a member of the encumbered troop, slept next to me. sleep became our network: falling in and out of it for change. the rule of survival is that no two people can lie in the same bed and sleep at the same time. so i kept an eye on her and played this game of freshness. if by morning i could quickly run out and do seven things that did not involve longing, she would reward me. before the crisis, the reward would have needed only to be an apple one. but after the apples were gone. the landscape usually contains the solution to what’s lost. demographics help people in cars. some people did not notice me. some demographers lose sleep and do not notice me. that was two days before. the evening before it was two days before the crisis, i was thinking that i did not think i was asleep. i had been watching the sunlight take the corner of my room and my housemate’s cat in it. when i looked again, there was no light—but i had not been asleep. it’s the way people react to traumatic events. they say, “i had just been there” or will say, “she was just with me.” so the loss of light was emotional and the lost state—demographic. i began to trace things by their disappearance. alone in the room, my memory, and anticipated darkness going for light. people like to talk about the daytime. people in strange moods often miss the daytime. before the crisis it was not often that one would find me in strange moods. i had managed a particular kind of balance fortified by a certain satisfaction of taste. i was happy. i mean, i was in my juice. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>five weeks before the crisis, i was employed at the natural foods grocery around the corner from my house. i did not really work there, but i went there every week. all but the third sunday of each month, i would walk in and find all kinds of juice on sale. not to buy, but to stand next to. shorter people have the privilege of proximity to most cardboard signs. that was one thing. i would stand there and be something for taller people who couldn’t see. i had gotten into the habit of improvised customer service as a way to peruse the juice aisles without being noticed. my parents thought my talents should have led me somewhere. my father would always say, “if you’re not going to be a people person, then numbers will have to do.” he was surprised that with all the time i had on my hands, i chose to spend most of it alone. numbers then did hold some mystery for me, but mostly too high and far-reaching to explore. for years i had known that if there was a wall between where i was and where i needed to be, i did not want it there. some people have personal goals that are demanding. certain goals make it impossible to lounge around in bed. my decision to drink only fresh juice, which costs as much as a small satisfying breakfast, kept me busy rounding up cash. i would have to leave most friendships behind. as a way of keeping my life “wall-free,” i had to divide my time. i would spend the first part of the day searching for volunteer positions in organic juice factories. the second part of my day i would spend telling people about the first part. the other parts are not of substance here. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>twenty-five years before the crisis i had for the first time what would eventually become known to me as apple juice. twenty-three years later a magazine editor would reject my first attempt to recount that experience in litany. i am always drinking in my poems, a good friend says. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>in the first years of my life, everything i ate was mush. today i will tolerate only the toughest of green vegetables and date people who will always forget this. when i had that remarkable glass of apple juice, i had no idea that one day i simply would not be able to find it. the city gets rid of its apples. people find themselves inventing fruit. the day i decided to write poems about it—it was twelve days before the rumors began and fourteen days before the media coverage—i had been resting in my best friend’s easy chair. we were discussing the rise of the smoothie industry when something fantastic occurred to me. five days later i had twenty poems. when a person writes a poem about her passions, people on the street are bound to notice them. the passions overwhelm the body. she carries the body as though it were the book. the friend whose easy chair gave way to my failures moved out of town the next week, and though i miss her it was the failures that saved me. on every other day any kind of crisis one finds particular sayings helpful. if certain words are spoken quietly into a cup of hot water, with the handle of the cup turned toward the wall, whatever strength found in the person may be mirrored in the wall. the person leaves the house with her hand against this wall but strutting slightly. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>in the alley behind the natural foods grocery, i met my second lover for the first time. meeting people in vulnerable places accentuates the passion later. or it may be so hot that the lover never thinks in the present. and the weather was so hot during the crisis. only the alleys had shade. forty-eight days into the crisis, while on a thirst strike, i had to make a run for the alley. not as though people were after me, but the elements. the foundation of anyone feeling that they must get away is need; at the bottom of any body-based need is grace. when i appeared at the opening of the alley, a woman who not twenty-four hours later would be dozing in my bed was stacking crates against the east-side wall. women who work against surfaces inspire me to do things—i thought about telling her, or—short women make me want things. all the time while i was growing up i put a lot of demands on my juice; forty-eight days into the crisis she made me forget it. i did not forget it, but was embroiled. the newspapers were saying things about the past. people were celebrating thick juice, and i kept writing those poems. that day in the alley i realized three things about life. while assisting her i learned three things to carry around with me, to disperse when needed. for six months during the crisis, i did not care about the crisis. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>when my faith returned all my lovers were gone. that morning i woke to the two hundred and thirty-second day of the crisis; i was beneath my bed. it was the sixth day that i had awakened beneath my bed. i was lonely, but i was also sure. life without juice had taken on the name and shape of my weakest character, who—when we passed on the street—did not know me. i knew it was me by the way my head felt: people find themselves in an idea and feel so specified by the idea that they are compelled to show it. today all my ideas are liquid. that day of my faith, friends thinking i was sick came by to see me. it would be the last day i spent alone; i was happy, but still would not drink. the juice on my mind was no longer juice. there was an absence there, but one so constant it became familiar. i did not want to drink it. <line>","living,life choices,the mind,love,realistic & complicated,activities,eating & drinking,arts & sciences,poetry & poets"

her head was full of energy <line> <line>brought forward and positively that what was said would turn the obvious <line> <line>into color, but no sense. sense was for the thinkers. here the thinkers <line> <line>forgot their word orders or sense; it was better to give them coffee, <line> <line>and those off worse could smoke. <line> <line> i had felt very <line> <line>foolish when i leaned forward and grasped his hand, with effort, and <line> <line>his cloak slipped down over one shoulder as he shouted, which is the <line> <line>way. and i followed for certainly no one would follow me. as the day <line> <line>is cold and colder, and what comes out of the head is of its own sort and <line> <line>nature. these words, like nature, and head, thinking and words, <line> <line>repeat themselves, as the lines of landscape, attics and other closed-off <line> <line>sections have reprimanded themselves by repetition. light <line> <line>was such an enormous possibility. taking sight into a frenzy, it was <line> <line>possible that just to look was full of excitement and wonder, for <line> <line>ages at a time, things appeared as beautiful, the sky, the street <line> <line>where cars had gone by. <line> <line> i worried about certain characters: ones <line> <line>that never seemed to be other than puzzles to me but i was drawn to <line> <line>them with certainty only because there seemed to be no understanding? <line> <line>as when the mysteries were performed, the house then itself became <line> <line>distilled with reason as the pots and pans were used apparently filled <line> <line>with the stuff of continuity. the sorrow that each day sinks into the <line> <line>infertile other side of day, where voice comes out of the dark, and <line> <line>does its rituals. memory has its own screen across the room to view <line> <line>itself, and the continuous dwelling of conjecture takes permanent form <line> <line>in stiff-legged walks to remind, thus on and on the breathing goes. <line> <line> new york. january – march, 1967 <line>","living,life choices,the body,the mind,time & brevity,relationships,nature,social commentaries"

10425,7213,"<line> <line>morning and evening <line>maids heard the goblins cry: <line>“come buy our orchard fruits, <line>come buy, come buy: <line>apples and quinces, <line>lemons and oranges, <line>plump unpeck’d cherries, <line>melons and raspberries, <line>bloom-down-cheek’d peaches, <line>swart-headed mulberries, <line>wild free-born cranberries, <line>crab-apples, dewberries, <line>pine-apples, blackberries, <line>apricots, strawberries;— <line>all ripe together <line>in summer weather,— <line>morns that pass by, <line>fair eves that fly; <line>come buy, come buy: <line>our grapes fresh from the vine, <line>pomegranates full and fine, <line>dates and sharp bullaces, <line>rare pears and greengages, <line>damsons and bilberries, <line>taste them and try: <line>currants and gooseberries, <line>bright-fire-like barberries, <line>figs to fill your mouth, <line>citrons from the south, <line>sweet to tongue and sound to eye; <line>come buy, come buy.” <line> <line> evening by evening <line>among the brookside rushes, <line>laura bow’d her head to hear, <line>lizzie veil’d her blushes: <line>crouching close together <line>in the cooling weather, <line>with clasping arms and cautioning lips, <line>with tingling cheeks and finger tips. <line>“lie close,” laura said, <line>pricking up her golden head: <line>“we must not look at goblin men, <line>we must not buy their fruits: <line>who knows upon what soil they fed <line>their hungry thirsty roots?” <line>“come buy,” call the goblins <line>hobbling down the glen. <line>“oh,” cried lizzie, “laura, laura, <line>you should not peep at goblin men.” <line>lizzie cover’d up her eyes, <line>cover’d close lest they should look; <line>laura rear’d her glossy head, <line>and whisper’d like the restless brook: <line>“look, lizzie, look, lizzie, <line>down the glen tramp little men. <line>one hauls a basket, <line>one bears a plate, <line>one lugs a golden dish <line>of many pounds weight. <line>how fair the vine must grow <line>whose grapes are so luscious; <line>how warm the wind must blow <line>through those fruit bushes.” <line>“no,” said lizzie, “no, no, no; <line>their offers should not charm us, <line>their evil gifts would harm us.” <line>she thrust a dimpled finger <line>in each ear, shut eyes and ran: <line>curious laura chose to linger <line>wondering at each merchant man. <line>one had a cat’s face, <line>one whisk’d a tail, <line>one tramp’d at a rat’s pace, <line>one crawl’d like a snail, <line>one like a wombat prowl’d obtuse and furry, <line>one like a ratel tumbled hurry skurry. <line>she heard a voice like voice of doves <line>cooing all together: <line>they sounded kind and full of loves <line>in the pleasant weather. <line> <line> laura stretch’d her gleaming neck <line>like a rush-imbedded swan, <line>like a lily from the beck, <line>like a moonlit poplar branch, <line>like a vessel at the launch <line>when its last restraint is gone. <line> <line> backwards up the mossy glen <line>turn’d and troop’d the goblin men, <line>with their shrill repeated cry, <line>“come buy, come buy.” <line>when they reach’d where laura was <line>they stood stock still upon the moss, <line>leering at each other, <line>brother with queer brother; <line>signalling each other, <line>brother with sly brother. <line>one set his basket down, <line>one rear’d his plate; <line>one began to weave a crown <line>of tendrils, leaves, and rough nuts brown <line>(men sell not such in any town); <line>one heav’d the golden weight <line>of dish and fruit to offer her: <line>“come buy, come buy,” was still their cry. <line>laura stared but did not stir, <line>long’d but had no money: <line>the whisk-tail’d merchant bade her taste <line>in tones as smooth as honey, <line>the cat-faced purr’d, <line>the rat-faced spoke a word <line>of welcome, and the snail-paced even was heard; <line>one parrot-voiced and jolly <line>cried “pretty goblin” still for “pretty polly;”— <line>one whistled like a bird. <line> <line> but sweet-tooth laura spoke in haste: <line>“good folk, i have no coin; <line>to take were to purloin: <line>i have no copper in my purse, <line>i have no silver either, <line>and all my gold is on the furze <line>that shakes in windy weather <line>above the rusty heather.” <line>“you have much gold upon your head,” <line>they answer’d all together: <line>“buy from us with a golden curl.” <line>she clipp’d a precious golden lock, <line>she dropp’d a tear more rare than pearl, <line>then suck’d their fruit globes fair or red: <line>sweeter than honey from the rock, <line>stronger than man-rejoicing wine, <line>clearer than water flow’d that juice; <line>she never tasted such before, <line>how should it cloy with length of use? <line>she suck’d and suck’d and suck’d the more <line>fruits which that unknown orchard bore; <line>she suck’d until her lips were sore; <line>then flung the emptied rinds away <line>but gather’d up one kernel stone, <line>and knew not was it night or day <line>as she turn’d home alone. <line> <line> lizzie met her at the gate <line>full of wise upbraidings: <line>“dear, you should not stay so late, <line>twilight is not good for maidens; <line>should not loiter in the glen <line>in the haunts of goblin men. <line>do you not remember jeanie, <line>how she met them in the moonlight, <line>took their gifts both choice and many, <line>ate their fruits and wore their flowers <line>pluck’d from bowers <line>where summer ripens at all hours? <line>but ever in the noonlight <line>she pined and pined away; <line>sought them by night and day, <line>found them no more, but dwindled and grew grey; <line>then fell with the first snow, <line>while to this day no grass will grow <line>where she lies low: <line>i planted daisies there a year ago <line>that never blow. <line>you should not loiter so.” <line>“nay, hush,” said laura: <line>“nay, hush, my sister: <line>i ate and ate my fill, <line>yet my mouth waters still; <line>to-morrow night i will <line>buy more;” and kiss’d her: <line>“have done with sorrow; <line>i’ll bring you plums to-morrow <line>fresh on their mother twigs, <line>cherries worth getting; <line>you cannot think what figs <line>my teeth have met in, <line>what melons icy-cold <line>piled on a dish of gold <line>too huge for me to hold, <line>what peaches with a velvet nap, <line>pellucid grapes without one seed: <line>odorous indeed must be the mead <line>whereon they grow, and pure the wave they drink <line>with lilies at the brink, <line>and sugar-sweet their sap.” <line> <line> golden head by golden head, <line>like two pigeons in one nest <line>folded in each other’s wings, <line>they lay down in their curtain’d bed: <line>like two blossoms on one stem, <line>like two flakes of new-fall’n snow, <line>like two wands of ivory <line>tipp’d with gold for awful kings. <line>moon and stars gaz’d in at them, <line>wind sang to them lullaby, <line>lumbering owls forbore to fly, <line>not a bat flapp’d to and fro <line>round their rest: <line>cheek to cheek and breast to breast <line>lock’d together in one nest. <line> <line> early in the morning <line>when the first cock crow’d his warning, <line>neat like bees, as sweet and busy, <line>laura rose with lizzie: <line>fetch’d in honey, milk’d the cows, <line>air’d and set to rights the house, <line>kneaded cakes of whitest wheat, <line>cakes for dainty mouths to eat, <line>next churn’d butter, whipp’d up cream, <line>fed their poultry, sat and sew’d; <line>talk’d as modest maidens should: <line>lizzie with an open heart, <line>laura in an absent dream, <line>one content, one sick in part; <line>one warbling for the mere bright day’s delight, <line>one longing for the night. <line> <line> at length slow evening came: <line>they went with pitchers to the reedy brook; <line>lizzie most placid in her look, <line>laura most like a leaping flame. <line>they drew the gurgling water from its deep; <line>lizzie pluck’d purple and rich golden flags, <line>then turning homeward said: “the sunset flushes <line>those furthest loftiest crags; <line>come, laura, not another maiden lags. <line>no wilful squirrel wags, <line>the beasts and birds are fast asleep.” <line>but laura loiter’d still among the rushes <line>and said the bank was steep. <line> <line> and said the hour was early still <line>the dew not fall’n, the wind not chill; <line>listening ever, but not catching <line>the customary cry, <line>“come buy, come buy,” <line>with its iterated jingle <line>of sugar-baited words: <line>not for all her watching <line>once discerning even one goblin <line>racing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling; <line>let alone the herds <line>that used to tramp along the glen, <line>in groups or single, <line>of brisk fruit-merchant men. <line> <line> till lizzie urged, “o laura, come; <line>i hear the fruit-call but i dare not look: <line>you should not loiter longer at this brook: <line>come with me home. <line>the stars rise, the moon bends her arc, <line>each glowworm winks her spark, <line>let us get home before the night grows dark: <line>for clouds may gather <line>though this is summer weather, <line>put out the lights and drench us through; <line>then if we lost our way what should we do?” <line> <line> laura turn’d cold as stone <line>to find her sister heard that cry alone, <line>that goblin cry, <line>“come buy our fruits, come buy.” <line>must she then buy no more such dainty fruit? <line>must she no more such succous pasture find, <line>gone deaf and blind? <line>her tree of life droop’d from the root: <line>she said not one word in her heart’s sore ache; <line>but peering thro’ the dimness, nought discerning, <line>trudg’d home, her pitcher dripping all the way; <line>so crept to bed, and lay <line>silent till lizzie slept; <line>then sat up in a passionate yearning, <line>and gnash’d her teeth for baulk’d desire, and wept <line>as if her heart would break. <line> <line> day after day, night after night, <line>laura kept watch in vain <line>in sullen silence of exceeding pain. <line>she never caught again the goblin cry: <line>“come buy, come buy;”— <line>she never spied the goblin men <line>hawking their fruits along the glen: <line>but when the noon wax’d bright <line>her hair grew thin and grey; <line>she dwindled, as the fair full moon doth turn <line>to swift decay and burn <line>her fire away. <line> <line> one day remembering her kernel-stone <line>she set it by a wall that faced the south; <line>dew’d it with tears, hoped for a root, <line>watch’d for a waxing shoot, <line>but there came none; <line>it never saw the sun, <line>it never felt the trickling moisture run: <line>while with sunk eyes and faded mouth <line>she dream’d of melons, as a traveller sees <line>false waves in desert drouth <line>with shade of leaf-crown’d trees, <line>and burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze. <line> <line> she no more swept the house, <line>tended the fowls or cows, <line>fetch’d honey, kneaded cakes of wheat, <line>brought water from the brook: <line>but sat down listless in the chimney-nook <line>and would not eat. <line> <line> tender lizzie could not bear <line>to watch her sister’s cankerous care <line>yet not to share. <line>she night and morning <line>caught the goblins’ cry: <line>“come buy our orchard fruits, <line>come buy, come buy;”— <line>beside the brook, along the glen, <line>she heard the tramp of goblin men, <line>the yoke and stir <line>poor laura could not hear; <line>long’d to buy fruit to comfort her, <line>but fear’d to pay too dear. <line>she thought of jeanie in her grave, <line>who should have been a bride; <line>but who for joys brides hope to have <line>fell sick and died <line>in her gay prime, <line>in earliest winter time <line>with the first glazing rime, <line>with the first snow-fall of crisp winter time. <line> <line> till laura dwindling <line>seem’d knocking at death’s door: <line>then lizzie weigh’d no more <line>better and worse; <line>but put a silver penny in her purse, <line>kiss’d laura, cross’d the heath with clumps of furze <line>at twilight, halted by the brook: <line>and for the first time in her life <line>began to listen and look. <line> <line> laugh’d every goblin <line>when they spied her peeping: <line>came towards her hobbling, <line>flying, running, leaping, <line>puffing and blowing, <line>chuckling, clapping, crowing, <line>clucking and gobbling, <line>mopping and mowing, <line>full of airs and graces, <line>pulling wry faces, <line>demure grimaces, <line>cat-like and rat-like, <line>ratel- and wombat-like, <line>snail-paced in a hurry, <line>parrot-voiced and whistler, <line>helter skelter, hurry skurry, <line>chattering like magpies, <line>fluttering like pigeons, <line>gliding like fishes,— <line>hugg’d her and kiss’d her: <line>squeez’d and caress’d her: <line>stretch’d up their dishes, <line>panniers, and plates: <line>“look at our apples <line>russet and dun, <line>bob at our cherries, <line>bite at our peaches, <line>citrons and dates, <line>grapes for the asking, <line>pears red with basking <line>out in the sun, <line>plums on their twigs; <line>pluck them and suck them, <line>pomegranates, figs.”— <line> <line> “good folk,” said lizzie, <line>mindful of jeanie: <line>“give me much and many: — <line>held out her apron, <line>toss’d them her penny. <line>“nay, take a seat with us, <line>honour and eat with us,” <line>they answer’d grinning: <line>“our feast is but beginning. <line>night yet is early, <line>warm and dew-pearly, <line>wakeful and starry: <line>such fruits as these <line>no man can carry: <line>half their bloom would fly, <line>half their dew would dry, <line>half their flavour would pass by. <line>sit down and feast with us, <line>be welcome guest with us, <line>cheer you and rest with us.”— <line>“thank you,” said lizzie: “but one waits <line>at home alone for me: <line>so without further parleying, <line>if you will not sell me any <line>of your fruits though much and many, <line>give me back my silver penny <line>i toss’d you for a fee.”— <line>they began to scratch their pates, <line>no longer wagging, purring, <line>but visibly demurring, <line>grunting and snarling. <line>one call’d her proud, <line>cross-grain’d, uncivil; <line>their tones wax’d loud, <line>their looks were evil. <line>lashing their tails <line>they trod and hustled her, <line>elbow’d and jostled her, <line>claw’d with their nails, <line>barking, mewing, hissing, mocking, <line>tore her gown and soil’d her stocking, <line>twitch’d her hair out by the roots, <line>stamp’d upon her tender feet, <line>held her hands and squeez’d their fruits <line>against her mouth to make her eat. <line> <line> white and golden lizzie stood, <line>like a lily in a flood,— <line>like a rock of blue-vein’d stone <line>lash’d by tides obstreperously,— <line>like a beacon left alone <line>in a hoary roaring sea, <line>sending up a golden fire,— <line>like a fruit-crown’d orange-tree <line>white with blossoms honey-sweet <line>sore beset by wasp and bee,— <line>like a royal virgin town <line>topp’d with gilded dome and spire <line>close beleaguer’d by a fleet <line>mad to tug her standard down. <line> <line> one may lead a horse to water, <line>twenty cannot make him drink. <line>though the goblins cuff’d and caught her, <line>coax’d and fought her, <line>bullied and besought her, <line>scratch’d her, pinch’d her black as ink, <line>kick’d and knock’d her, <line>maul’d and mock’d her, <line>lizzie utter’d not a word; <line>would not open lip from lip <line>lest they should cram a mouthful in: <line>but laugh’d in heart to feel the drip <line>of juice that syrupp’d all her face, <line>and lodg’d in dimples of her chin, <line>and streak’d her neck which quaked like curd. <line>at last the evil people, <line>worn out by her resistance, <line>flung back her penny, kick’d their fruit <line>along whichever road they took, <line>not leaving root or stone or shoot; <line>some writh’d into the ground, <line>some div’d into the brook <line>with ring and ripple, <line>some scudded on the gale without a sound, <line>some vanish’d in the distance. <line> <line> in a smart, ache, tingle, <line>lizzie went her way; <line>knew not was it night or day; <line>sprang up the bank, tore thro’ the furze, <line>threaded copse and dingle, <line>and heard her penny jingle <line>bouncing in her purse,— <line>its bounce was music to her ear. <line>she ran and ran <line>as if she fear’d some goblin man <line>dogg’d her with gibe or curse <line>or something worse: <line>but not one goblin scurried after, <line>nor was she prick’d by fear; <line>the kind heart made her windy-paced <line>that urged her home quite out of breath with haste <line>and inward laughter. <line> <line> she cried, “laura,” up the garden, <line>“did you miss me? <line>come and kiss me. <line>never mind my bruises, <line>hug me, kiss me, suck my juices <line>squeez’d from goblin fruits for you, <line>goblin pulp and goblin dew. <line>eat me, drink me, love me; <line>laura, make much of me; <line>for your sake i have braved the glen <line>and had to do with goblin merchant men.” <line> <line> laura started from her chair, <line>flung her arms up in the air, <line>clutch’d her hair: <line>“lizzie, lizzie, have you tasted <line>for my sake the fruit forbidden? <line>must your light like mine be hidden, <line>your young life like mine be wasted, <line>undone in mine undoing, <line>and ruin’d in my ruin, <line>thirsty, canker’d, goblin-ridden?”— <line>she clung about her sister, <line>kiss’d and kiss’d and kiss’d her: <line>tears once again <line>refresh’d her shrunken eyes, <line>dropping like rain <line>after long sultry drouth; <line>shaking with aguish fear, and pain, <line>she kiss’d and kiss’d her with a hungry mouth. <line> <line> her lips began to scorch, <line>that juice was wormwood to her tongue, <line>she loath’d the feast: <line>writhing as one possess’d she leap’d and sung, <line>rent all her robe, and wrung <line>her hands in lamentable haste, <line>and beat her breast. <line>her locks stream’d like the torch <line>borne by a racer at full speed, <line>or like the mane of horses in their flight, <line>or like an eagle when she stems the light <line>straight toward the sun, <line>or like a caged thing freed, <line>or like a flying flag when armies run. <line> <line> swift fire spread through her veins, knock’d at her heart, <line>met the fire smouldering there <line>and overbore its lesser flame; <line>she gorged on bitterness without a name: <line>ah! fool, to choose such part <line>of soul-consuming care! <line>sense fail’d in the mortal strife: <line>like the watch-tower of a town <line>which an earthquake shatters down, <line>like a lightning-stricken mast, <line>like a wind-uprooted tree <line>spun about, <line>like a foam-topp’d waterspout <line>cast down headlong in the sea, <line>she fell at last; <line>pleasure past and anguish past, <line>is it death or is it life? <line> <line> life out of death. <line>that night long lizzie watch’d by her, <line>counted her pulse’s flagging stir, <line>felt for her breath, <line>held water to her lips, and cool’d her face <line>with tears and fanning leaves: <line>but when the first birds chirp’d about their eaves, <line>and early reapers plodded to the place <line>of golden sheaves, <line>and dew-wet grass <line>bow’d in the morning winds so brisk to pass, <line>and new buds with new day <line>open’d of cup-like lilies on the stream, <line>laura awoke as from a dream, <line>laugh’d in the innocent old way, <line>hugg’d lizzie but not twice or thrice; <line>her gleaming locks show’d not one thread of grey, <line>her breath was sweet as may <line>and light danced in her eyes. <line> <line> days, weeks, months, years <line>afterwards, when both were wives <line>with children of their own; <line>their mother-hearts beset with fears, <line>their lives bound up in tender lives; <line>laura would call the little ones <line>and tell them of her early prime, <line>those pleasant days long gone <line>of not-returning time: <line>would talk about the haunted glen, <line>the wicked, quaint fruit-merchant men, <line>their fruits like honey to the throat <line>but poison in the blood; <line>(men sell not such in any town): <line>would tell them how her sister stood <line>in deadly peril to do her good, <line>and win the fiery antidote: <line>then joining hands to little hands <line>would bid them cling together, <line>“for there is no friend like a sister <line>in calm or stormy weather;

""fairest of mortals, thou distinguish'd care of thousand bright inhabitants of air! if e'er one vision touch'd thy infant thought, of all the nurse and all the priest have taught, of airy elves by moonlight shadows seen, the silver token, and the circled green, or virgins visited by angel pow'rs, with golden crowns and wreaths of heav'nly flow'rs, hear and believe! thy own importance know, nor bound thy narrow views to things below. some secret truths from learned pride conceal'd, to maids alone and children are reveal'd: what tho' no credit doubting wits may give? the fair and innocent shall still believe. know then, unnumber'd spirits round thee fly, the light militia of the lower sky; these, though unseen, are ever on the wing, hang o'er the box, and hover round the ring. think what an equipage thou hast in air, and view with scorn two pages and a chair. as now your own, our beings were of old, and once inclos'd in woman's beauteous mould; thence, by a soft transition, we repair from earthly vehicles to these of air. think not, when woman's transient breath is fled, that all her vanities at once are dead; succeeding vanities she still regards, and tho' she plays no more, o'erlooks the cards. her joy in gilded chariots, when alive, and love of ombre, after death survive. for when the fair in all their pride expire, to their first elements their souls retire: the sprites of fiery termagants in flame mount up, and take a salamander's name. soft yielding minds to water glide away, and sip with nymphs, their elemental tea. the graver prude sinks downward to a gnome, in search of mischief still on earth to roam. the light coquettes in sylphs aloft repair, and sport and flutter in the fields of air. know further yet; whoever fair and chaste rejects mankind, is by some sylph embrac'd: for spirits, freed from mortal laws, with ease assume what sexes and what shapes they please. what guards the purity of melting maids, in courtly balls, and midnight masquerades, safe from the treach'rous friend, the daring spark, the glance by day, the whisper in the dark, when kind occasion prompts their warm desires, when music softens, and when dancing fires? 'tis but their sylph, the wise celestials know, though honour is the word with men below. some nymphs there are, too conscious of their face, for life predestin'd to the gnomes' embrace. these swell their prospects and exalt their pride, when offers are disdain'd, and love denied: then gay ideas crowd the vacant brain, while peers, and dukes, and all their sweeping train, and garters, stars, and coronets appear, and in soft sounds 'your grace' salutes their ear. 'tis these that early taint the female soul, instruct the eyes of young coquettes to roll, teach infant cheeks a bidden blush to know, and little hearts to flutter at a beau. oft, when the world imagine women stray, the sylphs through mystic mazes guide their way, thro' all the giddy circle they pursue, and old impertinence expel by new. what tender maid but must a victim fall to one man's treat, but for another's ball? when florio speaks, what virgin could withstand, if gentle damon did not squeeze her hand? with varying vanities, from ev'ry part, they shift the moving toyshop of their heart; where wigs with wigs, with sword-knots sword-knots strive, beaux banish beaux, and coaches coaches drive. this erring mortals levity may call, oh blind to truth! the sylphs contrive it all. of these am i, who thy protection claim, a watchful sprite, and ariel is my name. late, as i rang'd the crystal wilds of air, in the clear mirror of thy ruling star i saw, alas! some dread event impend, ere to the main this morning sun descend, but heav'n reveals not what, or how, or where: warn'd by the sylph, oh pious maid, beware! this to disclose is all thy guardian can. beware of all, but most beware of man!"" he said; when shock, who thought she slept too long, leap'd up, and wak'd his mistress with his tongue. 'twas then, belinda, if report say true, thy eyes first open'd on a billet-doux; wounds, charms, and ardors were no sooner read, but all the vision vanish'd from thy head. and now, unveil'd, the toilet stands display'd, each silver vase in mystic order laid. first, rob'd in white, the nymph intent adores with head uncover'd, the cosmetic pow'rs. a heav'nly image in the glass appears, to that she bends, to that her eyes she rears; th' inferior priestess, at her altar's side, trembling, begins the sacred rites of pride. unnumber'd treasures ope at once, and here the various off'rings of the world appear; from each she nicely culls with curious toil, and decks the goddess with the glitt'ring spoil. this casket india's glowing gems unlocks, and all arabia breathes from yonder box. the tortoise here and elephant unite, transform'd to combs, the speckled and the white. here files of pins extend their shining rows, puffs, powders, patches, bibles, billet-doux. now awful beauty puts on all its arms; the fair each moment rises in her charms, repairs her smiles, awakens ev'ry grace, and calls forth all the wonders of her face; sees by degrees a purer blush arise, and keener lightnings quicken in her eyes. the busy sylphs surround their darling care; these set the head, and those divide the hair, some fold the sleeve, whilst others plait the gown; and betty's prais'd for labours not her own. <line>","relationships,friends & enemies,men & women,arts & sciences,humor & satire,social commentaries"

10461,10658,"<line> <line>sex is always monstrous. blood appears in the air next to the body but nobody asks a question about the body. “please touch me there. more. oh god.” for a hitchhiker, the problem of the boudoir is transferred to a makeshift, itchy, unsafe space on the verge of a new mexico highway. it is often the sex of another era, in which the socks and dress shirt/blouse are not necessarily removed. <line> <line> <line>i hitchhiked in the beginning because it seemed glamorous to me, ultra-american, like a christian with an entrenched migraine who resorts to brand-name anti-inflammatories when prayer does not do the trick. at first, my encounters on the thoroughfares of your country were quotidian; after all, it is not really hitchhiking to buy a greyhound ticket three weeks in advance then have a going-away party in a dorm with a banner and balloons. again, this is an example of departure in another time. as a foreign student on scholarship, it was an ordinary matter to file for an extension for the completion of a thesis on salman rushdie’s early works. nevertheless: “how can we keep tabs on these ji visa holders, who come over here and . . . the university, as an institution, really needs to be more accountable. we need a database and we need a system of checks and balances to make sure any change of address is verified by at least two pieces of information. they need to do their course work and then they need to go home.” <line> <line> <line>i didn’t want to go home. this is a boring sentence. perhaps for you oregon is a calming word, evoking images of blackberry pie, ocean vistas, and the capture of suspected felons. i had never heard the word oregon before. like the distance of scotland from london, it seemed impossibly far. a beautiful hazard: to go and keep going. how can i put this? in england, nobody ever, ever, ever did this. i, who once drove straight to glasgow with a thermos of instant coffee mixed with milk and sugar, in a dinged-up datsun cherry, was considered an anomaly. “are you demented? why do you want to drive in a car to bloody scotland? it’s seven hours on the m1, man!” though, outwardly, i was wan and somewhat reticent, i . . . no, i was. my sexual experience consisted of lying under an elm tree in hyde park at the age of seventeen and being told by an undergraduate student of the london school of economics that my breasts in that position, from that angle, resembled two fried eggs. we were meeting in a park as per the era. i am sure contemporary punjabi-british teenagers are fearless individuals, undaunted by the prospect of community censure. back then we met by the iron-wrought gate on a park bench, on a path built for seventeenth-century promenades. it is always a century. in my century, sex was a field of restraint and intensity unsurpassed by anything except drinking coffee in a foreign country like scotland or wales and borrowing my father’s car forever. “are you out of your bleeding head? your dad’s going to skin you alive!” <line> <line> <line>in some sense, this (driving) is the opposite of hitchhiking, in which the interior of the car is always unfamiliar. the day was real in a different way back then, in the way that it sensitized me to risk, a kind of twin to permisson. two black swans: that day and this one, history and fiction, what i went for and what i really wanted, which i didn’t know until i got there by which time it was impossible to consider the long journey home as either practical or sensible, considering the trouble i was already in and the rain, which had started to come down in a series of reddish sheets; the streetlamps were pink. <line> <line> <line>on prince street, in glasgow, i saw the sign for american style pizza and went down the steps to the basement café. the tables were coated with green plastic. there was hot tea, which the waitress slung down my gullet with a funnel as i focused my eye on a laminated print of a white, blocky rose with a pink dot at its center. “charles rennie mackintosh,” the waitress, pronouncing “osh” so that it rhymed with horse. “are you from india?” “would you like some jam with that scone? i bet they don’t have scones in india, do they?” “more tea? i heard you have a lot of tea, over there, isn’t that right?” <line> <line> <line>plan b: the extension of my throat. the euphoria of theft. other countries with their sayings and beliefs. the original plan, formulated by my father during his morning communte across london: marrying a british-born hindu brahmin dentist with brown skin, but not too brown, and rosy cheeks. note on the mantelpiece, tucked behind the marble figurine of shiva: what is forthcoming under the original plan? extraction? what kind of sex is possible on the dentist’s chair late at night for that girl, your girl, who nervously asks for a blanket? she has her socks on. she’s shivering. it is sometimes sex when you touch yourself beneath the proffered blanket clearly not washed between patients, but in this scene the limbs of the dentist’s young asian bride are rigid and smell faintly of wintergreen-scented nail polish or mouthwash. dad, “please don’t swallow.” rinse then spit. spit then swallow. <line> <line> <line>i could not go home and so, after a brief visit to the hill house—charles rennie mackintosh’s art deco home on the firth of clyde, where he painted geometric rosebuds forever in a kind of frenzy, as it seemed from the décor—i turned left and kept driving. i drove my car into the atlantic and kept driving, my chest very tight beneath the surface. it was difficult to feel anything or really to see, and so i can only say that i went into a damaging ocean. this is going. damaged, washed up on the mythical shores of new jersey a few days later, my car failed to start. this is later, when the car stopped, and, looking up from my hands, white-knuckled on the steering wheel, i realized that i was okay. <line> <line> <line>now i am here, in the future of color. i’m sorry i do not have more to say about the period of submergence that preceded my arrival. i am not interested in it. i do not recall it. i . . . it was only when my car stopped that i realized what i had to do, on my own terms, with my own two legs: get going. is that how you say it? get up and go. the destiny of my body as separate from my childhood: i came here to hitchhike. i came here to complete a thing i began in another place. removing wet pages from my rucksack, i lay them on the shore, securing them with beautiful shells and pebbles. when they dried, i folded them into squares and put them in my pocket, next to my body. misshapen, exhilarated, i said get. i said go. get up now and go. “are you okay?” “do you need a ride somewhere?” “let me look in the trunk. i might have something in there. here you go. you’re shivering! do you need to go to the hospital? at least let me buy you a cup of coffee.” <line>","living,coming of age,life choices,love,desire,activities,travels & journeys,relationships,family & ancestors,social commentaries,cities & urban life,history & politics,popular culture,race & ethnicity"

<line> <line>rough roads north and south, wagons groaning with stone, <line> <line>and into meagre harbours boats and barges <line> <line>hugging the coast bore produce in and away. <line> <line>that world was not for him, with its crosses and crossroads. <line> <line>he saw steep islands dark in a bigger sea, <line> <line>no man mark on them, no smoke, no stone quarry, <line> <line>no furrows or shepherds, in their thin woods no traps. <line> <line>it was summer now (he did not count the days), <line> <line>he sat on the summit of the last hill and looked east <line> <line>wondering where on that island he would build <line> <line>his round stone dwelling and give his mortal days <line> <line>to local grace, the gods of leaf and stone, <line> <line>with his soul configured to love, like a hearth, his heart <line> <line>on fire but unconsumed because such promiscuous heat <line> <line>amazes and makes not cinders but rapture and language. <line> <line>his dwelling would be a beacon, a land-star radiant <line> <line>to a lowering ocean unbroken beyond the islands <line> <line>as far as the eye. shading his eyes, he went on his way. <line> <line>he crossed the bad sands not knowing they were bad <line> <line>between two tides, two islands, walking ankle deep, knee, <line> <line>then up to the waist, the paps, until only his upturned face <line> <line>floated on the water, the mouth crying out joyful spells, <line> <line>eyes fixed on the sun, the flaxen hair fanned out <line> <line>like rays of a lesser sphere. he could not swim <line> <line>but there was no need, a sea god hovered ahead, <line> <line>sandals firm on the wave. <line> <line> emerging step by step <line> <line>he was new, it was autumn, his homelessness <line> <line>this island, these tilting rocks. he chose for his dwelling <line> <line>a high place with a view of nothing but east, <line> <line>the rows of waves impatient to crash on the boulders, <line> <line>where the storms might climb and burst over his reflections, <line> <line>and the fowls of the air become familiars. <line> <line>he set to work carting stones, gods gathered nearby <line> <line>harkening, making crowns of nettle, spears of bone, <line> <line>a cup from a gourd, and a dish. each day his dwelling <line> <line>grew higher, like a hive for bees, a dome, a cranium. <line> <line>one day, it was the solstice, a final stone <line> <line>closed the fontanel. the votary moved in. <line> <line>he gathered the crowns and spears, the cup and dish <line> <line>and laid out the new table for his guests. <line> <line>would the gods sit down beside at his first supper? <line> <line>he looked for them, he called out praising their names. <line> <line>they had all gone off somewhere. there was nowhere to go! <line> <line>the tide was full and even the deep route hither <line> <line>had gone under waves, the mainland had vanished in fog. <line> <line>he sat alone at his table. he sat alone. <line> <line>the gods who had brought him were gone. he started counting <line> <line>day one was the day when things began to go. <line> <line>he watched his shadow every morning, lengthening <line> <line>over the water, over the sand and stones, <line> <line>and being washed and parched like a piece of laundry <line> <line>until it was white as a nightshirt spread to dry <line> <line>on a gorse bush, fluttering a little, an empty sleeve, <line> <line>saying go on, go back, go on, go back <line> <line>the way waves do, the way the tides do, also, <line> <line>or simply wind blows and the tide says nothing at all. <line> <line>how clean the stones and the sand, the breaking waves, <line> <line>how clean the moonlight, the sunlight, and his lovely throat <line> <line>young and in love—is it still young and in love?— <line> <line>with the spirits, his voice pure as a bird's, but he's counting, <line> <line>the days are shortening, his voice is growing darker. <line> <line>surely they listen out and watch their votary <line> <line>there on the verge of the cliff in his careful dance <line> <line>like a gull whose wings are reliance, like a guillemot. <line> <line>so he chanted, he praised and danced, and it was the end <line> <line>of autumn. for the first time cold, he telt the bones in his flesh. <line> <line>above him, north, with terror he saw the lights <line> <line>and it was a human shadow that towered in them, <line> <line>a man on a cross, a man with a cross inside him <line> <line>instead of a skeleton; the cross was still and shimmered <line> <line>as if it held its breath so as to observe him. <line> <line>he was trembling, he saw the ghostly limbs <line> <line>behind the bright-dim curtain, those long wired veins <line> <line>through which pulse flickered and the wine flowed, <line> <line>the chest breathed with almost no sound at all. <line> <line>this figure had nothing to do with the gods who brought him, <line> <line>tugged at his heart, took their leave when most he needed. <line> <line>this looked like the son of the god he had sought to elude, <line> <line>now a giant surveying a world and a singular man <line> <line>abandoned by everything he'd served, but nonetheless <line> <line>dancing and shivering above the scrum of waves. <line> <line>cities had grown on the mainland meanwhile, monks and priors, <line> <line>grew fat;

while the cock with lively din, scatters the rear of darkness thin, and to the stack, or the barn door, stoutly struts his dames before; oft list'ning how the hounds and horn cheerly rouse the slumb'ring morn, from the side of some hoar hill, through the high wood echoing shrill. sometime walking, not unseen, by hedge-row elms, on hillocks green, right against the eastern gate, where the great sun begins his state, rob'd in flames, and amber light, the clouds in thousand liveries dight. while the ploughman near at hand, whistles o'er the furrow'd land, and the milkmaid singeth blithe, and the mower whets his scythe, and every shepherd tells his tale under the hawthorn in the dale. straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures whilst the landskip round it measures, russet lawns, and fallows gray, where the nibbling flocks do stray; mountains on whose barren breast the labouring clouds do often rest; meadows trim with daisies pied, shallow brooks, and rivers wide. towers, and battlements it sees bosom'd high in tufted trees, where perhaps some beauty lies, the cynosure of neighbouring eyes. hard by, a cottage chimney smokes, from betwixt two aged oaks, where corydon and thyrsis met, are at their savoury dinner set of herbs, and other country messes, which the neat-handed phyllis dresses; and then in haste her bow'r she leaves, with thestylis to bind the sheaves; or if the earlier season lead to the tann'd haycock in the mead. sometimes with secure delight the upland hamlets will invite, when the merry bells ring round, and the jocund rebecks sound to many a youth, and many a maid, dancing in the chequer'd shade; and young and old come forth to play on a sunshine holiday, till the live-long daylight fail; then to the spicy nut-brown ale, with stories told of many a feat, how faery mab the junkets eat, she was pinch'd and pull'd she said, and he by friar's lanthorn led, tells how the drudging goblin sweat, to earn his cream-bowl duly set, when in one night, ere glimpse of morn, his shadowy flail hath thresh'd the corn that ten day-labourers could not end; then lies him down, the lubber fiend, and stretch'd out all the chimney's length, basks at the fire his hairy strength; and crop-full out of doors he flings, ere the first cock his matin rings. thus done the tales, to bed they creep, by whispering winds soon lull'd asleep. tower'd cities please us then, and the busy hum of men, where throngs of knights and barons bold, in weeds of peace high triumphs hold, with store of ladies, whose bright eyes rain influence, and judge the prize of wit, or arms, while both contend to win her grace, whom all commend. there let hymen oft appear in saffron robe, with taper clear, and pomp, and feast, and revelry, with mask, and antique pageantry; such sights as youthful poets dream on summer eves by haunted stream. then to the well-trod stage anon, if jonson's learned sock be on, or sweetest shakespeare, fancy's child, warble his native wood-notes wild. and ever against eating cares, lap me in soft lydian airs, married to immortal verse, such as the meeting soul may pierce in notes with many a winding bout of linked sweetness long drawn out, with wanton heed, and giddy cunning, the melting voice through mazes running, untwisting all the chains that tie the hidden soul of harmony; that orpheus' self may heave his head from golden slumber on a bed of heap'd elysian flow'rs, and hear such strains as would have won the ear of pluto, to have quite set free his half-regain'd eurydice. these delights if thou canst give, mirth, with thee i mean to live. <line>","nature,landscapes & pastorals,mythology & folklore,greek & roman mythology,heroes & patriotism"

<line> <line>the verandah tracked with mud, and the cacao litter. <line> <line>mrs. s. upset by the mess. twelve hundred cacaos planted. <line> <line>joe, my son-in-law, planted his thousandth tree today. <line> <line>the tree onions make large bulbs but don’t want to seed. <line> <line>most vigorous: sunflower, watermelon—weeds! <line> <line>the jelly from berries out of the bush is delicious; <line> <line>lovely perfume from massoi, citron, vanilla, and gum. <line> <line>the peanuts are weeded while joe plays on his flute. <line> <line>i plant cabbage by moonlight, set out more cacao. <line> <line>the heart of a death’s-head moth beats a tattoo in my hand. <line> <line>planted coffee all day, and breadfruit, five beauties ... <line> <line>planted coffee the better part of the day, eight plants. <line> <line>in the nursery, three times that many. planted coffee ... <line> <line>painted the storm shutters. planted coffee all morning. <line> <line>i found a heap of old bones in a bush near the sty; <line> <line>two heads and a body: a warrior died with his prize. <line> <line>louis gave the bones a funeral and a burial. <line> <line>a series of hurricanes: louis writes to the times <line> <line>of “the foul colonial politics.” i send to new york for seeds: <line> <line>southern cross cabbage, eggplant, sweet potato <line> <line>and two thousand custard apples. louis’ own seed, david balfour, is growing. i wrote nothing <line> <line>from june till the end of this year; too busy planting. <line> <line>the samoan princes are getting nearer to war. <line> <line>it pains me to write this: my son-in-law has gone native <line> <line>in a spectacular way. belle is divorcing him. <line> <line>austin, my grandson, is in school in monterey. <line> <line>i have not, i believe, mentioned mrs. stevenson recently. <line> <line>she has gone back to scotland. the first breadfruit bore. <line> <line>belle and i go on sketching expeditions <line> <line>to the hostile samoan camps, stop in town for ginger beer. <line> <line>mr. haggard begged us to stay in town <line> <line>because he bitterly wanted women to protect. <line> <line>i suggested to him that i and my daughter <line> <line>could hide under his table and hand him cartridges <line> <line>at the window, to complete the romantic effect. <line> <line>it is clear that mr. haggard is ryder’s brother! <line> <line>he said, “you’d sell your life for a bunch of banana trees.” <line> <line>i’ve given permission to most of the “boys” <line> <line>to go to the races. lloyd has put up the lawn tennis things. <line> <line>mr. gurr, the neighbor, rushes in to say war has begun. <line> <line>we all race to the mission. eleven heads have been taken. <line> <line>later: mr. dine’s cousin received a head smeared with black <line> <line>(the custom is to return them to the bereaved). <line> <line>he washed it off and discovered it was his brother. <line> <line>he sat there, holding his brother’s head in his hands, <line> <line>kissing it, bathing it with his tears. a scandal arose <line> <line>because the heads of three girls have been taken as well <line> <line>(unheard of before in samoa), returned wrapped in silk to their kin. <line> <line>at malie, the warriors danced a head-hunter’s pantomime; <line> <line>the men who had taken heads carried great lumps of raw pork <line> <line>between their teeth, cut in the semblance of heads. <line> <line>i stopped writing this. too hysterical with migraine. <line> <line>also, people find where i hide it, and strike things out. <line> <line>our favorite chief is exiled for life. the war winds down. <line> <line>louis works on his masterpiece, the weir of hermiston. <line> <line>well, i’ve kept him alive for eight more years, <line> <line>while his dear friends would have condemned him to fog and rain <line> <line>so they might enjoy his glorious talk in london, <line> <line>though it be the end of him. fine friends! except for james. <line> <line>later: at six, louis helped with the mayonnaise, <line> <line>when he put both hands to his head, said, “oh, what a pain! <line> <line>do i look strange?” i said no, not wanting to frighten him. <line> <line>he was never conscious again. in two hours he died. <line> <line>tonight, the chiefs with their axes are digging a path <line> <line>to the top of the mountain. they will dig his grave. <line> <line>i will leave here as soon as i can, and never return, <line> <line>except to be buried beside him. i will live like a gipsy <line> <line>in my wild, ragged clothes, until i am old, old. <line> <line>i will have pretty gardens wherever i am, <line> <line>but never breadfruit, custard apples, grenadilla, cacao, <line> <line>pineapple, ylang-ylang, citron, mango, cacao, <line> <line>never again succumb to the fever of planting. <line>","activities,gardening,social commentaries,history & politics"

although not feminine, she was maternal. then that thought passed. she shrugged and comforted herself. difficult, celibate, implacable, a final time she assessed the couple of compromised want, aware that nothing blackens the heart like a mariage blanc, and stamped them — mwah! mwah! — with the imprimatur of two kisses each. the relationship lasted three months. they had chosen wrongly, and plausibly they fell apart, like the couple in godard’s le mépris. had she wanted more than a cover? had he covered more than he wanted? the heart, behind its casements, is faceted, pronged, coveted, intricate and known by few. he could not be kept. she withdrew her money. reconciliation occurred after they ceased speaking. on their last night in monaco, she turned to him and wondered if her life had meant anything. he did not answer: he had developed a grace for offering himself to those who found truth difficult. when they left the restaurant, she paid using a heavy, black american express card. each took a doggy bag and smelled of cooked meat. this alignment of opposite sexes had provided solace, and for a time, each had assumed a place, discerned a way to live. indeed, they lived on, never to see each other again, both aware the one had harmed the other: whether intended or not, the act could not be undone. what they recalled, when they recalled, was often wrong, or was it that so much went wrong and that was why they kept recalling? at the mention of monaco, they recounted certain adornments — agapanthus purpling, old men playing boules, and blue yachts tilting on a malachite sea, or were they malachite yachts tilting on a blue sea? wherever they went henceforth — the hôtel du cap, the boboli gardens, or even simple, small places in america — their minds would inexorably turn, and then return, to that interval in monaco, where they saw the truth and the truth was . . . monaco, monaco — frivolous, ridiculous, miniscule principality. it was there they came to know how dangerous beauty could be, how one could disappear into it, and with that dark knowledge they traveled on. each, in their separate lives, always mentioned monaco with deference, out of shyness, yes, but also shame, and that need to abridge the past. do you recognize them? they were not a couple, but they were a pair. tonight the sea pushes against monaco. jewelry store owners don white gloves, lock their doors. the principality has long forgotten the pair. baronesses, marchionesses, and princesses have had their portraits painted and affixed to walls. the narrow, dead-end streets embed themselves into the escarpments like bobby pins. the moon spreads her cape of baubles across the sea with glamorous transience, enlarging behind the dollhouse casino, banks, hotels, feeling into the rooms, fingering the miniatures. <line>","relationships,men & women,social commentaries,cities & urban life"

is there any need, with all your fame, for one more glorious deed? have you not slain enough bold foes by now, and must you have fresh laurels for your brow? matamore it's true, i'm restless, and i can't decide which of two foes should first be nullified— the mogul emperor or the persian sophy. clindor ah, let them live a while, sir. neither trophy would add a great deal to your fame and standing. and where's the army that you'd be commanding? matamore army? ah, villain, coward, do you doubt that with this arm alone i'd wipe them out? the mere sound of my name makes ramparts yield, and drives divisions from the battlefield; my wrath against these rulers needs engage only a piddling portion of my rage; with one commandment given to the fates i oust the strongest monarchs from their states; thunder's my cannon; my troops, the destinies; one blow lays low a thousand enemies; one breath, and all their hopes go up in smoke. yet you dare speak of armies! what a joke! no longer shall a second mars employ you; with but a glance, you rogue, i shall destroy you ... and yet the thought of her whom i adore softens me now, and i'm enraged no more; that little archer, whom every god obeys, forbids my eyes to glare with lethal rays. observe how my ferocity, which hates and hacks and slaughters, gently dissipates when i recall my lady, and my face is changed by thoughts of beauty, love, and grace. clindor oh, sir, you have a hundred selves or more; you're as handsome now as you were grim before. i can't imagine any lady who could stubbornly refuse her heart to you. matamore whatever i may have said, feel no alarm: sometimes i terrify, sometimes i charm; depending on my humor, i inspire men with anxiety, women with desire. before i had the power to suppress my beauty, women gave me much distress: when i appeared, they swooned in quantity, and thousands died each day for love of me. with every princess i had many a tryst, and every queen came begging to be kissed; the ethiopian and the japanese murmured my name in all their sighs and pleas. two sultanesses could not but adore me, two more escaped from the seraglio fòr me, which strained my friendship with the turkish nation. clindor their anger could but gild your reputation. matamore still, all that was more trouble than it was worth. it balked my plans for conquering the earth. what's more, i tired of it, and to deter such nuisances sent word to jupiter that if he could not put a stop to these fond women and their importunities, i'd rise up in a rage and end his reign as ruler of the gods, and would obtain for mars the right to throw his bolts of thunder. needless to say, the coward knuckled under: he did as i desired, and now, you see, i'm handsome only when i choose to be. clindor what love notes you'd receive, were that not so! matamore don't bring me any ... unless from her, you know. what does she say of me? clindor today she said that you inspire all hearts with love and dread, and that if what you promise her comes true, she'll feel herself a goddess, thanks to you. matamore back in the times i've just been speaking of, goddesses, also, pestered me for love, and i shall tell you of a strange event which caused confusion without precedent and threw all nature into disarray. the sun was powerless to rise one day because that bright, much-worshipped deity could not find where the dawn, his guide, might be. he sought her everywhere, in cephalus' bower, in old tithonus' bed, in memnon's tower, but since aurora nowhere was in sight, the day, till noontide, was as black as night. clindor where was the goddess, during these alarms? matamore in my bedchamber, offering me her charms. but she gained nothing by such shameless actions; my heart was blind to all her bright attractions, and all she got by showing off her beauty was a firm command to go and do her duty. clindor that curious story, sir, i now recall. i was in mexico, where i heard it all. they said that persia, vexed by the insult to their famous sun god, had it in for you. matamore i heard as much, and would have made them pay, but was in transylvania that day, where their ambassador hastened to appease my wrath with presents and apologies. clindor your brave heart showed them clemency. how fine! matamore just look, my friend, upon this face of mine. there every human virtue can be found. of all the foes i've stamped into the ground, whose kingdoms are annulled and cast aside, there was not one who did not fall through pride. but those who humbly honored my perfection have kept their power through a wise subjection. the modest kings of europe are all my vassals; i do not sack their towns or wreck their castles; i let them reign. but it's another story in africa, where i scorched the territory of certain kings who lacked humility, and left great deserts there for all to see. those endless sands, beneath those skies of fire, are a great monument to my righteous ire. clindor let us revert to love; your lady's here. matamore my cursèd rival's at her side, i fear. clindor where are you going? matamore he isn't brave, this dunce, and yet he's vain, and could be bold for once. perhaps he'll challenge me from foolish pride, merely because he's at the lady's side. clindor by doing so, the fool might come to harm. matamore i can't be valorous when i'm full of charm. clindor cease to be charming and be terrible, sir. matamore oh, you don't realize what that would incur. i can't be terrible by halves, you know; i'd slaughter both my mistress and my foe. until they part, let's stand aside and wait. clindor your prudence, like your valor, is very great.

10687,7230,"<line> <line>emily, a ship is floating in the harbour now, a wind is hovering o'er the mountain's brow; there is a path on the sea's azure floor, no keel has ever plough'd that path before; the halcyons brood around the foamless isles; the treacherous ocean has forsworn its wiles; the merry mariners are bold and free: say, my heart's sister, wilt thou sail with me? our bark is as an albatross, whose nest is a far eden of the purple east; and we between her wings will sit, while night, and day, and storm, and calm, pursue their flight, our ministers, along the boundless sea, treading each other's heels, unheededly. it is an isle under ionian skies, beautiful as a wreck of paradise, and, for the harbours are not safe and good, this land would have remain'd a solitude but for some pastoral people native there, who from the elysian, clear, and golden air draw the last spirit of the age of gold, simple and spirited; innocent and bold. the blue aegean girds this chosen home, with ever-changing sound and light and foam, kissing the sifted sands, and caverns hoar; and all the winds wandering along the shore undulate with the undulating tide: there are thick woods where sylvan forms abide; and many a fountain, rivulet and pond, as clear as elemental diamond, or serene morning air; and far beyond, the mossy tracks made by the goats and deer (which the rough shepherd treads but once a year) pierce into glades, caverns and bowers, and halls built round with ivy, which the waterfalls illumining, with sound that never fails accompany the noonday nightingales; and all the place is peopled with sweet airs; the light clear element which the isle wears is heavy with the scent of lemon-flowers, which floats like mist laden with unseen showers, and falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep; and from the moss violets and jonquils peep and dart their arrowy odour through the brain till you might faint with that delicious pain. and every motion, odour, beam and tone, with that deep music is in unison: which is a soul within the soul—they seem like echoes of an antenatal dream. it is an isle 'twixt heaven, air, earth and sea, cradled and hung in clear tranquillity; bright as that wandering eden lucifer, wash'd by the soft blue oceans of young air. it is a favour'd place. famine or blight, pestilence, war and earthquake, never light upon its mountain-peaks; blind vultures, they sail onward far upon their fatal way: the wingèd storms, chanting their thunder-psalm to other lands, leave azure chasms of calm over this isle, or weep themselves in dew, from which its fields and woods ever renew their green and golden immortality. and from the sea there rise, and from the sky there fall, clear exhalations, soft and bright, veil after veil, each hiding some delight, which sun or moon or zephyr draw aside, till the isle's beauty, like a naked bride glowing at once with love and loveliness, blushes and trembles at its own excess: yet, like a buried lamp, a soul no less burns in the heart of this delicious isle, an atom of th' eternal, whose own smile unfolds itself, and may be felt not seen o'er the gray rocks, blue waves and forests green, filling their bare and void interstices. but the chief marvel of the wilderness is a lone dwelling, built by whom or how none of the rustic island-people know: 'tis not a tower of strength, though with its height it overtops the woods; but, for delight, some wise and tender ocean-king, ere crime had been invented, in the world's young prime, rear'd it, a wonder of that simple time, an envy of the isles, a pleasure-house made sacred to his sister and his spouse. it scarce seems now a wreck of human art, but, as it were, titanic; in the heart of earth having assum'd its form, then grown out of the mountains, from the living stone, lifting itself in caverns light and high: for all the antique and learned imagery has been eras'd, and in the place of it the ivy and the wild-vine interknit the volumes of their many-twining stems; parasite flowers illume with dewy gems the lampless halls, and when they fade, the sky peeps through their winter-woof of tracery with moonlight patches, or star atoms keen, or fragments of the day's intense serene; working mosaic on their parian floors. and, day and night, aloof, from the high towers and terraces, the earth and ocean seem to sleep in one another's arms, and dream of waves, flowers, clouds, woods, rocks, and all that we read in their smiles, and call reality. this isle and house are mine, and i have vow'd thee to be lady of the solitude. and i have fitted up some chambers there looking towards the golden eastern air, and level with the living winds, which flow like waves above the living waves below. i have sent books and music there, and all those instruments with which high spirits call the future from its cradle, and the past out of its grave, and make the present last in thoughts and joys which sleep, but cannot die, folded within their own eternity. our simple life wants little, and true taste hires not the pale drudge luxury to waste the scene it would adorn, and therefore still, nature with all her children haunts the hill. the ring-dove, in the embowering ivy, yet keeps up her love-lament, and the owls flit round the evening tower, and the young stars glance between the quick bats in their twilight dance; the spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight before our gate, and the slow, silent night is measur'd by the pants of their calm sleep. be this our home in life, and when years heap their wither'd hours, like leaves, on our decay, let us become the overhanging day, the living soul of this elysian isle, conscious, inseparable, one. meanwhile we two will rise, and sit, and walk together, under the roof of blue ionian weather, and wander in the meadows, or ascend the mossy mountains, where the blue heavens bend with lightest winds, to touch their paramour; or linger, where the pebble-paven shore, under the quick, faint kisses of the sea, trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy— possessing and possess'd by all that is within that calm circumference of bliss, and by each other, till to love and live be one: or, at the noontide hour, arrive where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep the moonlight of the expir'd night asleep, through which the awaken'd day can never peep; a veil for our seclusion, close as night's, where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights; sleep, the fresh dew of languid love, the rain whose drops quench kisses till they burn again. and we will talk, until thought's melody become too sweet for utterance, and it die in words, to live again in looks, which dart with thrilling tone into the voiceless heart, harmonizing silence without a sound. our breath shall intermix, our bosoms bound, and our veins beat together; and our lips with other eloquence than words, eclipse the soul that burns between them, and the wells which boil under our being's inmost cells, the fountains of our deepest life, shall be confus'd in passion's golden purity, as mountain-springs under the morning sun. we shall become the same, we shall be one spirit within two frames, oh! wherefore two? one passion in twin-hearts, which grows and grew, till like two meteors of expanding flame, those spheres instinct with it become the same, touch, mingle, are transfigur'd; ever still burning, yet ever inconsumable: in one another's substance finding food, like flames too pure and light and unimbu'd to nourish their bright lives with baser prey, which point to heaven and cannot pass away: one hope within two wills, one will beneath two overshadowing minds, one life, one death, one heaven, one hell, one immortality, and one annihilation. woe is me! the winged words on which my soul would pierce into the height of love's rare universe, are chains of lead around its flight of fire— i pant, i sink, i tremble, i expire! <line>","living,marriage & companionship,activities,travels & journeys,nature,landscapes & pastorals,seas, rivers, & streams,mythology & folklore,engagement"

(just sixteen, the kid at the station will quote her as saying, ""what a pity you have to work today! it's not right... what weather! goodness, what a night it'll be!"" he'll add: ""she sure was pretty."") was there a change of plan? why the stop for gas? possibly she'd not yet made up her mind? or had made it up but not yet settled on a place? or could it be she knew where she was headed, what she would do— and wanted to make sure the car ran for hours afterward? might the car not be, then, a sort of beacon, a lighthouse- in-reverse, meant to direct one not away from but toward the shore and its broken boulders, there to spot the bobbing white flag of a blouse? her brief note, which will appear in the local leader, contains a phrase (""she chanted snatches of old lands"") that will muddle the town for three days, until a professor e. h. wade pins it to ophelia—and reprimands the police, who, this but goes to show, have not the barest knowledge of shakespeare, else would never have misread ""lauds"" as ""lands."" a detective gregg messing will answer, tersely, ""afraid it's not our bailiwick. missing persons, yes; missing poems, no."" (what's truly tragic's never allowed to stand alone for long, of course. at each moment there's a crowd of clowns pressing in: the booming ass at every wake who, angling a loud necktie in the chip dip, airs his problems with intestinal gas, or the blow-dried bonehead out to sell siding to the grieving mother . . . . well, wade sent the leader another briefword: ""decades of service to the bard now force me to amend the girl's little slip. 'chaunted' not 'chanted' is the preferred . . ."") yet none of her unshakeable entourage —pedants, pundits, cops without a clue, and a yearning young grease-monkey—are alerted yet. still the empty car idles, idles on the cliff, and night isn't falling so much as day is floating out to sea . . . . soon, whether she's found or not, her lights will draw moths and tiny dark-winged things that might be dirt-clumps, ashes. come what may, the night will be lovely, as she foresaw, the first stars easing through the blue, engine and ocean breathing together. <line>","living,death,nature,seas, rivers, & streams,arts & sciences,poetry & poets"

(still here i carry my old delicious burdens, i carry them, men and women, i carry them with me wherever i go, i swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them, i am fill’d with them, and i will fill them in return.) 2 you road i enter upon and look around, i believe you are not all that is here, i believe that much unseen is also here. here the profound lesson of reception, nor preference nor denial, the black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas’d, the illiterate person, are not denied; the birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar’s tramp, the drunkard’s stagger, the laughing party of mechanics, the escaped youth, the rich person’s carriage, the fop, the eloping couple, the early market-man, the hearse, the moving of furniture into the town, the return back from the town, they pass, i also pass, any thing passes, none can be interdicted, none but are accepted, none but shall be dear to me. 3 you air that serves me with breath to speak! you objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them shape! you light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable showers! you paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides! i believe you are latent with unseen existences, you are so dear to me. you flagg’d walks of the cities! you strong curbs at the edges! you ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timber-lined sides! you distant ships! you rows of houses! you window-pierc’d façades! you roofs! you porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards! you windows whose transparent shells might expose so much! you doors and ascending steps! you arches! you gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden crossings! from all that has touch’d you i believe you have imparted to yourselves, and now would impart the same secretly to me, from the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive surfaces, and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable with me. 4 the earth expanding right hand and left hand, the picture alive, every part in its best light, the music falling in where it is wanted, and stopping where it is not wanted, the cheerful voice of the public road, the gay fresh sentiment of the road. o highway i travel, do you say to me do not leave me? do you say venture not—if you leave me you are lost? do you say i am already prepared, i am well-beaten and undenied, adhere to me? o public road, i say back i am not afraid to leave you, yet i love you, you express me better than i can express myself, you shall be more to me than my poem. i think heroic deeds were all conceiv’d in the open air, and all free poems also, i think i could stop here myself and do miracles, i think whatever i shall meet on the road i shall like, and whoever beholds me shall like me, i think whoever i see must be happy. 5 from this hour i ordain myself loos’d of limits and imaginary lines, going where i list, my own master total and absolute, listening to others, considering well what they say, pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating, gently,but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that would hold me. i inhale great draughts of space, the east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are mine. i am larger, better than i thought, i did not know i held so much goodness. all seems beautiful to me, i can repeat over to men and women you have done such good to me i would do the same to you, i will recruit for myself and you as i go, i will scatter myself among men and women as i go, i will toss a new gladness and roughness among them, whoever denies me it shall not trouble me, whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me. 6 now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me, now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear’d it would not astonish me. now i see the secret of the making of the best persons, it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth. here a great personal deed has room, (such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men, its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all authority and all argument against it.) here is the test of wisdom, wisdom is not finally tested in schools, wisdom cannot be pass’d from one having it to another not having it, wisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own proof, applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content, is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and the excellence of things; something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes it out of the soul. now i re-examine philosophies and religions, they may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at all under the spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents. here is realization, here is a man tallied—he realizes here what he has in him, the past, the future, majesty, love—if they are vacant of you, you are vacant of them. only the kernel of every object nourishes; where is he who tears off the husks for you and me? where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me? here is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion’d, it is apropos; do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers? do you know the talk of those turning eye-balls? 7 here is the efflux of the soul, the efflux of the soul comes from within through embower’d gates, ever provoking questions, these yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness why are they? why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight expands my blood? why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank? why are there trees i never walk under but large and melodious thoughts descend upon me? (i think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always drop fruit as i pass;) what is it i interchange so suddenly with strangers? what with some driver as i ride on the seat by his side? what with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as i walk by and pause? what gives me to be free to a woman’s and man’s good-will? what gives them to be free to mine? 8 the efflux of the soul is happiness, here is happiness, i think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times, now it flows unto us, we are rightly charged. here rises the fluid and attaching character, the fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of man and woman, (the herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day out of the roots of themselves, than it sprouts fresh and sweet continually out of itself.) toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the love of young and old, from it falls distill’d the charm that mocks beauty and attainments, toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact. 9 allons! whoever you are come travel with me! traveling with me you find what never tires. the earth never tires, the earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first, nature is rude and incomprehensible at first, be not discouraged, keep on, there are divine things well envelop’d, i swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can tell. allons! we must not stop here, however sweet these laid-up stores, however convenient this dwelling we cannot remain here, however shelter’d this port and however calm these waters we must not anchor here, however welcome the hospitality that surrounds us we are permitted to receive it but a little while. 10 allons! the inducements shall be greater, we will sail pathless and wild seas, we will go where winds blow, waves dash, and the yankee clipper speeds by under full sail. allons! with power, liberty, the earth, the elements, health, defiance, gayety, self-esteem, curiosity; allons! from all formules! from your formules, o bat-eyed and materialistic priests. the stale cadaver blocks up the passage—the burial waits no longer. allons! yet take warning! he traveling with me needs the best blood, thews, endurance, none may come to the trial till he or she bring courage and health, come not here if you have already spent the best of yourself, only those may come who come in sweet and determin’d bodies, no diseas’d person, no rum-drinker or venereal taint is permitted here. (i and mine do not convince by arguments, similes, rhymes, we convince by our presence.) 11 listen! i will be honest with you, i do not offer the old smooth prizes, but offer rough new prizes, these are the days that must happen to you: you shall not heap up what is call’d riches, you shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve, you but arrive at the city to which you were destin’d, you hardly settle yourself to satisfaction before you are call’d by an irresistible call to depart, you shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those who remain behind you, what beckonings of love you receive you shall only answer with passionate kisses of parting, you shall not allow the hold of those who spread their reach’d hands toward you. 12 allons! after the great companions, and to belong to them! they too are on the road—they are the swift and majestic men—they are the greatest women, enjoyers of calms of seas and storms of seas, sailors of many a ship, walkers of many a mile of land, habituès of many distant countries, habituès of far-distant dwellings, trusters of men and women, observers of cities, solitary toilers, pausers and contemplators of tufts, blossoms, shells of the shore, dancers at wedding-dances, kissers of brides, tender helpers of children, bearers of children, soldiers of revolts, standers by gaping graves, lowerers-down of coffins, journeyers over consecutive seasons, over the years, the curious years each emerging from that which preceded it, journeyers as with companions, namely their own diverse phases, forth-steppers from the latent unrealized baby-days, journeyers gayly with their own youth, journeyers with their bearded and well-grain’d manhood, journeyers with their womanhood, ample, unsurpass’d, content, journeyers with their own sublime old age of manhood or womanhood, old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth of the universe, old age, flowing free with the delicious near-by freedom of death. 13 allons! to that which is endless as it was beginningless, to undergo much, tramps of days, rests of nights, to merge all in the travel they tend to, and the days and nights they tend to, again to merge them in the start of superior journeys, to see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it and pass it, to conceive no time, however distant, but what you may reach it and pass it, to look up or down no road but it stretches and waits for you, however long but it stretches and waits for you, to see no being, not god’s or any, but you also go thither, to see no possession but you may possess it, enjoying all without labor or purchase, abstracting the feast yet not abstracting one particle of it, to take the best of the farmer’s farm and the rich man’s elegant villa, and the chaste blessings of the well-married couple, and the fruits of orchards and flowers of gardens, to take to your use out of the compact cities as you pass through, to carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever you go, to gather the minds of men out of their brains as you encounter them, to gather the love out of their hearts, to take your lovers on the road with you, for all that you leave them behind you, to know the universe itself as a road, as many roads, as roads for traveling souls. all parts away for the progress of souls, all religion, all solid things, arts, governments—all that was or is apparent upon this globe or any globe, falls into niches and corners before the procession of souls along the grand roads of the universe. of the progress of the souls of men and women along the grand roads of the universe, all other progress is the needed emblem and sustenance. forever alive, forever forward, stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn, baffled, mad, turbulent, feeble, dissatisfied, desperate, proud, fond, sick, accepted by men, rejected by men, they go! they go! i know that they go, but i know not where they go, but i know that they go toward the best—toward something great. whoever you are, come forth! or man or woman come forth! you must not stay sleeping and dallying there in the house, though you built it, or though it has been built for you. out of the dark confinement! out from behind the screen! it is useless to protest, i know all and expose it. behold through you as bad as the rest, through the laughter, dancing, dining, supping, of people, inside of dresses and ornaments, inside of those wash’d and trimm’d faces, behold a secret silent loathing and despair. no husband, no wife, no friend, trusted to hear the confession, another self, a duplicate of every one, skulking and hiding it goes, formless and wordless through the streets of the cities, polite and bland in the parlors, in the cars of railroads, in steamboats, in the public assembly, home to the houses of men and women, at the table, in the bedroom, everywhere, smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright, death under the breast-bones, hell under the skull-bones, under the broadcloth and gloves, under the ribbons and artificial flowers, keeping fair with the customs, speaking not a syllable of itself, speaking of any thing else but never of itself. 14 allons! through struggles and wars! the goal that was named cannot be countermanded. have the past struggles succeeded? what has succeeded? yourself? your nation? nature? now understand me well—it is provided in the essence of things that from any fruition of success, no matter what, shall come forth something to make a greater struggle necessary. my call is the call of battle, i nourish active rebellion, he going with me must go well arm’d, he going with me goes often with spare diet, poverty, angry enemies, desertions. 15 allons! the road is before us! it is safe—i have tried it—my own feet have tried it well—be not detain’d! let the paper remain on the desk unwritten, and the book on the shelf unopen’d! let the tools remain in the workshop! let the money remain unearn’d! let the school stand! mind not the cry of the teacher! let the preacher preach in his pulpit! let the lawyer plead in the court, and the judge expound the law. camerado, i give you my hand! i give you my love more precious than money, i give you myself before preaching or law; will you give me yourself? will you come travel with me? shall we stick by each other as long as we live? <line>","activities,travels & journeys"

when soft the western breezes blow, and strolling youths meet sauntering maids, i love to watch the stirring trades beneath the vallombrosa shades our much-enduring elms bestow; the vender and his rhetoric’s flow, that lambent stream of liquid lies; the bait he dangles from his line, the gudgeon and his gold-washed prize. i halt before the blazoned sign that bids me linger to admire the drama time can never tire, the little hero of the hunch, with iron arm and soul of fire, and will that works his fierce desire,— untamed, unscared, unconquered punch! my ear a pleasing torture finds in tones the withered sibyl grinds,— the dame sans merci’s broken strain, whom i erewhile, perchance, have known, when orleans filled the bourbon throne, a siren singing by the seine. but most i love the tube that spies the orbs celestial in their march; that shows the comet as it whisks its tail across the planets’ disks, as if to blind their blood-shot eyes; or wheels so close against the sun we tremble at the thought of risks our little spinning ball may run, to pop like corn that children parch, from summer something overdone, and roll, a cinder, through the skies. grudge not to-day the scanty fee to him who farms the firmament, to whom the milky way is free; who holds the wondrous crystal key, the silent open sesame that science to her sons has lent; who takes his toll, and lifts the bar that shuts the road to sun and star. if venus only comes to time, (and prophets say she must and shall,) to-day will hear the tinkling chime of many a ringing silver dime, for him whose optic glass supplies the crowd with astronomic eyes,— the galileo of the mall. dimly the transit morning broke; the sun seemed doubting what to do, as one who questions how to dress, and takes his doublets from the press, and halts between the old and new. please heaven he wear his suit of blue, or don, at least, his ragged cloak, with rents that show the azure through! i go the patient crowd to join that round the tube my eyes discern, the last new-comer of the file, and wait, and wait, a weary while, and gape, and stretch, and shrug, and smile, (for each his place must fairly earn, hindmost and foremost, in his turn,) till hitching onward, pace by pace, i gain at last the envied place, and pay the white exiguous coin: the sun and i are face to face; he glares at me, i stare at him; and lo! my straining eye has found a little spot that, black and round, lies near the crimsoned fire-orb’s rim. o blessed, beauteous evening star, well named for her whom earth adores,— the lady of the dove-drawn car,— i know thee in thy white simar; but veiled in black, a rayless spot, blank as a careless scribbler’s blot, stripped of thy robe of silvery flame,— the stolen robe that night restores when day has shut his golden doors,— i see thee, yet i know thee not; and canst thou call thyself the same? a black, round spot,—and that is all; and such a speck our earth would be if he who looks upon the stars through the red atmosphere of mars could see our little creeping ball across the disk of crimson crawl as i our sister planet see. and art thou, then, a world like ours, flung from the orb that whirled our own a molten pebble from its zone? how must thy burning sands absorb the fire-waves of the blazing orb, thy chain so short, thy path so near, thy flame-defying creatures hear the maelstroms of the photosphere! and is thy bosom decked with flowers that steal their bloom from scalding showers? and hast thou cities, domes, and towers, and life, and love that makes it dear, and death that fills thy tribes with fear? lost in my dream, my spirit soars through paths the wandering angels know; my all-pervading thought explores the azure ocean’s lucent shores; i leave my mortal self below, as up the star-lit stairs i climb, and still the widening view reveals in endless rounds the circling wheels that build the horologe of time. new spheres, new suns, new systems gleam; the voice no earth-born echo hears steals softly on my ravished ears: i hear them “singing as they shine”— a mortal’s voice dissolves my dream: my patient neighbor, next in line, hints gently there are those who wait. o guardian of the starry gate, what coin shall pay this debt of mine? too slight thy claim, too small the fee that bids thee turn the potent key the tuscan’s hand has placed in thine. forgive my own the small affront, the insult of the proffered dime; take it, o friend, since this thy wont, but still shall faithful memory be a bankrupt debtor unto thee, and pay thee with a grateful rhyme. <line>","nature,stars, planets, heavens,arts & sciences,sciences,social commentaries,cities & urban life"

the prince god loves!” see teucer’s bow. hear teucer’s: “this time lucky.” his— but this time it was not our father, god, who saved your life, my prince. as agamemnon cried: “the ships are safe. stand at the riverside’s far bank.” teléspiax heard the rustle of lord teucer’s shot and stood between yourself and it. his head was opened, egglike, at the back, mucked with thick blood, blood trickling from his mouth. his last words were: “prince, your trumpeter has lost his breath.” “our worst fear was his face would fade,” teléspiax’s father said. “but it did not. we will remember it until we die.” “give his instrument to hogem,” hector said, and went— lutie on reins—between the sea and snow, throwing his chariots wide, scamánderwards, as easily as others might a cloak. diomed among this traffic, on his own, among his dead, their pools of blood, their cut-off body-parts, their cut-off heads, ashamed as his head cleared to see odysseus, idomeneo, the ajax—big and small— whipping away downslope, shouting towards odysseus: “where are you going with your back to the battle?” who shouted back, although he did not turn: “look left!” and there was lutie driving hector onto him, sure they would trample him, for sure queen hera’s human, diomed, would stand and die, except: “arms up, young king—” nestor, full tilt, reins round his tummy, leaning out “—and jump . . .” wrists locked “. . . you young are just . . .” swinging him up onto the plate “. . . too much.” “with your permission, da?” nod. drew. then threw the chariot’s javelin as lutie spun his wheels, and hector threw— those skewers trading brilliance as they passed— and missed—both vehicles slither-straightening, regaining speed, close, close, then driven apart by empty cars careering off the incline, or stationary cars, their horses cropping grass. “daddy, go slow. hector will say i ran.” “but not the widows you have made.” and slow and low cruising the blue above this mix heaven’s queen and ringsight-eyed athena trumpeting down huge worms of sound as hector’s car rereached king nestor’s, and: “what kept you, prince?” diomed offered as they came abreast: “you went for a refreshing towel?” and threw his axe, that toppled through the air, and, oh, hector, my hector, as you thought: “if heaven helps me heaven shows it loves the best,” parted your lutie’s mesh and smashed into his heart. what did you say as god called you to death dear lutie? “king prince, i leave you driverless.” and put the reins into his hands, and fled into oblivion as hector with his other hand held what his lutie was, upright, face forwards, in between the chariot’s basket and himself, shouting as he drove after them: “loathsome greek, your loathsome hair, your loathsome blood, your loathsome breath, your loathsome heart, jump in your loathsome ships, i will come after you, come over the aegean after you, and find you though you hide inside your loathsome father’s grave and with my bare hands twist your loathsome head off your loathsome neck.” there was a greek called themion. mad about armour. if not armour, cars. of course he went to troy. and troy saw a stray spear transfix him as he drove. companionably, his horses galloped up on starlight’s side, and muddled starlight down, and bertie down, and brought the prince (still holding lutie) down, as all the world hurried, as if by windheads, on towards scamánder’s ford. hether you reach it from the palisade or through the trees that dot the incline’s last stretch you hear scamánder’s voice before you see what one may talk across on quiet days its rippling sunspangled breadth streaming across the bars of pebbly sand that form its ford —though on the fleet’s side deeper, darkly bright. and here tiptoeing from this bar to that, settling the cloudy sunshine of her hair, her towel retained by nothing save herself, the god of tops and thongs our lady aphrodité came, her eyes brimfull with tears. scamánder is astonished by his luck. “beauty of beauties, why are you weeping?” “i have been hurt, scamánder.” “no . . .” “humiliated.” “no . . .” “me. a god. just like yourself. touched . . .” “touched!” “by a man.” “a man!” “a greek.” “death to all greeks!” “he cut me!” “sacrilege! . . . but where?” “i need your healing touch.” “how can i help you if you do not show me where?” “moisten its lips and my wound will be healed.” “you must say where!” “well . . .” the towel has slipped an inch. “i am afraid you will be disappointed.” “never.” “are you sure?” “yes!” “you will not criticize me?” “no!” her wrist upturned. out-turned. her opened palm. fanning the fingers of her other hand, stroking his spangles with her fingertips. “goddess, i love you. i have always loved you. say that you love me. even a little. i beg you. god grant it.” “i need your help, scamánder.” “take pity on me. come into me.” “you have your nymphs.” “bores! bores!” “i might be nibbled by an eel!” “death to all eels!” the towel is down. “step into me . . . i love your toes . . . please let me kiss your toes . . . your little dinkum-inkum toes . . .” “no one has kissed them so nicely, scamánder.” “and now your knees . . .” “you tickle me . . .” “and now your thighs!” “oh, oh, go on . . .” “and now your bum! your holy bum! your sacred bum! the bum of paradise!” “oh, my scamánder, i must have your help . . .” “anything!” the towel goes curling off, and as she floated on his stream our lady aphrodité said: “at any moment now the greeks will reach your troy-side bank . . .” recall those sequences when horsemen ride out of the trees and down into a stream somewhere in kansas or missouri, say. so—save they were thousands—greece into scamánder’s ford. coming downstream, a smallish wave that passes but scamánder’s flow does not relapse. indeed almost without a sound its murmuring radiance rose into a dark, torrential surge, clouded with boulders, crammed with trees, as clamorous as if it were a sea, that lifted greece, then pulled greece down, cars gone, masks gone, gone under, reappearing, gone: “onto your knees! praise hector for this flood! the prince god loves!” prince hector claims as he comes through the trees. they do. then up and run, run, thousands of them, to hold those greeks who got back out under until their bubbles stopped; while those swept off turned somersaults amid scamánder’s undertow. the flat— 1000 yards of it between the river and the palisade. the king: “the lord has not abandoned us. to cross will be as bad for them.” but it was not to be as bad for them. indeed, as hector drove towards scamánder’s brink, and as—their banners rising one by one, one after one and then another one— he and all ilium began to enter it, the river reassumed its softly-spoken, smooth, sunspangled way. and agamemnon cried: “god, what are you for? what use are you to me?” as hector cries: “two miracles! your prince is close to god!” and hera to athena: “fog?” and fog came down. and most of greece got out. troy holding hands midstream. an army peering through its masks. miss tops and thongs to god: “your hera has . . .” and with a wish he turned the fog to light and with a word he called them back to heaven. sky. snow. the 1000 yards. the palisade. hector: “i am your prince. my name means he-who-holds. troy. and the plain. and now the ships. for troy!” his battle cry, rising into a common cry, that cry into a clamour, and that clamour to bayings of hatred. 800 yards. the child: “we are the greeks. we fight to win. if one is lost, close his eyes, step over him, and kill his enemy.” 800 yards. the greeks are tiring. nestor is on his knees: “god of all gods, most holy and most high, if greece has ever sacrificed fresh blood to you, protect our ships.” heaven. soft music. summertime. queen hera and athena? yes . . . some lesser gods observing their approach, approach, salaam, and then lead them— now both in black wraparound tops— to god: “darling daddy, here we are.” “and” (hera) “here we stay until you stop that worthless hector killing greeks.” up steps love. hera: “why is she wearing a tent?” love: “father, see this.” (her wrist.) “human strikes god! communism! the end of everything!” “darlings,” he said, “you know that being a god means being blamed. do this—no good. do that—the same. the answer is: avoid humanity. remember—i am god. i see the bigger picture.” “and i am hera, heaven’s queen, greece worships me.” “stuff greece,” love said. “your blubber-bummed wife with her gobstopper nipples hates troy because troy’s paris put her last when we stripped off for him. as for the ithacan boat-boy’s undercurved preceptatrix, she hates troy because my statue stands on its acropolis.” hera: “the cities’ whores were taxed to pay for it.” love (dropping onto her knees before himself): “please . . . stop them harming troy. the greatest city in the world.” while hera and athena sang: “cleavage! cleavage! queen of the foaming hole. mammoth or man or midge she sucks from pole to pole.” and god has had enough of it. lifting his scales he said: “hector will have his day of victory.” then crashed them to the ground. 700 yards. the palisade. its gate. late sunlight on gilt beaks. “there’s no escape from troy.” “or from the plain at troy.” begging for ransom, trojan hoti, his arms around king menelaos’ knees. king agamemnon: “off.” then he punched hoti in the face. then punched him in the face again. and then again. and when he fell king agamemnon kicked him in the groin. kicking him in the groin with so much force it took a step to follow up each kick. then pulled him up, then dragged him by his hair this way and that, then left him, calling: “finish him off.” and someone did. “i was sixteen. i said: ‘where is achilles?’ hard as it is to share another’s troubles when your own are pressing great ajax took my hands in his and said: ‘he loves us. he is with us. he will come.’” but he did not. then ajax to himself: “dear lord, you made me straight. give me the strength to last till dark.” the prince: “i get past everything i see. their war is lost.” it was. aenéas, ábassee, sarpédon, gray, calling to one another down the line. then, with a mighty wall of sound, as if a slope of stones rolled down into a lake of broken glass we ran at them. and now the light of evening has begun to shawl across the plain: blue gray, gold gray, blue gold, translucent nothingnesses readying our space, within the deep, unchanging sea of space, for hesper’s entrance, and the silver wrap. covered with blood, mostly their own, loyal to death, reckoning to die odysseus, ajax, diomed, idomeneo, nestor, menelaos and the king: “do not die because others have died.” “do not show them the palms of your hands.” “achil!” “achil!” “if he won’t help us, heaven help us.” “stand still and fight.” “feel shame in one another’s eyes.” “i curse you, god. you are a liar, god. troy will be yours by dark—immortal lies.” “home!” “home!” “there’s no such place.” “you can’t launch burning ships.” “more men survive if no one runs.” but that is what greece did. dropping their wounded, throwing down their dead, their shields, their spears, their swords, they ran. leaving their heroes tattered, filthy, torn and ran and ran above their cries: “i am the prince! the victory is mine!” chylábborak: “do not take cowardice for granted.” scarce had he said it, when his son, kykéon, standing next to him took ajax’ final spear cast in his chest. “i shall not wear your armour, sir,” he said. and died. “my son is dead.” the prince: “hector is loved by god.” and greece, a wall of walking swords, but walking backwards, leaving the plain in silence and in tears. idomeneo, running back out at those trojans who came too close: “you know my name. come look for me. and boy, the day you do will be the day you die.” hector to troy: “soldiers!— unmatched my force, unconquerable my will. after ten years of days, in one long day to be remembered for as many days as there are days to come, this is my day, your hector’s day. troy given back to troy. my day of victory!” and when the cheering died: “some say: destroy greece now. but i say no. out of your cars. eat by your fires. two hundred fires! around each fire five hundred men! “the sound of grindstones turning through the night, the firelight that stands between our blades, so let king agamemnon’s own hold hands and look into each other’s frightened eyes. “true god! great master of the widespread sky! if only you would turn me into a god, as you, through me, tomorrow by their ships will see greece die.” silence. a ring of lights. within immaculate in boat-cloaks lined with red king agamemnon’s lords— the depression of retreat. the depression of returning to camp. him at the centre of their circle sobbing, then shouting: “we must run for it!” dark glasses in parked cars. “king agamemnon of mycenae, god called, god raised, god recognized, you are a piece of shit,” diomed said. silence again. “let us praise god,” lord ajax said, “that hector stopped before he reached the ships.” silence again. then nestor (putting his knee back in): “paramount agamemnon, king of kings, lord of the shore, the islands and the sea i shall begin, and end, with you. greece needs good words. like them or not, the credit will be yours. determined. keen to fight, that is our diomed— as i should know. when just a boy of ten i fought blowback of missolonghi, a cannibal, drank blood, he captured you, he buggered you, you never walked again. but diomed lacks experience. god has saved us, momentarily. god loves achilles. you took, and you have kept, achilles’ ribband she.” “i was a fool!” “and now you must appease him, agamemnon. humble words. hands shaken. gifts.” the king—wiping his eyes: “as usual, pylos has said the only things worth hearing. i was mad to take the she. i shall pay fitting damages. plus her, i offer him the corfiot armour that my father wore.” silence. the sea. its whispering. “to which i add: a set of shields. posy, standard, ceremonial. the last, cut from the hide of a one ton lesbian bull.” silence. the sea. “and . . . a chariot! from my own équipe! they smoke along the ground . . . they ride its undulations like a breeze . . .” the sea. “plus: six horses—saddled, bridled and caparisoned, their grooms and veterinarians . . . . . . and six tall shes: two good dancers, two good stitchers, two good cooks. all capable of bearing boys . . . “oh, very well then: twenty loaves of gold, the same of silver, and the same of iron.” masks. lights. behind the lords some hundreds from the army have walked up. lord nestor smiles. lord menelaos smiles. “plus— though it may well reduce your king to destitution: a’kimi’kúriex, my summer palace by the argive sea, its lawns, its terraces, its curtains in whose depths larks dive above a field of waving lilies and fishscale-breakers shatter on blue rocks. then, as he draws their silky heights aside, standing among huge chests of looted booty, long necked, with lowered lids, but candid eyes, my living daughter, íphaniss, a diamond big as a cheeseball for her belly stud. his wife to be! minus—i need not say—her otherwise huge bride-price.” “more!” “more!” “more!” lord ajax almost has to hold him up. “the whole of eastern pel’po’nesia— an area of outstanding natural beauty— its cities, epi’dávros, trów’é’zen, their fortresses, their harbours and their fleets, their taxpayers—glad to accept his modest ways— all this, the greatest benefaction ever known, if he agrees to fight. and he admits i am his king.” instantly, nestor: “an offer god himself could not refuse. all that remains to say is: who shall take it to achilles?” agamemnon: “you will.” starlight. the starlight on the sea. the sea. its whispering mixed with the prayers of ajax and of nestor as they walk along the shore towards achilles’ gate. “my lords?” “your lord.” “this way.” they find him, with guitar, singing of gilgamesh. “take my hands. here they are.” you cannot take your eyes away from him. his own so bright they slow you down. his voice so low, and yet so clear. you know that he is dangerous. “patroclus? friends in need. still, friends. that has not changed, i think. autómedon? wine. “dear lord and master of the widespread sky, accept ourselves, accept our prayers.” their cups are taken. “father friend?” king nestor (for his life): “you know why we are here. we face death. the mass choose slavery. mycenae has admitted he was wrong to wrong yourself. in recompense he offers you the greatest benefaction ever known. take it, and fight. or else hector will burn the ships then kill us randomly. remember what your father said the day when ajax and myself drove up to ask if you could come with us to troy? that you should stand among the blades where honour grows. and secondly, to let your anger go. spirit, and strength, and beauty have combined such awesome power in you a vacant heaven would offer you its throne. think of what those who will come after us will say. save us from hector’s god, from hector, and from hector’s force. i go down on my knees to you, achilles.” “i must admire your courage, father friend, for treating me as if i was a fool. i shall deal with hector as i want to. you and your fellow countrymen will die for how your king has treated me. i have spent five years fighting for your king. my record is: ten coastal and ten inland cities burnt to the ground. their males, massacred. their cattle, and their women, given to him. among the rest, briseis the beautiful, my ribband she. not that i got her courtesy of him. she joined my stock in recognition of my strength, my courage, my superiority, courtesy of yourselves, my lords. i will not fight for him. he aims to personalise my loss. briseis taken from achilles—standard practice: helen from menelaos—war. lord busy busy, building his palisade, mounting my she, one that i might have picked to run my house, raising her to the status of a wife. do i hate him? yes, i hate him. hate him. and should he be afraid of me? he should. i want to harm him. i want him to feel pain. in his body, and between his ears. i must admit, some of the things that you have said are true. but look what he has done to me! to me! the king on whom his kingliness depends! i will not fight for him. hearing your steps, i thought: at last, my friends have come to visit me. they took their time about it, true— after he took my she none of you came— now, though—admittedly they are in trouble, serious trouble—they have arrived as friends, and of their own accord. but you have not come here as friends. and you have not come of your own accord. you came because your king told you to come. you came because i am his last resort. and, incidentally, your last resort. at least he offers stuff. all you have offered is advice: ‘keep your temper . . . mind your tongue . . . think what the world will say . . .’ no mention of your king’s treatment of me. no sign of love for me behind your tears. i will not fight for him. i can remember very well indeed the day you two grand lords came visiting my father’s house, how i ran out to you, and took your hands— the greatest men that i had ever seen: ajax, my fighting cousin, strong, brave, unafraid to die; nestor, the king of sandy pylos, wisdom’s sword. and then, when all had had enough to eat and drink and it was sealed that i should come to troy, then my dear father said that lordship knows not only how to fight, and when to hold its tongue, but of the difference between a child enraged and honour bound lords. i will not fight for him. there is a king to be maintained. you are his lords. my fighting powers prove my inferiority. whatever he, through you, may grant, i must receive it as a favour, not of right, go back to him with downcast looks, a suppliant tone, acknowledge my transgressions—i did not applaud his sticky fingers on my she’s meek flesh. my mother says i have a choice: live as a happy backwood king for aye or give the world an everlasting murmur of my name, and die. be up tomorrow sharp to see me sacrifice to lord poseidon and set sail. oh, yes, his gifts: ‘the greatest benefaction ever known.’ if he put heaven in my hand i would not want it. his offers magnify himself. likewise his child. i do not want to trash the girl. she is like me. bad luck to have poor friends. bad luck to have his kingship as your sire. my father will select my wife. each spring a dozen local kings drive up and lead their daughters naked round our yard. some decent local girl. my father’s worth is all the wealth we will require. you greeks will not take troy. you have disintegrated as a fighting force. troy is your cemetery. blame your king. the man who you say has done all he can. the man who has admitted he was wrong. but he has not done all he can. and he has not admitted he was wrong. or not to me. i want him here, your king. his arms straight down his sides, his shoulders back, announcing loud and clear that he was wrong to take my she. apologising for that wrong, to me, the son of péleus. before my followers, with you, pylos and salamis, crete. sparta. tyrins, argos, calydon, the islands, here, stood to attention on either side of him. that is my offer. take it, or die. nestor may stay the night. you, dear cousin ajax, tell your king what i have said. preferably, in front of everyone.” who said, as my achilles lifted his guitar: “lord, i was never so bethumped with words since first i called my father dad.” the sea. their feet along the sand to agamemnon’s gate. and in starlit air the trojans singing: “i love my wife, i love her dearly, i love the hole she pisses through, i love her lily-white tits and her nut-brown arsehole, i could eat her shit with a wooden spoon.” <line>","living,death,religion,other religions,social commentaries,history & politics,war & conflict,mythology & folklore,greek & roman mythology,heroes & patriotism"
