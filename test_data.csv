till that infernall feend with foule uprore forwasted all their land, and them expeld: whom to avenge, she had this knight from far compeld. vi behind her farre away a dwarfe did lag, that lasie seemd in being ever last, or wearied with bearing of her bag of needments at his backe. thus as they past, the day with cloudes was suddeine overcast, and angry jove an hideous storme of raine did poure into his lemans lap so fast, that every wight to shrowd it did constrain, and this faire couple eke to shroud themselves were fain. vii enforst to seeke some covert nigh at hand, a shadie grove not far away they spide, that promist ayde the tempest to withstand: whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride, did spred so broad, that heavens light did hide, not perceable with power of any starre: and all within were pathes and alleies wide, with footing worne, and leading inward farre: faire harbour that them seemes; so in they entred arre. viii and foorth they passe, with pleasure forward led, joying to heare the birdes sweete harmony, which therein shrouded from the tempest dred, seemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky. much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy, the sayling pine, the cedar proud and tall, the vine-prop elme, the poplar never dry, the builder oake, sole king of forrests all, the aspine good for staves, the cypresse funerall. ix the laurell, meed of mightie conquerours and poets sage, the firre that weepeth still, the willow worne of forlorne paramours, the eugh obedient to the benders will, the birch for shaftes, the sallow for the mill, the mirrhe sweete bleeding in the bitter wound, the warlike beech, the ash for nothing ill, the fruitfull olive, and the platane round, the carver holme, the maple seeldom inward sound. x led with delight, they thus beguile the way, untill the blustring storme is overblowne; when weening to returne, whence they did stray, they cannot find that path, which first was showne, but wander too and fro in wayes unknowne, furthest from end then, when they neerest weene, that makes them doubt, their wits be not their owne: so many pathes, so many turnings seene, that which of them to take, in diverse doubt they been. xi at last resolving forward still to fare, till that some end they finde or in or out, that path they take, that beaten seemd most bare, and like to lead the labyrinth about; which when by tract they hunted had throughout, at length it brought them to a hollow cave, amid the thickest woods. the champion stout eftsoones dismounted from his courser brave, and to the dwarfe a while his needlesse spere he gave. xii be well aware, quoth then that ladie milde, least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash provoke: the danger hid, the place unknowne and wilde, breeds dreadfull doubts: oft fire is without smoke, and perill without show: therefore your stroke sir knight with-hold, till further triall made. ah ladie (said he) shame were to revoke the forward footing for an hidden shade: vertue gives her selfe light, through darkenesse for to wade. xiii yea but (quoth she) the perill of this place i better wot then you, though now too late to wish you backe returne with foule disgrace, yet wisedome warnes, whilest foot is in the gate, to stay the steppe, ere forced to retrate. this is the wandring wood, this errours den, a monster vile, whom god and man does hate: therefore i read beware. fly fly (quoth then the fearefull dwarfe:) this is no place for living men. xiv but full of fire and greedy hardiment, the youthfull knight could not for ought be staide, but forth unto the darksome hole he went, and looked in: his glistring armor made a litle glooming light, much like a shade, by which he saw the ugly monster plaine, halfe like a serpent horribly displaide, but th'other halfe did womans shape retaine, most lothsom, filthie, foule, and full of vile disdaine. xv and as she lay upon the durtie ground, her huge long taile her den all overspred, yet was in knots and many boughtes upwound, pointed with mortall sting. of her there bred a thousand yong ones, which she dayly fed, sucking upon her poisonous dugs, eachone of sundry shapes, yet all ill favored: soone as that uncouth light upon them shone, into her mouth they crept, and suddain all were gone. xvi their dam upstart, out of her den effraide, and rushed forth, hurling her hideous taile about her cursed head, whose folds displaid were stretcht now forth at length without entraile. she lookt about, and seeing one in mayle armed to point, sought backe to turne againe; for light she hated as the deadly bale, ay wont in desert darknesse to remaine, where plaine none might her see, nor she see any plaine. xvii which when the valiant elfe perceiv'd, he lept as lyon fierce upon the flying pray, and with his trenchand blade her boldly kept from turning backe, and forced her to stay: therewith enrag'd she loudly gan to bray, and turning fierce, her speckled taile advaunst, threatning her angry sting, him to dismay: who nought aghast, his mightie hand enhaunst: the stroke down from her head unto her shoulder glaunst. xviii much daunted with that dint, her sence was dazd, yet kindling rage, her selfe she gathered round, and all attonce her beastly body raizd with doubled forces high above the ground: tho wrapping up her wrethed sterne arownd, lept fierce upon his shield, and her huge traine all suddenly about his body wound, that hand or foot to stirre he strove in vaine: god helpe the man so wrapt in errours endlesse traine. xix his lady sad to see his sore constraint, cride out, now now sir knight, shew what ye bee, add faith unto your force, and be not faint: strangle her, else she sure will strangle thee. that when he heard, in great perplexitie, his gall did grate for griefe and high disdaine, and knitting all his force got one hand free, wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine, that soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine. xx therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw a floud of poyson horrible and blacke, full of great lumpes of flesh and gobbets raw, which stunck so vildly, that it forst him slacke his grasping hold, and from her turne him backe: her vomit full of bookes and papers was, with loathly frogs and toades, which eyes did lacke, and creeping sought way in the weedy gras: her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has. xxi as when old father nilus gins to swell with timely pride above the aegyptian vale, his fattie waves do fertile slime outwell, and overflow each plaine and lowly dale: but when his later spring gins to avale, huge heapes of mudd he leaves, wherein there breed ten thousand kindes of creatures, partly male and partly female of his fruitfull seed; such ugly monstrous shapes elsewhere may no man reed. xxii the same so sore annoyed has the knight, that welnigh choked with the deadly stinke, his forces faile, ne can no longer fight. whose corage when the feend perceiv'd to shrinke, she poured forth out of her hellish sinke her fruitfull cursed spawne of serpents small, deformed monsters, fowle, and blacke as inke, which swarming all about his legs did crall, and him encombred sore, but could not hurt at all. xxiii as gentle shepheard in sweete even-tide, when ruddy phoebus gins to welke in west, high on an hill, his flocke to vewen wide, markes which do byte their hasty supper best; a cloud of combrous gnattes do him molest, all striving to infixe their feeble stings, that from their noyance he no where can rest, but with his clownish hands their tender wings he brusheth oft, and oft doth mar their murmurings. xxiv thus ill bestedd, and fearefull more of shame, then of the certaine perill he stood in, halfe furious unto his foe he came, resolv'd in minde all suddenly to win, or soone to lose, before he once would lin; and strooke at her with more then manly force, that from her body full of filthie sin he raft her hatefull head without remorse; a streame of cole black bloud forth gushed from her corse. xxv her scattred brood, soone as their parent deare they saw so rudely falling to the ground, groning full deadly, all with troublous feare, gathred themselves about her body round, weening their wonted entrance to have found at her wide mouth: but being there withstood they flocked all about her bleeding wound, and sucked up their dying mothers blood, making her death their life, and eke her hurt their good. xxvi that detestable sight him much amazde, to see th'unkindly impes of heaven accurst, devoure their dam; on whom while so he gazd, having all satisfide their bloudy thurst, their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst, and bowels gushing forth: well worthy end of such as drunke her life, the which them nurst; now needeth him no lenger labour spend, his foes have slaine themselves, with whom he should contend. xxvii his ladie seeing all, that chaunst, from farre approcht in hast to greet his victorie, and said, faire knight, borne under happy starre, who see your vanquisht foes before you lye: well worthy be you of that armorie, wherein ye have great glory wonne this day, and proov'd your strength on a strong enimie, your first adventure: many such i pray, and henceforth ever wish, that like succeed it may. xxviii then mounted he upon his steede againe, and with the lady backward sought to wend; that path he kept, which beaten was most plame, ne ever would to any by-way bend, but still did follow one unto the end, the which at last out of the wood them brought. so forward on his way (with god to frend) he passed forth, and new adventure sought; long way he travelled, before he heard of ought. xxix at length they chaunst to meet upon the way an aged sire, in long blacke weedes yclad, his feete all bare, his beard all hoarie gray, and by his belt his booke he hanging had; sober he seemde, and very sagely sad, and to the ground his eyes were lowly bent, simple in shew, and voyde of malice bad, and all the way he prayed, as he went, and often knockt his brest, as one that did repent. xxx he faire the knight saluted, louting low, who faire him quited, as that courteous was: and after asked him, if he did know of straunge adventures, which abroad did pas. ah my deare sonne (quoth he) how should, alas, silly old man, that lives in hidden cell, bidding his beades all day for his trespas, tydings of warre and worldly trouble tell? with holy father sits not with such things to mell. xxxi but if of daunger which hereby doth dwell, and homebred evill ye desire to heare, of a straunge man i can you tidings tell, that wasteth all this countrey farre and neare. of such (said he) i chiefly do inquere, and shall you well reward to shew the place, in which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare: for to all knighthood it is foule disgrace, that such a cursed creature lives so long a space. xxxii far hence (quoth he) in wastfull wildernesse his dwelling is, by which no living wight may ever passe, but thorough great distresse. now (sayd the lady) draweth toward night, and well i wote, that of your later fight ye all forwearied be: for what so strong, but wanting rest will also want of might? the sunne that measures heaven all day long, at night doth baite his steedes the ocean waves emong. xxxiii then with the sunne take sir, your timely rest, and with new day new worke at once begin: untroubled night they say gives counsell best. right well sir knight ye have advised bin, (quoth then that aged man;) the way to win is wisely to advise: now day is spent; therefore with me ye may take up your in for this same night. the knight was well content: so with that godly father to his home they went. xxxiv a little lowly hermitage it was, downe in a dale, hard by a forests side, far from resort of people, that did pas in travell to and froe: a little wyde there was an holy chappell edifyde, wherein the hermite dewly wont to say his holy things each morne and eventyde: thereby a christall streame did gently play, which from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway. xxxv arrived there, the little house they fill, ne looke for entertainement, where none was: rest is their feast, and all things at their will; the noblest mind the best contentment has. with faire discourse the evening so they pas: for that old man of pleasing wordes had store, and well could file his tongue as smooth as glas; he told of saintes and popes, and evermore he strowd an ave-mary after and before. xxxvi the drouping night thus creepeth on them fast, and the sad humour loading their eye liddes, as messenger of morpheus on them cast sweet slombring deaw, the which to sleepe them biddes. unto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes: where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes, he to his study goes, and there amiddes his magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes, he seekes out mighty charmes, to trouble sleepy mindes. xxxvii then choosing out few wordes most horrible, (let none them read) thereof did verses frame, with which and other spelles like terrible, he bad awake blacke plutoes griesly dame, and cursed heaven, and spake reprochfull shame of highest god, the lord of life and light; a bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name great gorgon, prince of darknesse and dead night, at which cocytus quakes, and styx is put to flight. xxxviii and forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred legions of sprights, the which like little flyes fluttring about his ever damned hed, a-waite whereto their service he applyes, to aide his friends, or fray his enimies: of those he chose out two, the falsest twoo, and fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes; the one of them he gave a message too, the other by him selfe staide other worke to doo. xxxix he making speedy way through spersed ayre, and through the world of waters wide and peepe, to morpheus house doth hastily repaire. amid the bowels of the earth full steepe, and low, where dawning day doth never peepe, his dwelling is; there tethys his wet bed doth ever wash, and cynthia still doth steepe in silver deaw his ever-drouping hed, whiles sad night over him her mantle black doth spred. xl whose double gates he findeth locked fast, the one faire fram'd of burnisht yvory, the other all with silver overcast; and wakefull dogges before them farre do lye watching to banish care their enimy, who oft is wont to trouble gentle sleepe. by them the sprite doth passe in quietly, and unto morpheus comes, whom drowned deepe in drowsie fit he findes: of nothing he takes keepe. xli and more, to lulle him in his slumber soft, a trickling streame from high rocke tumbling downe and ever-drizling raine upon the loft, mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne of swarming bees, did cast him in a swowne: no other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes, as still are wont t'annoy the walled towne, might there be heard: but carelesse quiet lyes, wrapt in eternall silence farre from enemyes. xlii the messenger approching to him spake, but his wast wordes returnd to him in vaine: so sound he slept, that nought mought him awake. then rudely he him thrust, and pusht with paine, whereat he gan to stretch: but he againe shooke him so hard, that forced him to speake. as one then in a dreame, whose dryer braine in tost with troubled sights and fancies weake, he mumbled soft, but would not all his silence breake. xliii the sprite then gan more boldly him to wake, and threatned unto him the dreaded name of hecate: whereat he gan to quake, and lifting up his lumpish head, with blame halfe angry asked him, for what he came. hither (quoth he) me archimago sent, he that the stubborne sprites can wisely tame, he bids thee to him send for his intent a fit false dreame, that can delude the sleepers sent. xliv the god obayde, and calling forth straight way a diverse dreame out of his prison darke, delivered it to him, and downe did lay his heavie head, devoide of carefull carke, whose sences all were straight benumbed and starke. he backe returning by the yvorie dore, remounted up as light as chearefull larke, and on his litle winges the dreame he bore in hast unto his lord, where he him left afore. xlv who all this while with charmes and hidden artes, had made a lady of that other spright, and fram'd of liquid ayre her tender partes so lively, and so like in all mens sight, that weaker sence it could have ravisht quight: the maker selfe for all his wondrous witt, was nigh beguiled with so goodly sight: her all in white he clad, and over it cast a blacke stole, most like to seeme for una fit. xlvi now when that ydle dreame was to him brought, unto that elfin knight he bad him fly, where he slept soundly void of evill thought and with false shewes abuse his fantasy, in sort as he him schooled privily: and that new creature borne without her dew, full of the makers guile, with usage sly he taught to imitate that lady trew, whose semblance she did carrie under feigned hew. xlvii thus well instructed, to their worke they hast, and comming where the knight in slomber lay, the one upon his hardy head him plast, and made him dreame of loves and lustfull play, that nigh his manly hart did melt away, bathed in wanton blis and wicked joy: then seemed him his lady by him lay, and to him playnd, how that false winged boy, her chast hart had subdewd, to learne dame pleasures toy. xlviii and she her selfe of beautie soveraigne queene, faire venus seemde unto his bed to bring her, whom he waking evermore did weene, to be the chastest flowre, that ay did spring on earthly braunch, the daughter of a king, now a loose leman to vile service bound: and eke the graces seemed all to sing, hymen {i}{_o} hymen, dauncing all around, while freshest flora her with yvie girlond crownd. xlix in this great passion of unwonted lust, or wonted feare of doing ought amis, he started up, as seeming to mistrust some secret ill, or hidden foe of his: lo there before his face his lady is, under blake stole hyding her bayted hooke, and as halfe blushing offred him to kis, with gentle blandishment and lovely looke, most like that virgin true, which for her knight him took. l all cleane dismayd to see so uncouth sight, and halfe enraged at her shamelesse guise, he thought have slaine her in his fierce despight: but hasty heat tempring with sufferance wise, he stayde his hand, and gan himselfe advise to prove his sense, and tempt her faigned truth. wringing her hands in wemens pitteous wise, tho can she weepe, to stirre up gentle ruth, both for her noble bloud, and for her tender youth. li and said, ah sir, my liege lord and my love, shall i accuse the hidden cruell fate, and mightie causes wrought in heaven above, or the blind god, that doth me thus amate, for hoped love to winne me certaine hate? yet thus perforce he bids me do, or die. die is my dew: yet rew my wretched state you, whom my hard avenging destinie hath made judge of my life or death indifferently. lii your owne deare sake forst me at first to leave my fathers kingdome, there she stopt with teares; her swollen hart her speach seemd to bereave, and then againe begun, my weaker yeares captiv'd to fortune and frayle worldly feares, fly to your faith for succour and sure ayde: let me not dye in languor and long teares. why dame (quoth he) what hath ye thus dismayd? what frayes ye, that were wont to comfort me affrayd? liii love of your selfe, she said, and deare constraint lets me not sleepe, but wast the wearie night in secret anguish and unpittied plaint, whiles you in carelesse sleepe are drowned quight. her doubtfull words made that redoubted knight suspect her truth: yet since no'untruth he knew, her fawning love with foule disdainefull spight he would not shend, but said, deare dame i rew, that for my sake unknowne such griefe unto you grew. liv assure your selfe, it fell not all to ground; for all so deare as life is to my hart, i deeme your love, and hold me to you bound; ne let vaine feares procure your needlesse smart, where cause is none, but to your rest depart. not all content, yet seemd she to appease her mournefull plaintes, beguiled of her art, and fed with words, that could not chuse but please, so slyding softly forth, she turnd as to her ease. lv long after lay he musing at her mood, much griev'd to think that gentle dame so light, for whose defence he was to shed his blood. at last dull wearinesse of former fight having yrockt a sleepe his irkesome spright, that troublous dreame gan freshly tosse his braine, with bowres, and beds, and ladies deare delight: but when he saw his labour all was vaine, with that misformed spright he backe returnd againe. <line>",mythology & folklore

<line>seek him in peace, and carry to his arms, <line>o sohrab, carry an unwounded son! <line>but far hence seek him, for he is not here. <line>for now it is not as when i was young, <line>when rustum was in front of every fray; <line>but now he keeps apart, and sits at home, <line>in seistan, with zal, his father old. <line>whether that his own mighty strength at last <line>feels the abhorr'd approaches of old age, <line>or in some quarrel with the persian king. <line>there go!—thou wilt not? yet my heart forebodes <line>danger or death awaits thee on this field. <line>fain would i know thee safe and well, though lost <line>to us; fain therefore send thee hence, in peace <line>to seek thy father, not seek single fights <line>in vain;—but who can keep the lion's cub <line>from ravening, and who govern rustum's son? <line>go, i will grant thee what thy heart desires."" <line> <line> so said he, and dropp'd sohrab's hand, and left <line>his bed, and the warm rugs whereon he lay; <line>and o'er his chilly limbs his woollen coat <line>he pass'd, and tied his sandals on his feet, <line>and threw a white cloak round him, and he took <line>in his right hand a ruler's staff, no sword; <line>and on his head he set his sheep-skin cap, <line>black, glossy, curl'd, the fleece of kara-kul; <line>and raised the curtain of his tent, and call'd <line>his herald to his side, and went abroad. <line> <line> the sun by this had risen, and clear'd the fog <line>from the broad oxus and the glittering sands. <line>and from their tents the tartar horsemen filed <line>into the open plain; so haman bade— <line>haman, who next to peran-wisa ruled <line>the host, and still was in his lusty prime. <line>from their black tents, long files of horse, they stream'd; <line>as when some grey november morn the files, <line>in marching order spread, of long-neck'd cranes <line>stream over casbin and the southern slopes <line>of elburz, from the aralian estuaries, <line>or some frore caspian reed-bed, southward bound <line>for the warm persian sea-board—so they stream'd. <line>the tartars of the oxus, the king's guard, <line>first, with black sheep-skin caps and with long spears; <line>large men, large steeds; who from bokhara come <line>and khiva, and ferment the milk of mares. <line>next, the more temperate toorkmuns of the south, <line>the tukas, and the lances of salore, <line>and those from attruck and the caspian sands; <line>light men and on light steeds, who only drink <line>the acrid milk of camels, and their wells. <line>and then a swarm of wandering horse, who came <line>from far, and a more doubtful service own'd; <line>the tartars of ferghana, from the banks <line>of the jaxartes, men with scanty beards <line>and close-set skull-caps; and those wilder hordes <line>who roam o'er kipchak and the northern waste, <line>kalmucks and unkempt kuzzaks, tribes who stray <line>nearest the pole, and wandering kirghizzes, <line>who come on shaggy ponies from pamere; <line>these all filed out from camp into the plain. <line>and on the other side the persians form'd;— <line>first a light cloud of horse, tartars they seem'd, <line>the ilyats of khorassan, and behind, <line>the royal troops of persia, horse and foot, <line>marshall'd battalions bright in burnish'd steel. <line>but peran-wisa with his herald came, <line>threading the tartar squadrons to the front, <line>and with his staff kept back the foremost ranks. <line>and when ferood, who led the persians, saw <line>that peran-wisa kept the tartars back, <line>he took his spear, and to the front he came, <line>and check'd his ranks, and fix'd them where they stood. <line>and the old tartar came upon the sand <line>betwixt the silent hosts, and spake, and said:— <line> <line> ""ferood, and ye, persians and tartars, hear! <line>let there be truce between the hosts to-day. <line>but choose a champion from the persian lords <line>to fight our champion sohrab, man to man."" <line> <line> as, in the country, on a morn in june, <line>when the dew glistens on the pearled ears, <line>a shiver runs through the deep corn for joy— <line>so, when they heard what peran-wisa said, <line>a thrill through all the tartar squadrons ran <line>of pride and hope for sohrab, whom they loved. <line> <line> but as a troop of pedlars, from cabool, <line>cross underneath the indian caucasus, <line>that vast sky-neighbouring mountain of milk snow; <line>crossing so high, that, as they mount, they pass <line>long flocks of travelling birds dead on the snow, <line>choked by the air, and scarce can they themselves <line>slake their parch'd throats with sugar'd mulberries— <line>in single file they move, and stop their breath, <line>for fear they should dislodge the o'erhanging snows— <line>so the pale persians held their breath with fear. <line> <line> and to ferood his brother chiefs came up <line>to counsel; gudurz and zoarrah came, <line>and feraburz, who ruled the persian host <line>second, and was the uncle of the king; <line>these came and counsell'd, and then gudurz said:— <line> <line> ""ferood, shame bids us take their challenge up, <line>yet champion have we none to match this youth. <line>he has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart. <line>but rustum came last night; aloof he sits <line>and sullen, and has pitch'd his tents apart. <line>him will i seek, and carry to his ear <line>the tartar challenge, and this young man's name. <line>haply he will forget his wrath, and fight. <line>stand forth the while, and take their challenge up."" <line> <line> so spake he; and ferood stood forth and cried:— <line>""old man, be it agreed as thou hast said! <line>let sohrab arm, and we will find a man."" <line> <line> he spake: and peran-wisa turn'd, and strode <line>back through the opening squadrons to his tent. <line>but through the anxious persians gudurz ran, <line>and cross'd the camp which lay behind, and reach'd, <line>out on the sands beyond it, rustum's tents. <line>of scarlet cloth they were, and glittering gay, <line>just pitch'd; the high pavilion in the midst <line>was rustum's, and his men lay camp'd around. <line>and gudurz enter'd rustum's tent, and found <line>rustum; his morning meal was done, but still <line>the table stood before him, charged with food— <line>a side of roasted sheep, and cakes of bread, <line>and dark green melons; and there rustum sate <line>listless, and held a falcon on his wrist, <line>and play'd with it; but gudurz came and stood <line>before him; and he look'd, and saw him stand, <line>and with a cry sprang up and dropp'd the bird, <line>and greeted gudurz with both hands, and said:— <line> <line> ""welcome! these eyes could see no better sight. <line>what news? but sit down first, and eat and drink."" <line> <line> but gudurz stood in the tent-door, and said:— <line>""not now! a time will come to eat and drink, <line>but not to-day; to-day has other needs. <line>the armies are drawn out, and stand at gaze; <line>for from the tartars is a challenge brought <line>to pick a champion from the persian lords <line>to fight their champion—and thou know'st his name— <line>sohrab men call him, but his birth is hid. <line>o rustum, like thy might is this young man's! <line>he has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart; <line>and he is young, and iran's chiefs are old, <line>or else too weak; and all eyes turn to thee. <line>come down and help us, rustum, or we lose!'' <line> <line> he spoke; but rustum answer'd with a smile:— <line>""go to! if iran's chiefs are old, then i <line>am older; if the young are weak, the king <line>errs strangely; for the king, for kai khosroo, <line>himself is young, and honours younger men, <line>and lets the aged moulder to their graves. <line>rustum he loves no more, but loves the young— <line>the young may rise at sohrab's vaunts, not i. <line>for what care i, though all speak sohrab's fame? <line>for would that i myself had such a son, <line>and not that one slight helpless girl i have— <line>a son so famed, so brave, to send to war, <line>and i to tarry with the snow-hair'd zal, <line>my father, whom the robber afghans vex, <line>and clip his borders short, and drive his herds, <line>and he has none to guard his weak old age. <line>there would i go, and hang my armour up, <line>and with my great name fence that weak old man, <line>and spend the goodly treasures i have got, <line>and rest my age, and hear of sohrab's fame, <line>and leave to death the hosts of thankless kings, <line>and with these slaughterous hands draw sword no more.'' <line> <line> he spoke, and smiled; and gudurz made reply:— <line>""what then, o rustum, will men say to this, <line>when sohrab dares our bravest forth, and seeks <line>thee most of all, and thou, whom most he seeks, <line>hidest thy face? take heed lest men should say: <line>like some old miser, rustum hoards his fame, and shuns to peril it with younger men."" and, greatly moved, then rustum made reply:— <line>""o gudurz, wherefore dost thou say such words? <line>thou knowest better words than this to say. <line>what is one more, one less, obscure or famed, <line>valiant or craven, young or old, to me? <line>are not they mortal, am not i myself? <line>but who for men of nought would do great deeds? <line>come, thou shalt see how rustum hoards his fame! <line>but i will fight unknown, and in plain arms; <line>let not men say of rustum, he was match'd <line>in single fight with any mortal man."" <line> <line> he spoke, and frown'd; and gudurz turn'd, and ran <line>back quickly through the camp in fear and joy— <line>fear at his wrath, but joy that rustum came. <line>but rustum strode to his tent-door, and call'd <line>his followers in, and bade them bring his arms, <line>and clad himself in steel; the arms he chose <line>were plain, and on his shield was no device, <line>only his helm was rich, inlaid with gold, <line>and, from the fluted spine atop, a plume <line>of horsehair waved, a scarlet horsehair plume. <line>so arm'd, he issued forth; and ruksh, his horse, <line>follow'd him like a faithful hound at heel— <line>ruksh, whose renown was noised through all the earth, <line>the horse, whom rustum on a foray once <line>did in bokhara by the river find <line>a colt beneath its dam, and drove him home, <line>and rear'd him; a bright bay, with lofty crest, <line>dight with a saddle-cloth of broider'd green <line>crusted with gold, and on the ground were work'd <line>all beasts of chase, all beasts which hunters know. <line>so follow'd, rustum left his tents, and cross'd <line>the camp, and to the persian host appear'd. <line>and all the persians knew him, and with shouts <line>hail'd; but the tartars knew not who he was. <line>and dear as the wet diver to the eyes <line>of his pale wife who waits and weeps on shore, <line>by sandy bahrein, in the persian gulf, <line>plunging all day in the blue waves, at night, <line>having made up his tale of precious pearls, <line>rejoins her in their hut upon the sands— <line>so dear to the pale persians rustum came. <line> <line> and rustum to the persian front advanced, <line>and sohrab arm'd in haman's tent, and came. <line>and as afield the reapers cut a swath <line>down through the middle of a rich man's corn, <line>and on each side are squares of standing corn, <line>and in the midst a stubble, short and bare— <line>so on each side were squares of men, with spears <line>bristling, and in the midst, the open sand. <line>and rustum came upon the sand, and cast <line>his eyes toward the tartar tents, and saw <line>sohrab come forth, and eyed him as he came. <line> <line> as some rich woman, on a winter's morn, <line>eyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge <line>who with numb blacken'd fingers makes her fire— <line>at cock-crow, on a starlit winter's morn, <line>when the frost flowers the whiten'd window-panes— <line>and wonders how she lives, and what the thoughts <line>of that poor drudge may be; so rustum eyed <line>the unknown adventurous youth, who from afar <line>came seeking rustum, and defying forth <line>all the most valiant chiefs; long he perused <line>his spirited air, and wonder'd who he was. <line>for very young he seem'd, tenderly rear'd; <line>like some young cypress, tall, and dark, and straight, <line>which in a queen's secluded garden throws <line>its slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf, <line>by midnight, to a bubbling fountain's sound— <line>so slender sohrab seem'd, so softly rear'd. <line>and a deep pity enter'd rustum's soul <line>as he beheld him coming; and he stood, <line>and beckon'd to him with his hand, and said:— <line> <line> ""o thou young man, the air of heaven is soft, <line>and warm, and pleasant; but the grave is cold! <line>heaven's air is better than the cold dead grave. <line>behold me! i am vast, and clad in iron, <line>and tried; and i have stood on many a field <line>of blood, and i have fought with many a foe— <line>never was that field lost, or that foe saved. <line>o sohrab, wherefore wilt thou rush on death? <line>be govern'd! quit the tartar host, and come <line>to iran, and be as my son to me, <line>and fight beneath my banner till i die! <line>there are no youths in iran brave as thou."" <line> <line> so he spake, mildly; sohrab heard his voice, <line>the mighty voice of rustum, and he saw <line>his giant figure planted on the sand, <line>sole, like some single tower, which a chief <line>hath builded on the waste in former years <line>against the robbers; and he saw that head, <line>streak'd with its first grey hairs;—hope filled his soul, <line>and he ran forward and embraced his knees, <line>and clasp'd his hand within his own, and said:— <line> <line> ""o, by thy father's head! by thine own soul! <line>art thou not rustum? speak! art thou not he?"" <line> <line> but rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth, <line>and turn'd away, and spake to his own soul:— <line> <line> ""ah me, i muse what this young fox may mean! <line>false, wily, boastful, are these tartar boys. <line>for if i now confess this thing he asks, <line>and hide it not, but say: rustum is here! he will not yield indeed, nor quit our foes, <line>but he will find some pretext not to fight, <line>and praise my fame, and proffer courteous gifts, <line>a belt or sword perhaps, and go his way. <line>and on a feast-tide, in afrasiab's hall, <line>in samarcand, he will arise and cry: <line>'i challenged once, when the two armies camp'd <line>beside the oxus, all the persian lords <line>to cope with me in single fight; but they <line>shrank, only rustum dared; then he and i <line>changed gifts, and went on equal terms away.' <line>so will he speak, perhaps, while men applaud; <line>then were the chiefs of iran shamed through me."" <line> <line> and then he turn'd, and sternly spake aloud:— <line>""rise! wherefore dost thou vainly question thus <line>of rustum? i am here, whom thou hast call'd <line>by challenge forth; make good thy vaunt, or yield! <line>is it with rustum only thou wouldst fight? <line>rash boy, men look on rustum's face and flee! <line>for well i know, that did great rustum stand <line>before thy face this day, and were reveal'd, <line>there would be then no talk of fighting more. <line>but being what i am, i tell thee this— <line>do thou record it in thine inmost soul: <line>either thou shalt renounce thy vaunt and yield, <line>or else thy bones shall strew this sand, till winds <line>bleach them, or oxus with his summer-floods, <line>oxus in summer wash them all away."" <line> <line> he spoke; and sohrab answer'd, on his feet:— <line>""art thou so fierce? thou wilt not fright me so! <line>i am no girl, to be made pale by words. <line>yet this thou hast said well, did rustum stand <line>here on this field, there were no fighting then. <line>but rustum is far hence, and we stand here. <line>begin! thou art more vast, more dread than i, <line>and thou art proved, i know, and i am young— <line>but yet success sways with the breath of heaven. <line>and though thou thinkest that thou knowest sure <line>thy victory, yet thou canst not surely know. <line>for we are all, like swimmers in the sea, <line>poised on the top of a huge wave of fate, <line>which hangs uncertain to which side to fall. <line>and whether it will heave us up to land, <line>or whether it will roll us out to sea, <line>back out to sea, to the deep waves of death, <line>we know not, and no search will make us know; <line>only the event will teach us in its hour."" <line> <line> he spoke, and rustum answer'd not, but hurl'd <line>his spear; down from the shoulder, down it came, <line>as on some partridge in the corn a hawk, <line>that long has tower'd in the airy clouds, <line>drops like a plummet; sohrab saw it come, <line>and sprang aside, quick as a flash; the spear <line>hiss'd, and went quivering down into the sand, <line>which it sent flying wide;—then sohrab threw <line>in turn, and full struck rustum's shield; sharp rang, <line>the iron plates rang sharp, but turn'd the spear. <line>and rustum seized his club, which none but he <line>could wield; an unlopp'd trunk it was, and huge, <line>still rough—like those which men in treeless plains <line>to build them boats fish from the flooded rivers, <line>hyphasis or hydaspes, when, high up <line>by their dark springs, the wind in winter-time <line>hath made in himalayan forests wrack, <line>and strewn the channels with torn boughs—so huge <line>the club which rustum lifted now, and struck <line>one stroke; but again sohrab sprang aside, <line>lithe as the glancing snake, and the club came <line>thundering to earth, and leapt from rustum's hand. <line>and rustum follow'd his own blow, and fell <line>to his knees, and with his fingers clutch'd the sand; <line>and now might sohrab have unsheathed his sword, <line>and pierced the mighty rustum while he lay <line>dizzy, and on his knees, and choked with sand; <line>but he look'd on, and smiled, nor bared his sword, <line>but courteously drew back, and spoke, and said:— <line> <line> ""thou strik'st too hard! that club of thine will float <line>upon the summer-floods, and not my bones. <line>but rise, and be not wroth! not wroth am i; <line>no, when i see thee, wrath forsakes my soul. <line>thou say'st, thou art not rustum; be it so! <line>who art thou then, that canst so touch my soul? <line>boy as i am, i have seen battles too— <line>have waded foremost in their bloody waves, <line>and heard their hollow roar of dying men; <line>but never was my heart thus touch'd before. <line>are they from heaven, these softenings of the heart? <line>o thou old warrior, let us yield to heaven! <line>come, plant we here in earth our angry spears, <line>and make a truce, and sit upon this sand, <line>and pledge each other in red wine, like friends, <line>and thou shalt talk to me of rustum's deeds. <line>there are enough foes in the persian host, <line>whom i may meet, and strike, and feel no pang; <line>champions enough afrasiab has, whom thou <line>mayst fight; fight them, when they confront thy spear! <line>but oh, let there be peace 'twixt thee and me!"" <line> <line> he ceased, but while he spake, rustum had risen, <line>and stood erect, trembling with rage; his club <line>he left to lie, but had regain'd his spear, <line>whose fiery point now in his mail'd right-hand <line>blazed bright and baleful, like that autumn-star, <line>the baleful sign of fevers; dust had soil'd <line>his stately crest, and dimm'd his glittering arms. <line>his breast heaved, his lips foam'd, and twice his voice <line>was choked with rage; at last these words broke way:— <line> <line> ""girl! nimble with thy feet, not with thy hands! <line>curl'd minion, dancer, coiner of sweet words! <line>fight, let me hear thy hateful voice no more! <line>thou art not in afrasiab's gardens now <line>with tartar girls, with whom thou art wont to dance; <line>but on the oxus-sands, and in the dance <line>of battle, and with me, who make no play <line>of war; i fight it out, and hand to hand. <line>speak not to me of truce, and pledge, and wine! <line>remember all thy valour; try thy feints <line>and cunning! all the pity i had is gone; <line>because thou hast shamed me before both the hosts <line>with thy light skipping tricks, and thy girl's wiles."" <line> <line> he spoke, and sohrab kindled at his taunts, <line>and he too drew his sword; at once they rush'd <line>together, as two eagles on one prey <line>come rushing down together from the clouds, <line>one from the east, one from the west; their shields <line>dash'd with a clang together, and a din <line>rose, such as that the sinewy woodcutters <line>make often in the forest's heart at morn, <line>of hewing axes, crashing trees—such blows <line>rustum and sohrab on each other hail'd. <line>and you would say that sun and stars took part <line>in that unnatural conflict; for a cloud <line>grew suddenly in heaven, and dark'd the sun <line>over the fighters' heads; and a wind rose <line>under their feet, and moaning swept the plain, <line>and in a sandy whirlwind wrapp'd the pair. <line>in gloom they twain were wrapp'd, and they alone; <line>for both the on-looking hosts on either hand <line>stood in broad daylight, and the sky was pure, <line>and the sun sparkled on the oxus stream. <line>but in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes <line>and labouring breath; first rustum struck the shield <line>which sohrab held stiff out; the steel-spiked spear <line>rent the tough plates, but fail'd to reach the skin, <line>and rustum pluck'd it back with angry groan. <line>then sohrab with his sword smote rustum's helm, <line>nor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest <line>he shore away, and that proud horsehair plume, <line>never till now defiled, sank to the dust; <line>and rustum bow'd his head; but then the gloom <line>grew blacker, thunder rumbled in the air, <line>and lightnings rent the cloud; and ruksh, the horse, <line>who stood at hand, utter'd a dreadful cry;— <line>no horse's cry was that, most like the roar <line>of some pain'd desert-lion, who all day <line>hath trail'd the hunter's javelin in his side, <line>and comes at night to die upon the sand. <line>the two hosts heard that cry, and quaked for fear, <line>and oxus curdled as it cross'd his stream. <line>but sohrab heard, and quail'd not, but rush'd on, <line>and struck again; and again rustum bow'd <line>his head; but this time all the blade, like glass, <line>sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm, <line>and in the hand the hilt remain'd alone. <line>then rustum raised his head; his dreadful eyes <line>glared, and he shook on high his menacing spear, <line>and shouted: rustum!—sohrab heard that shout, <line>and shrank amazed; back he recoil'd one step, <line>and scann'd with blinking eyes the advancing form, <line>and then he stood bewilder'd; and he dropp'd <line>his covering shield, and the spear pierced his side. <line>he reel'd, and staggering back, sank to the ground; <line>and then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell, <line>and the bright sun broke forth, and melted all <line>the cloud; and the two armies saw the pair— <line>saw rustum standing, safe upon his feet, <line>and sohrab, wounded, on the bloody sand. <line> <line> then, with a bitter smile, rustum began:— <line>""sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill <line>a persian lord this day, and strip his corpse, <line>and bear thy trophies to afrasiab's tent. <line>or else that the great rustum would come down <line>himself to fight, and that thy wiles would move <line>his heart to take a gift, and let thee go. <line>and then that all the tartar host would praise <line>thy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame, <line>to glad thy father in his weak old age. <line>fool, thou art slain, and by an unknown man! <line>dearer to the red jackals shalt thou be <line>than to thy friends, and to thy father old."" <line> <line> and, with a fearless mien, sohrab replied:— <line>""unknown thou art; yet thy fierce vaunt is vain. <line>thou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man! <line>no! rustum slays me, and this filial heart. <line>for were i match'd with ten such men as thee, <line>and i were that which till to-day i was, <line>they should be lying here, i standing there. <line>but that belovéd name unnerved my arm— <line>that name, and something, i confess, in thee, <line>which troubles all my heart, and made my shield <line>fall; and thy spear transfix'd an unarm'd foe. <line>and now thou boastest, and insult'st my fate. <line>but hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to hear: <line>the mighty rustum shall avenge my death! <line>my father, whom i seek through all the world, <line>he shall avenge my death, and punish thee!"" <line> <line> as when some hunter in the spring hath found <line>a breeding eagle sitting on her nest, <line>upon the craggy isle of a hill-lake, <line>and pierced her with an arrow as she rose, <line>and follow'd her to find her where she fell <line>far off;—anon her mate comes winging back <line>from hunting, and a great way off descries <line>his huddling young left sole; at that, he checks <line>his pinion, and with short uneasy sweeps <line>circles above his eyry, with loud screams <line>chiding his mate back to her nest; but she <line>lies dying, with the arrow in her side, <line>in some far stony gorge out of his ken, <line>a heap of fluttering feathers—never more <line>shall the lake glass her, flying over it; <line>never the black and dripping precipices <line>echo her stormy scream as she sails by— <line>as that poor bird flies home, nor knows his loss, <line>so rustum knew not his own loss, but stood <line>over his dying son, and knew him not. <line> <line> but, with a cold, incredulous voice, he said:— <line>""what prate is this of fathers and revenge? <line>the mighty rustum never had a son."" <line> <line> and, with a failing voice, sohrab replied:— <line>""ah yes, he had! and that lost son am i. <line>surely the news will one day reach his ear, <line>reach rustum, where he sits, and tarries long, <line>somewhere, i know not where, but far from here; <line>and pierce him like a stab, and make him leap <line>to arms, and cry for vengeance upon thee. <line>fierce man, bethink thee, for an only son! <line>what will that grief, what will that vengeance be? <line>oh, could i live, till i that grief had seen! <line>yet him i pity not so much, but her, <line>my mother, who in ader-baijan dwells <line>with that old king, her father, who grows grey <line>with age, and rules over the valiant koords. <line>her most i pity, who no more will see <line>sohrab returning from the tartar camp, <line>with spoils and honour, when the war is done. <line>but a dark rumour will be bruited up, <line>from tribe to tribe, until it reach her ear; <line>and then will that defenceless woman learn <line>that sohrab will rejoice her sight no more, <line>but that in battle with a nameless foe, <line>by the far-distant oxus, he is slain."" <line> <line> he spoke; and as he ceased, he wept aloud, <line>thinking of her he left, and his own death. <line>he spoke; but rustum listen'd, plunged in thought. <line>nor did he yet believe it was his son <line>who spoke, although he call'd back names he knew; <line>for he had had sure tidings that the babe, <line>which was in ader-baijan born to him, <line>had been a puny girl, no boy at all— <line>so that sad mother sent him word, for fear <line>rustum should seek the boy, to train in arms. <line>and so he deem'd that either sohrab took, <line>by a false boast, the style of rustum's son; <line>or that men gave it him, to swell his fame. <line>so deem'd he; yet he listen'd, plunged in thought <line>and his soul set to grief, as the vast tide <line>of the bright rocking ocean sets to shore <line>at the full moon; tears gather'd in his eyes; <line>for he remember'd his own early youth, <line>and all its bounding rapture; as, at dawn, <line>the shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries <line>a far, bright city, smitten by the sun, <line>through many rolling clouds—so rustum saw <line>his youth; saw sohrab's mother, in her bloom; <line>and that old king, her father, who loved well <line>his wandering guest, and gave him his fair child <line>with joy; and all the pleasant life they led, <line>they three, in that long-distant summer-time— <line>the castle, and the dewy woods, and hunt <line>and hound, and morn on those delightful hills <line>in ader-baijan. and he saw that youth, <line>of age and looks to be his own dear son, <line>piteous and lovely, lying on the sand, <line>like some rich hyacinth which by the scythe <line>of an unskilful gardener has been cut, <line>mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed, <line>and lies, a fragrant tower of purple bloom, <line>on the mown, dying grass—so sohrab lay, <line>lovely in death, upon the common sand. <line>and rustum gazed on him with grief, and said:— <line> <line> ""o sohrab, thou indeed art such a son <line>whom rustum, wert thou his, might well have loved! <line>yet here thou errest, sohrab, or else men <line>have told thee false—thou art not rustum's son. <line>for rustum had no son; one child he had— <line>but one—a girl; who with her mother now <line>plies some light female task, nor dreams of us— <line>of us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war."" <line> <line> but sohrab answer'd him in wrath: for now <line>the anguish of the deep-fix'd spear grew fierce, <line>and he desired to draw forth the steel, <line>and let the blood flow free, and so to die— <line>but first he would convince his stubborn foe; <line>and, rising sternly on one arm, he said:— <line> <line> ""man, who art thou who dost deny my words? <line>truth sits upon the lips of dying men, <line>and falsehood, while i lived, was far from mine. <line>i tell thee, prick'd upon this arm i bear <line>that seal which rustum to my mother gave, <line>that she might prick it on the babe she bore."" <line> <line> he spoke; and all the blood left rustum's cheeks, <line>and his knees totter'd, and he smote his hand <line>against his breast, his heavy mailed hand, <line>that the hard iron corslet clank'd aloud; <line>and to his heart he press'd the other hand, <line>and in a hollow voice he spake, and said:— <line> <line> ""sohrab, that were a proof which could not lie! <line>if thou show this, then art thou rustum's son."" <line> <line> then, with weak hasty fingers, sohrab loosed <line>his belt, and near the shoulder bared his arm, <line>and show'd a sign in faint vermilion points <line>prick'd; as a cunning workman, in pekin, <line>pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase, <line>an emperor's gift—at early morn he paints, <line>and all day long, and, when night comes, the lamp <line>lights up his studious forehead and thin hands— <line>so delicately prick'd the sign appear'd <line>on sohrab's arm, the sign of rustum's seal. <line>it was that griffin, which of old rear'd zal, <line>rustum's great father, whom they left to die, <line>a helpless babe, among the mountain-rocks; <line>him that kind creature found, and rear'd, and loved— <line>then rustum took it for his glorious sign. <line>and sohrab bared that image on his arm, <line>and himself scann'd it long with mournful eyes, <line>and then he touch'd it with his hand and said:— <line> <line> ""how say'st thou? is that sign the proper sign <line>of rustum's son, or of some other man's?"" <line> <line> he spoke; but rustum gazed, and gazed, and stood <line>speechless; and then he utter'd one sharp cry: <line>o boy—thy father!—and his voice choked there. <line>and then a dark cloud pass'd before his eyes, <line>and his head swam, and he sank down to earth. <line>but sohrab crawl'd to where he lay, and cast <line>his arms about his neck, and kiss'd his lips, <line>and with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks, <line>trying to call him back to life; and life <line>came back to rustum, and he oped his eyes, <line>and they stood wide with horror; and he seized <line>in both his hands the dust which lay around, <line>and threw it on his head, and smirch'd his hair,— <line>his hair, and face, and beard, and glittering arms; <line>and strong convulsive groanings shook his breast, <line>and his sobs choked him; and he clutch'd his sword, <line>to draw it, and for ever let life out. <line>but sohrab saw his thoughts, and held his hands <line>and with a soothing voice he spake, and said:— <line> <line> ""father, forbear! for i but meet to-day <line>the doom which at my birth was written down <line>in heaven, and thou art heaven's unconscious hand. <line>surely my heart cried out that it was thou, <line>when first i saw thee; and thy heart spoke too, <line>i know it! but fate trod those promptings down <line>under its iron heel; fate, fate engaged <line>the strife, and hurl'd me on my father's spear. <line>but let us speak no more of this! i find <line>my father; let me feel that i have found! <line>come, sit beside me on this sand, and take <line>my head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks, <line>and wash them with thy tears, and say: my son! quick! quick! for number'd are my sands of life, <line>and swift; for like the lightning to this field <line>i came, and like the wind i go away— <line>sudden, and swift, and like a passing wind. <line>but it was writ in heaven that this should be."" <line> <line> so said he, and his voice released the heart <line>of rustum, and his tears broke forth; he cast <line>his arms round his son's neck, and wept aloud, <line>and kiss'd him. and awe fell on both the hosts, <line>when they saw rustum's grief; and ruksh, the horse, <line>with his head bowing to the ground and mane <line>sweeping the dust, came near, and in mute woe <line>first to the one then to the other moved <line>his head, as if enquiring what their grief <line>might mean; and from his dark, compassionate eyes, <line>the big warm tears roll'd down, and caked the sand. <line>but rustum chid him with stern voice, and said:— <line> <line> ""ruksh, now thou grievest; but, o ruksh, thy feet <line>should first have rotted on their nimble joints, <line>or ere they brought thy master to this field!"" <line> <line> but sohrab look'd upon the horse and said;— <line>""is this, then, ruksh? how often, in past days <line>my mother told me of thee, thou brave steed, <line>my terrible father's terrible horse! and said, <line>that i should one day find thy lord and thee. <line>come, let me lay my hand upon thy mane! <line>o ruksh, thou art more fortunate than i; <line>for thou has gone where i shall never go, <line>and snuff'd the breezes of my father's home. <line>and thou hast trod the sands of seistan, <line>and seen the river of helmund, and the lake <line>of zirrah; and the aged zal himself <line>has often stroked thy neck, and given thee food, <line>corn in a golden platter soak'd with wine, <line>and said; o ruksh! bear rustrum well!—but i <line>have never known my grandsire's furrow'd face, <line>nor seen his lofty house in seistan, <line>nor slaked my thirst at the clear helmund stream; <line>but lodged among my father's foes, and seen <line>afrasiab's cities only, samarcand, <line>bokhara, and lone khiva in the waste, <line>and the black toorkmun tents; and only drunk <line>the desert rivers, moorghab and tejend, <line>kohik, and where the kalmuks feed their sheep, <line>the northern sir; and this great oxus stream, <line>the yellow oxus, by whose brink i die."" <line> <line> then, with a heavy groan, rustum bewail'd:— <line>""oh, that its waves were flowing over me! <line>oh, that i saw its grains of yellow silt <line>roll, tumbling in the current o'er my head!"" <line> <line> but, with a grave mild voice, sohrab replied:— <line>""desire not that, my father! thou must live. <line>for some are born to do great deeds, and live, <line>as some are born to be obscured, and die. <line>do thou the deeds i die too young to do, <line>and reap a second glory in thine age; <line>thou art my father, and thy gain is mine. <line>but come! thou seest this great host of men <line>which follow me; i pray thee, slay not these! <line>let me entreat for them; what have they done? <line>they follow'd me, my hope, my fame, my star. <line>let them all cross the oxus back in peace. <line>but me thou must bear hence, not send with them, <line>but carry me with thee to seistan, <line>and place me on a bed, and mourn for me, <line>thou, and the snow-hair'd zal, and all thy friends. <line>and thou must lay me in that lovely earth, <line>and heap a stately mound above my bones, <line>and plant a far-seen pillar over all. <line>that so the passing horseman on the waste <line>may see my tomb a great way off, and cry: <line>sohrab, the mighty rustum's son, lies there, whom his great father did in ignorance kill! and i be not forgotten in my grave."" <line> <line> and, with a mournful voice, rustum replied:— <line>""fear not! as thou hast said, sohrab, my son, <line>so shall it be; for i will burn my tents, <line>and quit the host, and bear thee hence with me, <line>and carry thee away to seistan, <line>and place thee on a bed, and mourn for thee, <line>with the snow-headed zal, and all my friends. <line>and i will lay thee in the lovely earth, <line>and heap a stately mound above thy bones, <line>and plant a far-seen pillar over all, <line>and men shall not forget thee in thy grave. <line>and i will spare thy host; yea, let them go! <line>let them all cross the oxus back in peace! <line>what should i do with slaying any more? <line>for would that all whom i have ever slain <line>might be once more alive; my bitterest foes, <line>and they who were call'd champions in their time, <line>and through whose death i won that fame i have— <line>and i were nothing but a common man, <line>a poor, mean soldier, and without renown, <line>so thou mightest live too, my son, my son! <line>or rather would that i, even i myself, <line>might now be lying on this bloody sand, <line>near death, and by an ignorant stroke of thine, <line>not thou of mine! and i might die, not thou; <line>and i, not thou, be borne to seistan; <line>and zal might weep above my grave, not thine; <line>and say: o son, i weep thee not too sore, for willingly, i know, thou met'st thine end! but now in blood and battles was my youth, <line>and full of blood and battles is my age, <line>and i shall never end this life of blood."" <line> <line> then, at the point of death, sohrab replied:— <line>""a life of blood indeed, thou dreadful man! <line>but thou shalt yet have peace; only not now, <line>not yet! but thou shalt have it on that day, <line>when thou shalt sail in a high-masted ship, <line>thou and the other peers of kai khosroo, <line>returning home over the salt blue sea, <line>from laying thy dear master in his grave."" <line> <line> and rustum gazed in sohrab's face, and said:— <line>""soon be that day, my son, and deep that sea! <line>till then, if fate so wills, let me endure."" <line> <line> he spoke; and sohrab smiled on him, and took <line>the spear, and drew it from his side, and eased <line>his wound's imperious anguish; but the blood <line>came welling from the open gash, and life <line>flow'd with the stream;—all down his cold white side <line>the crimson torrent ran, dim now and soil'd, <line>like the soil'd tissue of white violets <line>left, freshly gather'd, on their native bank, <line>by children whom their nurses call with haste <line>indoors from the sun's eye; his head droop'd low, <line>his limbs grew slack; motionless, white, he lay— <line>white, with eyes closed; only when heavy gasps, <line>deep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame, <line>convulsed him back to life, he open'd them, <line>and fix'd them feebly on his father's face; <line>till now all strength was ebb'd, and from his limbs <line>unwillingly the spirit fled away, <line>regretting the warm mansion which it left, <line>and youth, and bloom, and this delightful world. <line> <line> so, on the bloody sand, sohrab lay dead; <line>and the great rustum drew his horseman's cloak <line>down o'er his face, and sate by his dead son. <line>as those black granite pillars, once high-rear'd <line>by jemshid in persepolis, to bear <line>his house, now 'mid their broken flights of steps <line>lie prone, enormous, down the mountain side— <line>so in the sand lay rustum by his son. <line> <line> and night came down over the solemn waste, <line>and the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair, <line>and darken'd all; and a cold fog, with night, <line>crept from the oxus. soon a hum arose, <line>as of a great assembly loosed, and fires <line>began to twinkle through the fog; for now <line>both armies moved to camp, and took their meal; <line>the persians took it on the open sands <line>southward, the tartars by the river marge; <line>and rustum and his son were left alone. <line> <line> but the majestic river floated on, <line>out of the mist and hum of that low land, <line>into the frosty starlight, and there moved, <line>rejoicing, through the hush'd chorasmian waste, <line>under the solitary moon;—he flow'd <line>right for the polar star, past orgunjè, <line>brimming, and bright, and large; then sands begin <line>to hem his watery march, and dam his streams, <line>and split his currents; that for many a league <line>the shorn and parcell'd oxus strains along <line>through beds of sand and matted rushy isles— <line>oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had <line>in his high mountain-cradle in pamere, <line>a foil'd circuitous wanderer—till at last <line>the long'd-for dash of waves is heard, and wide <line>his luminous home of waters opens, bright <line>and tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars <line>emerge, and shine upon the aral sea. <line> <line>","relationships,friends & enemies,nature,landscapes & pastorals,seas, rivers, & streams,religion,social commentaries,war & conflict,mythology & folklore,heroes & patriotism"

<line> <line>then rivers felt his skiffs of the light alder; <line> <line>then sailors counted up the stars and named them: <line> <line>pleiades, hyades, and the pole star; <line> <line>then were discovered ways to take wild things. <line> <line>in snares, or hunt them with the circling pack; <line> <line>and how to whip a stream with casting nets, <line> <line>or draw the deep-sea fisherman’s cordage up; <line> <line>and then the use of steel and the shrieking saw; <line> <line>then various crafts. all things were overcome <line> <line>by labor and by force of bitter need. <line> <line>ii. even when your threshing floor is leveled <line> <line>by the big roller, smoothed and packed by hand <line> <line>with potter’s clay, so that it will not crack, <line> <line>there are still nuisances. the tiny mouse <line> <line>locates his house and granary underground, <line> <line>or the blind mole tunnels his dark chamber; <line> <line>the toad, too, and all monsters of the earth, <line> <line>besides those plunderers of the grain, the weevil <line> <line>and frantic ant, scared of a poor old age. <line> <line>let me speak then, too, of the farmer’s weapons: <line> <line>the heavy oaken plow and the plowshare, <line> <line>the slowly rolling carts of demeter, <line> <line>the threshing machine, the sledge, the weighted mattock, <line> <line>the withe baskets, the cheap furniture, <line> <line>the harrow and the magic winnowing fan— <line> <line>all that your foresight makes provision of, <line> <line>if you still favor the divine countryside. <line> <line>iii. moreover, like men tempted by the straits <line> <line>in ships borne homeward through the blowing sea, <line> <line>we too must reckon on arcturus star, <line> <line>the days of luminous draco and the kids. <line> <line>when libra makes the hours of sleep and daylight <line> <line>equal, dividing the world, half light, half dark, <line> <line>then drive the team, and sow the field with barley, <line> <line>even under intractable winter’s rain. <line> <line>but spring is the time to sow your beans and clover, <line> <line>when shining taurus opens the year with his golden <line> <line>horns, and the dog’s averted star declines; <line> <line>for greater harvests of your wheat and spelt, <line> <line>let first the pleiades and hyades be hid <line> <line>and ariadne’s diadem go down. <line> <line>the golden sun rules the great firmament <line> <line>through the twelve constellations, and the world <line> <line>is measured out in certain parts, and heaven <line> <line>by five great zones is taken up entire: <line> <line>one glowing with sundazzle and fierce heat; <line> <line>and far away on either side the arctics, <line> <line>frozen with ice and rain, cerulean; <line> <line>and, in between, two zones for sick mankind: <line> <line>through each of these a slanting path is cut <line> <line>where pass in line the zodiacal stars. <line> <line>northward the steep world rises to scythia <line> <line>and south of libya descends, where black <line> <line>styx and the lowest of the dead look on. <line> <line>in the north sky the snake glides like a river <line> <line>winding about the great and little bear— <line> <line>those stars that fear forever the touch of ocean; <line> <line>southward they say profound night, mother of furies, <line> <line>sits tight-lipped among the crowding shades, <line> <line>or thence aurora draws the daylight back; <line> <line>and where the east exhales the yellow morning, <line> <line>reddening evening lights her stars at last. <line> <line>iv. as for the winter, when the freezing rains <line> <line>confine the farmer, he may employ himself <line> <line>in preparations for serener seasons. <line> <line>the plowman beats the plowshare on the forge, <line> <line>or makes his vats of tree-trunks hollowed out, <line> <line>brands his cattle, numbers his piles of grain, <line> <line>sharpens fence posts or pitchforks, prepares <line> <line>umbrian trellises for the slow vine. <line> <line>then you may weave the baskets of bramble twigs <line> <line>or dip your bleating flock in the clean stream. <line> <line>often the farmer loads his little mule <line> <line>with olive oil or apples, and brings home <line> <line>a grindstone or a block of pitch from market. <line> <line>and some will stay up late beside the fire <line> <line>on winter nights, whittling torches, while <line> <line>the housewife runs the shuttle through the loom <line> <line>and comforts the long labor with her singing; <line> <line>or at the stove she simmers the new wine, <line> <line>skimming the froth with leaves. oh idle time! <line> <line>in that hale season, all their worries past, <line> <line>farmers arrange convivialities— <line> <line>as after laden ships have reached home port, <line> <line>the happy sailors load the prow with garlands. <line> <line>then is the time to gather acorns and <line> <line>laurel berries and the bloodred myrtle, <line> <line>to lay your traps for cranes and snares for buck, <line> <line>to hit the fallow deer with twisted slingshots, <line> <line>and track the long-eared hare— <line> <line>when snow is deep, and ice is on the rivers. <line> <line>v. what of the humors and the ways of autumn? <line> <line>just when the farmer wished to reap his yellow <line> <line>fields, and thresh his grain, <line> <line>i have often seen all the winds make war, <line> <line>flattening the stout crops from the very roots; <line> <line>and in the black whirlwind <line> <line>carrying off the ears and the light straw. <line> <line>and often mighty phalanxes of rain <line> <line>marched out of heaven, as the clouds <line> <line>rolled up from the sea the detestable tempest; <line> <line>then the steep aether thundered, and the deluge <line> <line>soaked the crops, filled ditches, made the rivers <line> <line>rise and roar and seethe in their spuming beds. <line> <line>the father himself in the mid stormy night <line> <line>lets the lightning go, at whose downstroke <line> <line>enormous earth quivers, wild things flee, <line> <line>and fear abases the prone hearts of men— <line> <line>as jove splits athos with his firebolt <line> <line>or rhodope or the ceraunian ridge. <line> <line>the southwind wails in sheets of rain, <line> <line>and under that great wind the groves <line> <line>lament, and the long breast of the shore is shaken. <line> <line>if you dislike to be so caught, mark well <line> <line>the moon’s phases and the weather signs; <line> <line>notice where saturn’s frigid star retires, <line> <line>mercury’s wanderings over heaven; and revere <line> <line>especially, the gods. offer to ceres <line> <line>annual sacrifice and annual worship <line> <line>in the first fair weather of the spring, <line> <line>so may your sheep grow fat and your vines fruitful, <line> <line>your sleep sweet and your mountains full of shade. <line> <line>let all the country folk come to adore her, <line> <line>and offer her libations of milk and wine; <line> <line>conduct the sacrificial lamb three times <line> <line>around the ripe field, in processional, <line> <line>with all your chorus singing out to ceres; <line> <line>and let no man lay scythe against his grain <line> <line>unless he first bind oakleaves on his head <line> <line>and make his little dance, and sing to her. <line> <line>vi. when shall we herd the cattle to the stables? <line> <line>the wind, say, rises without intermission; <line> <line>the sea gets choppy and the swell increases; <line> <line>the dry crash of boughs is heard on hills; <line> <line>the long sound of the surf becomes a tumult; <line> <line>the gusts become more frequent in the grove; <line> <line>the waves begin to fight against the keels; <line> <line>from far at sea the gulls fly shoreward crying; <line> <line>the heron leaves his favorite marsh and soars <line> <line>over the high cloud. then you will see <line> <line>beyond thin skimrack, shooting stars <line> <line>falling, the long pale tracks behind them <line> <line>whitening through the darkness of the night; <line> <line>and you’ll see straw and fallen leaves blowing. <line> <line>but when it thunders in rough boreas’ quarter, <line> <line>when east and west it thunders—every sailor <line> <line>furls his dripping sail. <line> <line>a storm should never catch you unprepared. <line> <line>aerial cranes take flight before its rising, <line> <line>the restless heifer with dilated nostrils <line> <line>sniffs the air; the squeaking hirondelle <line> <line>flits round and round the lake, and frogs, <line> <line>inveterate in their mud, croak a chorale. <line> <line>and too the ant, more frantic in his gallery, <line> <line>trundles his eggs out from their hiding place; <line> <line>the rainbow, cloud imbiber, may be seen; <line> <line>and crows go cawing from the pasture <line> <line>in a harsh throng of crepitating wings; <line> <line>the jeering jay gives out his yell for rain <line> <line>and takes a walk by himself on the dry sand. <line> <line>stormwise, the various sea-fowl, and such birds <line> <line>as grub the sweet swan river in asia, <line> <line>may be observed dousing themselves and diving <line> <line>or riding on the water, as if they wished— <line> <line>what odd exhilaration—to bathe themselves. <line> <line>vii. after a storm, clear weather and continuing <line> <line>sunny days may likewise be foretold: <line> <line>by the sharp twinkle of the stars, the moon <line> <line>rising to face her brother’s rays by day; <line> <line>no tenuous fleeces blowing in the sky, <line> <line>no halcyons, sea favorites, on the shore <line> <line>stretching out their wings in tepid sunlight; <line> <line>but mists go lower and lie on the fields, <line> <line>the owl, observing sundown from his perch, <line> <line>modulates his meaningless melancholy. <line> <line>aloft in crystal air the sparrow hawk <line> <line>chases his prey; and as she flits aside <line> <line>the fierce hawk follows screaming on the wind, <line> <line>and as he swoops, she flits aside again. <line> <line>with funereal contractions of the windpipe <line> <line>the crows produce their caws, three at a time, <line> <line>and in their high nests, pleased at i know not what, <line> <line>noise it among themselves: no doubt rejoicing <line> <line>to see their little brood after the storm, <line> <line>but not, i think, by reason of divine <line> <line>insight or superior grasp of things. <line> <line>viii. but if you carefully watch the rapid sun <line> <line>and the moon following, a fair night’s snare <line> <line>never deceives you as to next day’s weather. <line> <line>when the new moon collects a rim of light, <line> <line>if that bow be obscured with a dark vapor, <line> <line>then a great tempest is in preparation; <line> <line>if it be blushing like a virgin’s cheek, <line> <line>there will be wind; wind makes diana blush; <line> <line>if on the fourth night (most significant) <line> <line>she goes pure and unclouded through the sky, <line> <line>all that day and the following days will be, <line> <line>for one full month, exempt from rain and wind. <line> <line>the sun, too, rising and setting in the waves, <line> <line>will give you weather signs, trustworthy ones <line> <line>whether at morning or when stars come out. <line> <line>a mackerel sky over the east at sunrise <line> <line>means look out for squalls, a gale is coming, <line> <line>unfavorable to trees and plants and flocks. <line> <line>or when through denser strata the sun’s rays <line> <line>break out dimly, or aurora rises <line> <line>pale from tithonus’ crocus-colored chamber, <line> <line>alas, the vine-leaf will not shield the cluster <line> <line>in the hubbub of roof-pattering bitter hail. <line> <line>it will be well to notice sunset, too, <line> <line>for the sun’s visage then has various colors; <line> <line>bluish and dark means rain; if it be fiery <line> <line>that means an east wind; if it be dappled <line> <line>and mixed with red gold light, then you will see <line> <line>wind and rain in commotion everywhere. <line> <line>nobody can advise me, on that night, <line> <line>to cast off hawsers and put out to sea. <line> <line>but if the next day passes and the sunset <line> <line>then be clear, you need not fear the weather: <line> <line>a bright norther will sway the forest trees. <line> <line>ix. last, what the late dusk brings, and whence the fair <line> <line>clouds are blown, and secrets of the southwind <line> <line>you may learn from the sun, whose prophecies <line> <line>no man denies, seeing black insurrections, <line> <line>treacheries, and wars are told by him. <line> <line>when caesar died, the great sun pitied rome, <line> <line>so veiling his bright head, the godless time <line> <line>trembled in fear of everlasting night; <line> <line>and then were portents given of earth and ocean, <line> <line>vile dogs upon the roads, and hideous <line> <line>strange birds, and aetna quaking, and her fires <line> <line>bursting to overflow the cyclops’ fields <line> <line>with flames whirled in the air and melted stones. <line> <line>thunder of war was heard in germany <line> <line>from south to north, shaking the granite alps; <line> <line>and a voice also through the silent groves <line> <line>piercing; and apparitions wondrous pale <line> <line>were seen in dead of night. then cattle spoke <line> <line>(o horror!), streams stood still, the earth cracked open <line> <line>and tears sprang even from the temple bronze. <line> <line>the po, monarch of rivers, on his back <line> <line>spuming whole forests, raced through the lowland plains <line> <line>and bore off pens and herds; and then continually <line> <line>the viscera of beasts were thick with evil, <line> <line>blood trickled from the springs; tall towns at night <line> <line>re-echoed to the wolf-pack’s shivering howl; <line> <line>and never from pure heaven have there fallen <line> <line>so many fires, nor baleful comets burned. <line> <line>it seemed that once again the roman lines, <line> <line>alike in arms, would fight at philippi;

ardent as he is— <line>call his great truth a lie, why, still the old <line>""be it as god please"" reassureth him. <line>i probed the sore as thy disciple should: <line>""how, beast,"" said i, ""this stolid carelessness <line>sufficeth thee, when rome is on her march <line>to stamp out like a little spark thy town, <line>thy tribe, thy crazy tale and thee at once?"" <line>he merely looked with his large eyes on me. <line>the man is apathetic, you deduce? <line>contrariwise, he loves both old and young, <line>able and weak, affects the very brutes <line>and birds—how say i? flowers of the field— <line>as a wise workman recognizes tools <line>in a master's workshop, loving what they make. <line>thus is the man as harmless as a lamb: <line>only impatient, let him do his best, <line>at ignorance and carelessness and sin— <line>an indignation which is promptly curbed: <line>as when in certain travels i have feigned <line>to be an ignoramus in our art <line>according to some preconceived design, <line>and happed to hear the land's practitioners, <line>steeped in conceit sublimed by ignorance, <line>prattle fantastically on disease, <line>its cause and cure—and i must hold my peace! <line>thou wilt object—why have i not ere this <line>sought out the sage himself, the nazarene <line>who wrought this cure, inquiring at the source, <line>conferring with the frankness that befits? <line>alas! it grieveth me, the learned leech <line>perished in a tumult many years ago, <line>accused,—our learning's fate,—of wizardry, <line>rebellion, to the setting up a rule <line>and creed prodigious as described to me. <line>his death, which happened when the earthquake fell <line>(prefiguring, as soon appeared, the loss <line>to occult learning in our lord the sage <line>who lived there in the pyramid alone) <line>was wrought by the mad people—that's their wont! <line>on vain recourse, as i conjecture it, <line>to his tried virtue, for miraculous help— <line>how could he stop the earthquake?

and with inspection deep <line> <line>consider'd every creature, which of all <line> <line>most opportune might serve his wiles, and found <line> <line>the serpent suttlest beast of all the field. <line> <line>him after long debate, irresolute <line> <line>of thoughts revolv'd, his final sentence chose <line> <line>fit vessel, fittest imp of fraud, in whom <line> <line>to enter, and his dark suggestions hide <line> <line>from sharpest sight: for in the wilie snake, <line> <line>whatever sleights none would suspicious mark, <line> <line>as from his wit and native suttletie <line> <line>proceeding, which in other beasts observ'd <line> <line>doubt might beget of diabolic pow'r <line> <line>active within beyond the sense of brute. <line> <line>thus he resolv'd, but first from inward griefe <line> <line>his bursting passion into plaints thus pour'd: <line> <line>o earth, how like to heav'n, if not preferr'd <line> <line>more justly, seat worthier of gods, as built <line> <line>with second thoughts, reforming what was old! <line> <line>for what god after better worse would build? <line> <line>terrestrial heav'n, danc't round by other heav'ns <line> <line>that shine, yet bear thir bright officious lamps, <line> <line>light above light, for thee alone, as seems, <line> <line>in thee concentring all thir precious beams <line> <line>of sacred influence: as god in heav'n <line> <line>is center, yet extends to all, so thou <line> <line>centring receav'st from all those orbs; in thee, <line> <line>not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers <line> <line>productive in herb, plant, and nobler birth <line> <line>of creatures animate with gradual life <line> <line>of growth, sense, reason, all summ'd up in man. <line> <line>with what delight could i have walkt thee round, <line> <line>if i could joy in aught, sweet interchange <line> <line>of hill, and vallie, rivers, woods and plaines, <line> <line>now land, now sea, and shores with forrest crownd, <line> <line>rocks, dens, and caves; but i in none of these <line> <line>find place or refuge; and the more i see <line> <line>pleasures about me, so much more i feel <line> <line>torment within me, as from the hateful siege <line> <line>of contraries; all good to me becomes <line> <line>bane, and in heav'n much worse would be my state. <line> <line>but neither here seek i, no nor in heav'n <line> <line>to dwell, unless by maistring heav'ns supreame; <line> <line>nor hope to be my self less miserable <line> <line>by what i seek, but others to make such <line> <line>as i, though thereby worse to me redound: <line> <line>for onely in destroying i find ease <line> <line>to my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd, <line> <line>or won to what may work his utter loss, <line> <line>for whom all this was made, all this will soon <line> <line>follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe, <line> <line>in wo then; that destruction wide may range: <line> <line>to mee shall be the glorie sole among <line> <line>the infernal powers, in one day to have marr'd <line> <line>what he almightie styl'd, six nights and days <line> <line>continu'd making, and who knows how long <line> <line>before had bin contriving, though perhaps <line> <line>not longer then since i in one night freed <line> <line>from servitude inglorious welnigh half <line> <line>th' angelic name, and thinner left the throng <line> <line>of his adorers: hee to be aveng'd, <line> <line>and to repaire his numbers thus impair'd, <line> <line>whether such vertue spent of old now faild <line> <line>more angels to create, if they at least <line> <line>are his created, or to spite us more, <line> <line>determin'd to advance into our room <line> <line>a creature form'd of earth, and him endow, <line> <line>exalted from so base original, <line> <line>with heav'nly spoils, our spoils: what he decreed <line> <line>he effected; man he made, and for him built <line> <line>magnificent this world, and earth his seat, <line> <line>him lord pronounc'd, and, o indignitie! <line> <line>subjected to his service angel wings, <line> <line>and flaming ministers to watch and tend <line> <line>thir earthy charge: of these the vigilance <line> <line>i dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist <line> <line>of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie <line> <line>in every bush and brake, where hap may finde <line> <line>the serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds <line> <line>to hide me, and the dark intent i bring. <line> <line>o foul descent! that i who erst contended <line> <line>with gods to sit the highest, am now constraind <line> <line>into a beast, and mixt with bestial slime, <line> <line>this essence to incarnate and imbrute, <line> <line>that to the hight of deitie aspir'd; <line> <line>but what will not ambition and revenge <line> <line>descend to? who aspires must down as low <line> <line>as high he soard, obnoxious first or last <line> <line>to basest things. revenge, at first though sweet, <line> <line>bitter ere long back on it self recoiles; <line> <line>let it; i reck not, so it light well aim'd, <line> <line>since higher i fall short, on him who next <line> <line>provokes my envie, this new favorite <line> <line>of heav'n, this man of clay, son of despite, <line> <line>whom us the more to spite his maker rais'd <line> <line>from dust: spite then with spite is best repaid. <line> <line>so saying, through each thicket danck or drie, <line> <line>like a black mist low creeping, he held on <line> <line>his midnight search, where soonest he might finde <line> <line>the serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found <line> <line>in labyrinth of many a round self-rowld, <line> <line>his head the midst, well stor'd with suttle wiles: <line> <line>not yet in horrid shade or dismal den, <line> <line>nor nocent yet, but on the grassie herbe <line> <line>fearless unfeard he slept: in at his mouth <line> <line>the devil enterd, and his brutal sense, <line> <line>in heart or head, possessing soon inspir'd <line> <line>with act intelligential, but his sleep <line> <line>disturbd not, waiting close th' approach of morn. <line> <line>now when as sacred light began to dawne <line> <line>in eden on the humid flours, that breathd <line> <line>thir morning incense, when all things that breath, <line> <line>from th' earths great altar send up silent praise <line> <line>to the creator, and his nostrils fill <line> <line>with grateful smell, forth came the human pair <line> <line>and joind thir vocal worship to the quire <line> <line>of creatures wanting voice, that done, partake <line> <line>the season, prime for sweetest sents and aires: <line> <line>then commune how that day they best may ply <line> <line>thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew <line> <line>the hands dispatch of two gardning so wide. <line> <line>and eve first to her husband thus began.adam, well may we labour still to dress <line> <line>this garden, still to tend plant, herb and flour, <line> <line>our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands <line> <line>aid us, the work under our labour grows, <line> <line>luxurious by restraint; what we by day <line> <line>lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, <line> <line>one night or two with wanton growth derides <line> <line>tending to wilde. thou therefore now advise <line> <line>or hear what to my minde first thoughts present, <line> <line>let us divide our labours, thou where choice <line> <line>leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind <line> <line>the woodbine round this arbour, or direct <line> <line>the clasping ivie where to climb, while i <line> <line>in yonder spring of roses intermixt <line> <line>with myrtle, find what to redress till noon: <line> <line>for while so near each other thus all day <line> <line>our taske we choose, what wonder if so near <line> <line>looks intervene and smiles, or object new <line> <line>casual discourse draw on, which intermits <line> <line>our dayes work brought to little, though begun <line> <line>early, and th' hour of supper comes unearn'd. <line> <line>to whom mild answer adam thus return'd. <line> <line>sole eve, associate sole, to me beyond <line> <line>compare above all living creatures deare, <line> <line>well hast thou motion'd, well thy thoughts imployd <line> <line>how we might best fulfill the work which here <line> <line>god hath assign'd us, nor of me shalt pass <line> <line>unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found <line> <line>in woman, then to studie houshold good, <line> <line>and good workes in her husband to promote. <line> <line>yet not so strictly hath our lord impos'd <line> <line>labour, as to debarr us when we need <line> <line>refreshment, whether food, or talk between, <line> <line>food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse <line> <line>of looks and smiles, for smiles from reason flow, <line> <line>to brute deni'd, and are of love the food, <line> <line>love not the lowest end of human life. <line> <line>for not to irksom toile, but to delight <line> <line>he made us, and delight to reason joyn'd. <line> <line>these paths & bowers doubt not but our joynt hands <line> <line>will keep from wilderness with ease, as wide <line> <line>as we need walk, till younger hands ere long <line> <line>assist us: but if much converse perhaps <line> <line>thee satiate, to short absence i could yield. <line> <line>for solitude somtimes is best societie, <line> <line>and short retirement urges sweet returne. <line> <line>but other doubt possesses me, least harm <line> <line>befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst <line> <line>what hath bin warn'd us, what malicious foe <line> <line>envying our happiness, and of his own <line> <line>despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame <line> <line>by sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand <line> <line>watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find <line> <line>his wish and best advantage, us asunder, <line> <line>hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each <line> <line>to other speedie aide might lend at need; <line> <line>whether his first design be to withdraw <line> <line>our fealtie from god, or to disturb <line> <line>conjugal love, then which perhaps no bliss <line> <line>enjoy'd by us excites his envie more; <line> <line>or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side <line> <line>that gave thee being, still shades thee and protects. <line> <line>the wife, where danger or dishonour lurks, <line> <line>safest and seemliest by her husband staies, <line> <line>who guards her, or with her the worst endures. <line> <line>to whom the virgin majestie of eve, <line> <line>as one who loves, and some unkindness meets, <line> <line>with sweet austeer composure thus reply'd, <line> <line>ofspring of heav'n and earth, and all earths lord, <line> <line>that such an enemie we have, who seeks <line> <line>our ruin, both by thee informd i learne, <line> <line>and from the parting angel over-heard <line> <line>as in a shadie nook i stood behind, <line> <line>just then returnd at shut of evening flours. <line> <line>but that thou shouldst my firmness therfore doubt <line> <line>to god or thee, because we have a foe <line> <line>may tempt it, i expected not to hear. <line> <line>his violence thou fearst not, being such, <line> <line>as wee, not capable of death or paine, <line> <line>can either not receave, or can repell. <line> <line>his fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs <line> <line>thy equal fear that my firm faith and love <line> <line>can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't; <line> <line>thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy brestadam, missthought of her to thee so dear? <line> <line>to whom with healing words adam replyd. <line> <line>daughter of god and man, immortal eve, <line> <line>for such thou art, from sin and blame entire: <line> <line>not diffident of thee do i dissuade <line> <line>thy absence from my sight, but to avoid <line> <line>th' attempt it self, intended by our foe. <line> <line>for hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses <line> <line>the tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd <line> <line>not incorruptible of faith, not prooff <line> <line>against temptation: thou thy self with scorne <line> <line>and anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong, <line> <line>though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, <line> <line>if such affront i labour to avert <line> <line>from thee alone, which on us both at once <line> <line>the enemie, though bold, will hardly dare, <line> <line>or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light. <line> <line>nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; <line> <line>suttle he needs must be, who could seduce <line> <line>angels, nor think superfluous others aid. <line> <line>i from the influence of thy looks receave <line> <line>access in every vertue, in thy sight <line> <line>more wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were <line> <line>of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, <line> <line>shame to be overcome or over-reacht <line> <line>would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite. <line> <line>why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel <line> <line>when i am present, and thy trial choose <line> <line>with me, best witness of thy vertue tri'd. <line> <line>so spake domestick adam in his care <line> <line>and matrimonial love; but eve, who thought <line> <line>less attributed to her faith sincere, <line> <line>thus her reply with accent sweet renewd. <line> <line>if this be our condition, thus to dwell <line> <line>in narrow circuit strait'nd by a foe, <line> <line>suttle or violent, we not endu'd <line> <line>single with like defence, wherever met, <line> <line>how are we happie, still in fear of harm? <line> <line>but harm precedes not sin: onely our foe <line> <line>tempting affronts us with his foul esteem <line> <line>of our integritie: his foul esteeme <line> <line>sticks no dishonour on our front, but turns <line> <line>foul on himself; then wherefore shund or feard <line> <line>by us? who rather double honour gaine <line> <line>from his surmise prov'd false, find peace within, <line> <line>favour from heav'n, our witness from th' event. <line> <line>and what is faith, love, vertue unassaid <line> <line>alone, without exterior help sustaind? <line> <line>let us not then suspect our happie state <line> <line>left so imperfet by the maker wise, <line> <line>as not secure to single or combin'd. <line> <line>fraile is our happiness, if this be so, <line> <line>and eden were no eden thus expos'd. <line> <line>to whom thus adam fervently repli'd. <line> <line>o woman, best are all things as the will <line> <line>of god ordain'd them, his creating hand <line> <line>nothing imperfet or deficient left <line> <line>of all that he created, much less man, <line> <line>or aught that might his happie state secure, <line> <line>secure from outward force; within himself <line> <line>the danger lies, yet lies within his power: <line> <line>against his will he can receave no harme. <line> <line>but god left free the will, for what obeyes <line> <line>reason, is free, and reason he made right, <line> <line>but bid her well beware, and still erect, <line> <line>least by some faire appeering good surpris'd <line> <line>she dictate false, and misinforme the will <line> <line>to do what god expressly hath forbid. <line> <line>not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes, <line> <line>that i should mind thee oft, and mind thou me. <line> <line>firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve, <line> <line>since reason not impossibly may meet <line> <line>some specious object by the foe subornd, <line> <line>and fall into deception unaware, <line> <line>not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd. <line> <line>seek not temptation then, which to avoide <line> <line>were better, and most likelie if from mee <line> <line>thou sever not: trial will come unsought. <line> <line>wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve <line> <line>first thy obedience; th' other who can know, <line> <line>not seeing thee attempted, who attest? <line> <line>but if thou think, trial unsought may finde <line> <line>us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst, <line> <line>go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; <line> <line>go in thy native innocence, relie <line> <line>on what thou hast of vertue, summon all, <line> <line>for god towards thee hath done his part, do thine. <line> <line>so spake the patriarch of mankinde, but eve <line> <line>persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd. <line> <line>with thy permission then, and thus forewarnd <line> <line>chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words <line> <line>touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought, <line> <line>may finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd, <line> <line>the willinger i goe, nor much expect <line> <line>a foe so proud will first the weaker seek; <line> <line>so bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. <line> <line>thus saying, from her husbands hand her hand <line> <line>soft she withdrew, and like a wood-nymph lightoread or dryad, or of delia's traine, <line> <line>betook her to the groves, but delia's self <line> <line>in gate surpass'd and goddess-like deport, <line> <line>though not as shee with bow and quiver armd, <line> <line>but with such gardning tools as art yet rude, <line> <line>guiltless of fire had formd, or angels brought. <line> <line>to pales, or pomona thus adornd, <line> <line>likeliest she seemd, pomona when she fledvertumnus, or to ceres in her prime, <line> <line>yet virgin of proserpina from jove. <line> <line>her long with ardent look his eye pursu'd <line> <line>delighted, but desiring more her stay. <line> <line>oft he to her his charge of quick returne <line> <line>repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd <line> <line>to be returnd by noon amid the bowre, <line> <line>and all things in best order to invite <line> <line>noontide repast, or afternoons repose. <line> <line>o much deceav'd, much failing, hapless eve, <line> <line>of thy presum'd return! event perverse! <line> <line>thou never from that houre in paradise <line> <line>foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose; <line> <line>such ambush hid among sweet flours and shades <line> <line>waited with hellish rancour imminent <line> <line>to intercept thy way, or send thee back <line> <line>despoild of innocence, of faith, of bliss. <line> <line>for now, and since first break of dawne the fiend, <line> <line>meer serpent in appearance, forth was come, <line> <line>and on his quest, where likeliest he might finde <line> <line>the onely two of mankinde, but in them <line> <line>the whole included race, his purposd prey. <line> <line>in bowre and field he sought, where any tuft <line> <line>of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay, <line> <line>thir tendance or plantation for delight, <line> <line>by fountain or by shadie rivulet <line> <line>he sought them both, but wish'd his hap might findeve separate, he wish'd, but not with hope <line> <line>of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish, <line> <line>beyond his hope, eve separate he spies, <line> <line>veild in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood, <line> <line>half spi'd, so thick the roses bushing round <line> <line>about her glowd, oft stooping to support <line> <line>each flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay <line> <line>carnation, purple, azure, or spect with gold, <line> <line>hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies <line> <line>gently with mirtle band, mindless the while, <line> <line>her self, though fairest unsupported flour, <line> <line>from her best prop so farr, and storm so nigh. <line> <line>neerer he drew, and many a walk travers'd <line> <line>of stateliest covert, cedar, pine, or palme, <line> <line>then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen <line> <line>among thick-wov'n arborets and flours <line> <line>imborderd on each bank, the hand of eve: <line> <line>spot more delicious then those gardens feign'd <line> <line>or of reviv'd adonis, or renowndalcinous, host of old laertes son, <line> <line>or that, not mystic, where the sapient king <line> <line>held dalliance with his faire egyptian spouse. <line> <line>much hee the place admir'd, the person more. <line> <line>as one who long in populous city pent, <line> <line>where houses thick and sewers annoy the aire, <line> <line>forth issuing on a summers morn to breathe <line> <line>among the pleasant villages and farmes <line> <line>adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight, <line> <line>the smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine, <line> <line>or dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound; <line> <line>if chance with nymphlike step fair virgin pass, <line> <line>what pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more, <line> <line>she most, and in her look summs all delight. <line> <line>such pleasure took the serpent to behold <line> <line>this flourie plat, the sweet recess of eve <line> <line>thus earlie, thus alone; her heav'nly forme <line> <line>angelic, but more soft, and feminine, <line> <line>her graceful innocence, her every aire <line> <line>of gesture or lest action overawd <line> <line>his malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd <line> <line>his fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: <line> <line>that space the evil one abstracted stood <line> <line>from his own evil, and for the time remaind <line> <line>stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd, <line> <line>of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge; <line> <line>but the hot hell that alwayes in him burnes, <line> <line>though in mid heav'n, soon ended his delight, <line> <line>and tortures him now more, the more he sees <line> <line>of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon <line> <line>fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts <line> <line>of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. <line> <line>thoughts, whither have ye led me, with what sweet <line> <line>compulsion thus transported to forget <line> <line>what hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope <line> <line>of paradise for hell, hope here to taste <line> <line>of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy, <line> <line>save what is in destroying, other joy <line> <line>to me is lost. then let me not let pass <line> <line>occasion which now smiles, behold alone <line> <line>the woman, opportune to all attempts, <line> <line>her husband, for i view far round, not nigh, <line> <line>whose higher intellectual more i shun, <line> <line>and strength, of courage hautie, and of limb <line> <line>heroic built, though of terrestrial mould, <line> <line>foe not informidable, exempt from wound, <line> <line>i not; so much hath hell debas'd, and paine <line> <line>infeebl'd me, to what i was in heav'n. <line> <line>shee fair, divinely fair, fit love for gods, <line> <line>not terrible, though terrour be in love <line> <line>and beautie, not approacht by stronger hate, <line> <line>hate stronger, under shew of love well feign'd, <line> <line>the way which to her ruin now i tend. <line> <line>so spake the enemie of mankind, enclos'd <line> <line>in serpent, inmate bad, and toward eve <line> <line>address'd his way, not with indented wave, <line> <line>prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare, <line> <line>circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd <line> <line>fould above fould a surging maze, his head <line> <line>crested aloft, and carbuncle his eyes; <line> <line>with burnisht neck of verdant gold, erect <line> <line>amidst his circling spires, that on the grass <line> <line>floted redundant: pleasing was his shape, <line> <line>and lovely, never since of serpent kind <line> <line>lovelier, not those that in illyria chang'dhermione and cadmus, or the god <line> <line>in epidaurus; nor to which transformdammonian jove, or capitoline was seen, <line> <line>hee with olympias, this with her who borescipio the highth of rome. with tract oblique <line> <line>at first, as one who sought access, but feard <line> <line>to interrupt, side-long he works his way. <line> <line>as when a ship by skilful stearsman wrought <line> <line>nigh rivers mouth or foreland, where the wind <line> <line>veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her saile; <line> <line>so varied hee, and of his tortuous traine <line> <line>curld many a wanton wreath in sight of eve, <line> <line>to lure her eye; shee busied heard the sound <line> <line>of rusling leaves, but minded not, as us'd <line> <line>to such disport before her through the field, <line> <line>from every beast, more duteous at her call, <line> <line>then at circean call the herd disguis'd. <line> <line>hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood; <line> <line>but as in gaze admiring: oft he bowd <line> <line>his turret crest, and sleek enamel'd neck, <line> <line>fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod. <line> <line>his gentle dumb expression turnd at length <line> <line>the eye of eve to mark his play; he glad <line> <line>of her attention gaind, with serpent tongue <line> <line>organic, or impulse of vocal air, <line> <line>his fraudulent temptation thus began. <line> <line>wonder not, sovran mistress, if perhaps <line> <line>thou canst, who art sole wonder, much less arm <line> <line>thy looks, the heav'n of mildness, with disdain, <line> <line>displeas'd that i approach thee thus, and gaze <line> <line>insatiate, i thus single, nor have feard <line> <line>thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd. <line> <line>fairest resemblance of thy maker faire, <line> <line>thee all things living gaze on, all things thine <line> <line>by gift, and thy celestial beautie adore <line> <line>with ravishment beheld, there best beheld <line> <line>where universally admir'd; but here <line> <line>in this enclosure wild, these beasts among, <line> <line>beholders rude, and shallow to discerne <line> <line>half what in thee is fair, one man except, <line> <line>who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen <line> <line>a goddess among gods, ador'd and serv'd <line> <line>by angels numberless, thy daily train. <line> <line>so gloz'd the tempter, and his proem tun'd; <line> <line>into the heart of eve his words made way, <line> <line>though at the voice much marveling; at length <line> <line>not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake. <line> <line>what may this mean? language of man pronounc't <line> <line>by tongue of brute, and human sense exprest? <line> <line>the first at lest of these i thought deni'd <line> <line>to beasts, whom god on thir creation-day <line> <line>created mute to all articulat sound; <line> <line>the latter i demurre, for in thir looks <line> <line>much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers. <line> <line>thee, serpent, suttlest beast of all the field <line> <line>i knew, but not with human voice endu'd; <line> <line>redouble then this miracle, and say, <line> <line>how cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how <line> <line>to me so friendly grown above the rest <line> <line>of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? <line> <line>say, for such wonder claims attention due. <line> <line>to whom the guileful tempter thus reply'd. <line> <line>empress of this fair world, resplendent eve, <line> <line>easie to mee it is to tell thee all <line> <line>what thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd: <line> <line>i was at first as other beasts that graze <line> <line>the trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low, <line> <line>as was my food, nor aught but food discern'd <line> <line>or sex, and apprehended nothing high: <line> <line>till on a day roaving the field, i chanc'd <line> <line>a goodly tree farr distant to behold <line> <line>loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt, <line> <line>ruddie and gold: i nearer drew to gaze; <line> <line>when from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n, <line> <line>grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense <line> <line>then smell of sweetest fenel or the teats <line> <line>of ewe or goat dropping with milk at eevn, <line> <line>unsuckt of lamb or kid, that tend thir play. <line> <line>to satisfie the sharp desire i had <line> <line>of tasting those fair apples, i resolv'd <line> <line>not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once, <line> <line>powerful perswaders, quick'nd at the scent <line> <line>of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene. <line> <line>about the mossie trunk i wound me soon, <line> <line>for high from ground the branches would require <line> <line>thy utmost reach or adams: round the tree <line> <line>all other beasts that saw, with like desire <line> <line>longing and envying stood, but could not reach. <line> <line>amid the tree now got, where plenty hung <line> <line>tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill <line> <line>i spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour <line> <line>at feed or fountain never had i found. <line> <line>sated at length, ere long i might perceave <line> <line>strange alteration in me, to degree <line> <line>of reason in my inward powers, and speech <line> <line>wanted not long, though to this shape retain'd. <line> <line>thenceforth to speculations high or deep <line> <line>i turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind <line> <line>considerd all things visible in heav'n, <line> <line>or earth, or middle, all things fair and good; <line> <line>but all that fair and good in thy divine <line> <line>semblance, and in thy beauties heav'nly ray <line> <line>united i beheld; no fair to thine <line> <line>equivalent or second, which compel'd <line> <line>mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come <line> <line>and gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd <line> <line>sovran of creatures, universal dame. <line> <line>so talk'd the spirited sly snake; and eve <line> <line>yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd. <line> <line>serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt <line> <line>the vertue of that fruit, in thee first prov'd: <line> <line>but say, where grows the tree, from hence how far? <line> <line>for many are the trees of god that grow <line> <line>in paradise, and various, yet unknown <line> <line>to us, in such aboundance lies our choice, <line> <line>as leaves a greater store of fruit untoucht, <line> <line>still hanging incorruptible, till men <line> <line>grow up to thir provision, and more hands <line> <line>help to disburden nature of her bearth. <line> <line>to whom the wilie adder, blithe and glad. <line> <line>empress, the way is readie, and not long, <line> <line>beyond a row of myrtles, on a flat, <line> <line>fast by a fountain, one small thicket past <line> <line>of blowing myrrh and balme; if thou accept <line> <line>my conduct, i can bring thee thither soon. <line> <line>lead then, said eve. hee leading swiftly rowld <line> <line>in tangles, and made intricate seem strait, <line> <line>to mischief swift. hope elevates, and joy <line> <line>bright'ns his crest, as when a wandring fire, <line> <line>compact of unctuous vapor, which the night <line> <line>condenses, and the cold invirons round, <line> <line>kindl'd through agitation to a flame, <line> <line>which oft, they say, some evil spirit attends <line> <line>hovering and blazing with delusive light, <line> <line>misleads th' amaz'd night-wanderer from his way <line> <line>to boggs and mires, and oft through pond or poole, <line> <line>there swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr. <line> <line>so glister'd the dire snake, and into fraud <line> <line>led eve our credulous mother, to the tree <line> <line>of prohibition, root of all our woe; <line> <line>which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. <line> <line>serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither, <line> <line>fruitless to mee, though fruit be here to excess, <line> <line>the credit of whose vertue rest with thee, <line> <line>wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects. <line> <line>but of this tree we may not taste nor touch; <line> <line>god so commanded, and left that command <line> <line>sole daughter of his voice; the rest, we live <line> <line>law to our selves, our reason is our law. <line> <line>to whom the tempter guilefully repli'd. <line> <line>indeed? hath god then said that of the fruit <line> <line>of all these garden trees ye shall not eate, <line> <line>yet lords declar'd of all in earth or aire? <line> <line>to whom thus eve yet sinless. of the fruit <line> <line>of each tree in the garden we may eate, <line> <line>but of the fruit of this fair tree amidst <line> <line>the garden, god hath said, ye shall not eate <line> <line>thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die. <line> <line>she scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold <line> <line>the tempter, but with shew of zeale and love <line> <line>to man, and indignation at his wrong, <line> <line>new part puts on, and as to passion mov'd, <line> <line>fluctuats disturbd, yet comely and in act <line> <line>rais'd, as of som great matter to begin. <line> <line>as when of old som orator renound <line> <line>in athens or free rome, where eloquence <line> <line>flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest, <line> <line>stood in himself collected, while each part, <line> <line>motion, each act won audience ere the tongue, <line> <line>somtimes in highth began, as no delay <line> <line>of preface brooking through his zeal of right. <line> <line>so standing, moving, or to highth upgrown <line> <line>the tempter all impassiond thus began. <line> <line>o sacred, wise, and wisdom-giving plant, <line> <line>mother of science, now i feel thy power <line> <line>within me cleere, not onely to discerne <line> <line>things in thir causes, but to trace the wayes <line> <line>of highest agents, deemd however wise. <line> <line>queen of this universe, doe not believe <line> <line>those rigid threats of death; ye shall not die: <line> <line>how should ye? by the fruit? it gives you life <line> <line>to knowledge? by the threatner, look on mee, <line> <line>mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live, <line> <line>and life more perfet have attaind then fate <line> <line>meant mee, by ventring higher then my lot. <line> <line>shall that be shut to man, which to the beast <line> <line>is open? or will god incense his ire <line> <line>for such a petty trespass, and not praise <line> <line>rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain <line> <line>of death denounc't, whatever thing death be, <line> <line>deterrd not from atchieving what might leade <line> <line>to happier life, knowledge of good and evil; <line> <line>of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil <line> <line>be real, why not known, since easier shunnd? <line> <line>god therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; <line> <line>not just, not god; not feard then, nor obeyd: <line> <line>your feare it self of death removes the feare. <line> <line>why then was this forbid? why but to awe, <line> <line>why but to keep ye low and ignorant, <line> <line>his worshippers; he knows that in the day <line> <line>ye eate thereof, your eyes that seem so cleere, <line> <line>yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then <line> <line>op'nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as gods, <line> <line>knowing both good and evil as they know. <line> <line>that ye should be as gods, since i as man, <line> <line>internal man, is but proportion meet, <line> <line>i of brute human, yee of human gods. <line> <line>so ye shall die perhaps, by putting off <line> <line>human, to put on gods, death to be wisht, <line> <line>though threat'nd, which no worse then this can bring. <line> <line>and what are gods that man may not become <line> <line>as they, participating god-like food? <line> <line>the gods are first, and that advantage use <line> <line>on our belief, that all from them proceeds; <line> <line>i question it, for this fair earth i see, <line> <line>warm'd by the sun, producing every kind, <line> <line>them nothing: if they all things, who enclos'd <line> <line>knowledge of good and evil in this tree, <line> <line>that whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains <line> <line>wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies <line> <line>th' offence, that man should thus attain to know? <line> <line>what can your knowledge hurt him, or this tree <line> <line>impart against his will if all be his? <line> <line>or is it envie, and can envie dwell <line> <line>in heav'nly breasts? these, these and many more <line> <line>causes import your need of this fair fruit. <line> <line>goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste. <line> <line>he ended, and his words replete with guile <line> <line>into her heart too easie entrance won: <line> <line>fixt on the fruit she gaz'd, which to behold <line> <line>might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound <line> <line>yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn'd <line> <line>with reason, to her seeming, and with truth; <line> <line>mean while the hour of noon drew on, and wak'd <line> <line>an eager appetite, rais'd by the smell <line> <line>so savorie of that fruit, which with desire, <line> <line>inclinable now grown to touch or taste, <line> <line>sollicited her longing eye; yet first <line> <line>pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd. <line> <line>great are thy vertues, doubtless, best of fruits, <line> <line>though kept from man, and worthy to be admir'd, <line> <line>whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay <line> <line>gave elocution to the mute, and taught <line> <line>the tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise: <line> <line>thy praise hee also who forbids thy use, <line> <line>conceales not from us, naming thee the tree <line> <line>of knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil; <line> <line>forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding <line> <line>commends thee more, while it inferrs the good <line> <line>by thee communicated, and our want: <line> <line>for good unknown, sure is not had, or had <line> <line>and yet unknown, is as not had at all. <line> <line>in plain then, what forbids he but to know, <line> <line>forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? <line> <line>such prohibitions binde not. but if death <line> <line>bind us with after-bands, what profits then <line> <line>our inward freedom? in the day we eate <line> <line>of this fair fruit, our doom is, we shall die. <line> <line>how dies the serpent? hee hath eat'n and lives, <line> <line>and knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns, <line> <line>irrational till then. for us alone <line> <line>was death invented? or to us deni'd <line> <line>this intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd? <line> <line>for beasts it seems: yet that one beast which first <line> <line>hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy <line> <line>the good befall'n him, author unsuspect, <line> <line>friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile. <line> <line>what fear i then, rather what know to feare <line> <line>under this ignorance of good and evil, <line> <line>of god or death, of law or penaltie? <line> <line>here grows the cure of all, this fruit divine, <line> <line>fair to the eye, inviting to the taste, <line> <line>of vertue to make wise: what hinders then <line> <line>to reach, and feed at once both bodie and mind? <line> <line>so saying, her rash hand in evil hour <line> <line>forth reaching to the fruit, she pluck'd, she eat: <line> <line>earth felt the wound, and nature from her seat <line> <line>sighing through all her works gave signs of woe, <line> <line>that all was lost. back to the thicket slunk <line> <line>the guiltie serpent, and well might, for eve <line> <line>intent now wholly on her taste, naught else <line> <line>regarded, such delight till then, as seemd, <line> <line>in fruit she never tasted, whether true <line> <line>or fansied so, through expectation high <line> <line>of knowledg, nor was god-head from her thought. <line> <line>greedily she ingorg'd without restraint, <line> <line>and knew not eating death: satiate at length, <line> <line>and hight'nd as with wine, jocond and boon, <line> <line>thus to her self she pleasingly began. <line> <line>o sovran, vertuous, precious of all trees <line> <line>in paradise, of operation blest <line> <line>to sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd, <line> <line>and thy fair fruit let hang, as to no end <line> <line>created; but henceforth my early care, <line> <line>not without song, each morning, and due praise <line> <line>shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease <line> <line>of thy full branches offer'd free to all; <line> <line>till dieted by thee i grow mature <line> <line>in knowledge, as the gods who all things know; <line> <line>though others envie what they cannot give; <line> <line>for had the gift bin theirs, it had not here <line> <line>thus grown. experience, next to thee i owe, <line> <line>best guide; not following thee, i had remaind <line> <line>in ignorance, thou op'nst wisdoms way, <line> <line>and giv'st access, though secret she retire. <line> <line>and i perhaps am secret; heav'n is high, <line> <line>high and remote to see from thence distinct <line> <line>each thing on earth; and other care perhaps <line> <line>may have diverted from continual watch <line> <line>our great forbidder, safe with all his spies <line> <line>about him. but to adam in what sort <line> <line>shall i appeer? shall i to him make known <line> <line>as yet my change, and give him to partake <line> <line>full happiness with mee, or rather not, <line> <line>but keep the odds of knowledge in my power <line> <line>without copartner? so to add what wants <line> <line>in femal sex, the more to draw his love, <line> <line>and render me more equal, and perhaps, <line> <line>a thing not undesireable, somtime <line> <line>superior; for inferior who is free? <line> <line>this may be well: but what if god have seen, <line> <line>and death ensue? then i shall be no more, <line> <line>and adam wedded to another eve, <line> <line>shall live with her enjoying, i extinct; <line> <line>a death to think. confirm'd then i resolve;adam shall share with me in bliss or woe: <line> <line>so dear i love him, that with him all deaths <line> <line>i could endure, without him live no life. <line> <line>so saying, from the tree her step she turnd, <line> <line>but first low reverence don, as to the power <line> <line>that dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd <line> <line>into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd <line> <line>from nectar, drink of gods. adam the while <line> <line>waiting desirous her return, had wove <line> <line>of choicest flours a garland to adorne <line> <line>her tresses, and her rural labours crown, <line> <line>as reapers oft are wont thir harvest queen. <line> <line>great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new <line> <line>solace in her return, so long delay'd; <line> <line>yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill, <line> <line>misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt; <line> <line>and forth to meet her went, the way she took <line> <line>that morn when first they parted; by the tree <line> <line>of knowledge he must pass, there he her met, <line> <line>scarse from the tree returning; in her hand <line> <line>a bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd, <line> <line>new gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd. <line> <line>to him she hasted, in her face excuse <line> <line>came prologue, and apologie to prompt, <line> <line>which with bland words at will she thus addrest. <line> <line>hast thou not wonderd, adam, at my stay? <line> <line>thee i have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd <line> <line>thy presence, agonie of love till now <line> <line>not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more <line> <line>mean i to trie, what rash untri'd i sought, <line> <line>the pain of absence from thy sight. but strange <line> <line>hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare: <line> <line>this tree is not as we are told, a tree <line> <line>of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown <line> <line>op'ning the way, but of divine effect <line> <line>to open eyes, and make them gods who taste; <line> <line>and hath bin tasted such: the serpent wise, <line> <line>or not restraind as wee, or not obeying, <line> <line>hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become, <line> <line>not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth <line> <line>endu'd with human voice and human sense, <line> <line>reasoning to admiration, and with mee <line> <line>perswasively hath so prevaild, that i <line> <line>have also tasted, and have also found <line> <line>th' effects to correspond, opener mine eyes, <line> <line>dimm erst, dilated spirits, ampler heart, <line> <line>and growing up to godhead; which for thee <line> <line>chiefly i sought, without thee can despise. <line> <line>for bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss, <line> <line>tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon. <line> <line>thou therefore also taste, that equal lot <line> <line>may joyne us, equal joy, as equal love; <line> <line>least thou not tasting, different degree <line> <line>disjoyne us, and i then too late renounce <line> <line>deitie for thee, when fate will not permit. <line> <line>thus eve with countnance blithe her storie told; <line> <line>but in her cheek distemper flushing glowd. <line> <line>on th' other side, adam, soon as he heard <line> <line>the fatal trespass don by eve, amaz'd, <line> <line>astonied stood and blank, while horror chill <line> <line>ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd; <line> <line>from his slack hand the garland wreath'd for eve <line> <line>down drop'd, and all the faded roses shed: <line> <line>speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length <line> <line>first to himself he inward silence broke. <line> <line>o fairest of creation, last and best <line> <line>of all gods works, creature in whom excell'd <line> <line>whatever can to sight or thought be formd, <line> <line>holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! <line> <line>how art thou lost, how on a sudden lost, <line> <line>defac't, deflourd, and now to death devote? <line> <line>rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress <line> <line>the strict forbiddance, how to violate <line> <line>the sacred fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud <line> <line>of enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown, <line> <line>and mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee <line> <line>certain my resolution is to die; <line> <line>how can i live without thee, how forgoe <line> <line>thy sweet converse and love so dearly joyn'd, <line> <line>to live again in these wilde woods forlorn? <line> <line>should god create another eve, and i <line> <line>another rib afford, yet loss of thee <line> <line>would never from my heart; no no, i feel <line> <line>the link of nature draw me: flesh of flesh, <line> <line>bone of my bone thou art, and from thy state <line> <line>mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. <line> <line>so having said, as one from sad dismay <line> <line>recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd <line> <line>submitting to what seemd remediless, <line> <line>thus in calm mood his words to eve he turnd. <line> <line>bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous eve, <line> <line>and peril great provok't, who thus hath dar'd <line> <line>had it been onely coveting to eye <line> <line>that sacred fruit, sacred to abstinence, <line> <line>much more to taste it under banne to touch. <line> <line>but past who can recall, or don undoe? <line> <line>not god omnipotent, nor fate, yet so <line> <line>perhaps thou shalt not die, perhaps the fact <line> <line>is not so hainous now, foretasted fruit, <line> <line>profan'd first by the serpent, by him first <line> <line>made common and unhallowd ere our taste; <line> <line>nor yet on him found deadly, he yet lives, <line> <line>lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as man <line> <line>higher degree of life, inducement strong <line> <line>to us, as likely tasting to attaine <line> <line>proportional ascent, which cannot be <line> <line>but to be gods, or angels demi-gods. <line> <line>nor can i think that god, creator wise, <line> <line>though threatning, will in earnest so destroy <line> <line>us his prime creatures, dignifi'd so high, <line> <line>set over all his works, which in our fall, <line> <line>for us created, needs with us must faile, <line> <line>dependent made; so god shall uncreate, <line> <line>be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose, <line> <line>not well conceav'd of god, who though his power <line> <line>creation could repeate, yet would be loath <line> <line>us to abolish, least the adversary <line> <line>triumph and say; fickle their state whom god <line> <line>most favors, who can please him long; mee first <line> <line>he ruind, now mankind; whom will he next? <line> <line>matter of scorne, not to be given the foe, <line> <line>however i with thee have fixt my lot, <line> <line>certain to undergoe like doom, if death <line> <line>consort with thee, death is to mee as life; <line> <line>so forcible within my heart i feel <line> <line>the bond of nature draw me to my owne, <line> <line>my own in thee, for what thou art is mine; <line> <line>our state cannot be severd, we are one, <line> <line>one flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self. <line> <line>so adam, and thus eve to him repli'd. <line> <line>o glorious trial of exceeding love, <line> <line>illustrious evidence, example high! <line> <line>ingaging me to emulate, but short <line> <line>of thy perfection, how shall i attaine, <line> <line>adam, from whose deare side i boast me sprung, <line> <line>and gladly of our union heare thee speak, <line> <line>one heart, one soul in both; whereof good prooff <line> <line>this day affords, declaring thee resolvd, <line> <line>rather then death or aught then death more dread <line> <line>shall separate us, linkt in love so deare, <line> <line>to undergoe with mee one guilt, one crime, <line> <line>if any be, of tasting this fair fruit, <line> <line>whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds, <line> <line>direct, or by occasion hath presented <line> <line>this happie trial of thy love, which else <line> <line>so eminently never had bin known. <line> <line>were it i thought death menac't would ensue <line> <line>this my attempt, i would sustain alone <line> <line>the worst, and not perswade thee, rather die <line> <line>deserted, then oblige thee with a fact <line> <line>pernicious to thy peace, chiefly assur'd <line> <line>remarkably so late of thy so true, <line> <line>so faithful love unequald; but i feel <line> <line>farr otherwise th' event, not death, but life <line> <line>augmented, op'nd eyes, new hopes, new joyes, <line> <line>taste so divine, that what of sweet before <line> <line>hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh. <line> <line>on my experience, adam, freely taste, <line> <line>and fear of death deliver to the windes. <line> <line>so saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy <line> <line>tenderly wept, much won that he his love <line> <line>had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr <line> <line>divine displeasure for her sake, or death. <line> <line>in recompence (for such compliance bad <line> <line>such recompence best merits) from the bough <line> <line>she gave him of that fair enticing fruit <line> <line>with liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat <line> <line>against his better knowledge, not deceav'd, <line> <line>but fondly overcome with femal charm. <line> <line>earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again <line> <line>in pangs, and nature gave a second groan, <line> <line>skie lowr'd and muttering thunder, som sad drops <line> <line>wept at compleating of the mortal sin <line> <line>original; while adam took no thought, <line> <line>eating his fill, nor eve to iterate <line> <line>her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe <line> <line>him with her lov'd societie, that now <line> <line>as with new wine intoxicated both <line> <line>they swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel <line> <line>divinitie within them breeding wings <line> <line>wherewith to scorne the earth: but that false fruit <line> <line>farr other operation first displaid, <line> <line>carnal desire enflaming, hee on eve <line> <line>began to cast lascivious eyes, she him <line> <line>as wantonly repaid; in lust they burne: <line> <line>till adam thus'gan eve to dalliance move,eve, now i see thou art exact of taste, <line> <line>and elegant, of sapience no small part, <line> <line>since to each meaning savour we apply, <line> <line>and palate call judicious; i the praise <line> <line>yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd. <line> <line>much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd <line> <line>from this delightful fruit, nor known till now <line> <line>true relish, tasting;

""thus,"" said he, ""will we build this ship! lay square the blocks upon the slip, and follow well this plan of mine. choose the timbers with greatest care; of all that is unsound beware; for only what is sound and strong to this vessel shall belong. cedar of maine and georgia pine here together shall combine. a goodly frame, and a goodly fame, and the union be her name! for the day that gives her to the sea shall give my daughter unto thee!"" the master's word enraptured the young man heard; and as he turned his face aside, with a look of joy and a thrill of pride standing before her father's door, he saw the form of his promised bride. the sun shone on her golden hair, and her cheek was glowing fresh and fair, with the breath of morn and the soft sea air. like a beauteous barge was she, still at rest on the sandy beach, just beyond the billow's reach; but he was the restless, seething, stormy sea! ah, how skilful grows the hand that obeyeth love's command! it is the heart, and not the brain, that to the highest doth attain, and he who followeth love's behest far excelleth all the rest! thus with the rising of the sun was the noble task begun, and soon throughout the ship-yard's bounds were heard the intermingled sounds of axes and of mallets, plied with vigorous arms on every side; plied so deftly and so well, that, ere the shadows of evening fell, the keel of oak for a noble ship, scarfed and bolted, straight and strong, was lying ready, and stretched along the blocks, well placed upon the slip. happy, thrice happy, every one who sees his labor well begun, and not perplexed and multiplied, by idly waiting for time and tide! and when the hot, long day was o'er, the young man at the master's door sat with the maiden calm and still, and within the porch, a little more removed beyond the evening chill, the father sat, and told them tales of wrecks in the great september gales, of pirates coasting the spanish main, and ships that never came back again, the chance and change of a sailor's life, want and plenty, rest and strife, his roving fancy, like the wind, that nothing can stay and nothing can bind, and the magic charm of foreign lands, with shadows of palms, and shining sands, where the tumbling surf, o'er the coral reefs of madagascar, washes the feet of the swarthy lascar, as he lies alone and asleep on the turf. and the trembling maiden held her breath at the tales of that awful, pitiless sea, with all its terror and mystery, the dim, dark sea, so like unto death, that divides and yet unites mankind! and whenever the old man paused, a gleam from the bowl of his pipe would awhile illume the silent group in the twilight gloom, and thoughtful faces, as in a dream; and for a moment one might mark what had been hidden by the dark, that the head of the maiden lay at rest, tenderly, on the young man's breast! day by day the vessel grew, with timbers fashioned strong and true, stemson and keelson and sternson-knee, till, framed with perfect symmetry, a skeleton ship rose up to view! and around the bows and along the side the heavy hammers and mallets plied, till after many a week, at length, wonderful for form and strength, sublime in its enormous bulk, loomed aloft the shadowy hulk! and around it columns of smoke, upwreathing, rose from the boiling, bubbling, seething caldron, that glowed, and overflowed with the black tar, heated for the sheathing. and amid the clamors of clattering hammers, he who listened heard now and then the song of the master and his men: — ""build me straight, o worthy master, staunch and strong, a goodly vessel, that shall laugh at all disaster, and with wave and whirlwind wrestle!"" with oaken brace and copper band, lay the rudder on the sand, that, like a thought, should have control over the movement of the whole; and near it the anchor, whose giant hand would reach down and grapple with the land, and immovable and fast hold the great ship against the bellowing blast! and at the bows an image stood, by a cunning artist carved in wood, with robes of white, that far behind seemed to be fluttering in the wind. it was not shaped in a classic mould, not like a nymph or goddess of old, or naiad rising from the water, but modelled from the master's daughter! on many a dreary and misty night, 't will be seen by the rays of the signal light, speeding along through the rain and the dark, like a ghost in its snow-white sark, the pilot of some phantom bark, guiding the vessel, in its flight, by a path none other knows aright! behold, at last, each tall and tapering mast is swung into its place; shrouds and stays holding it firm and fast! long ago, in the deer-haunted forests of maine, when upon mountain and plain lay the snow, they fell, — those lordly pines! those grand, majestic pines! 'mid shouts and cheers the jaded steers, panting beneath the goad, dragged down the weary, winding road those captive kings so straight and tall, to be shorn of their streaming hair, and naked and bare, to feel the stress and the strain of the wind and the reeling main, whose roar would remind them forevermore of their native forests they should not see again. and everywhere the slender, graceful spars poise aloft in the air, and at the mast-head, white, blue, and red, a flag unrolls the stripes and stars. ah! when the wanderer, lonely, friendless, in foreign harbors shall behold that flag unrolled, 't will be as a friendly hand stretched out from his native land, filling his heart with memories sweet and endless! all is finished! and at length has come the bridal day of beauty and of strength. to-day the vessel shall be launched! with fleecy clouds the sky is blanched, and o'er the bay, slowly, in all his splendors dight, the great sun rises to behold the sight. the ocean old, centuries old, strong as youth, and as uncontrolled, paces restless to and fro, up and down the sands of gold. his beating heart is not at rest; and far and wide, with ceaseless flow, his beard of snow heaves with the heaving of his breast. he waits impatient for his bride. there she stands, with her foot upon the sands, decked with flags and streamers gay, in honor of her marriage day, her snow-white signals fluttering, blending, round her like a veil descending, ready to be the bride of the gray old sea. on the deck another bride is standing by her lover's side. shadows from the flags and shrouds, like the shadows cast by clouds, broken by many a sunny fleck, fall around them on the deck. the prayer is said, the service read, the joyous bridegroom bows his head; and in tears the good old master shakes the brown hand of his son, kisses his daughter's glowing cheek in silence, for he cannot speak, and ever faster down his own the tears begin to run. the worthy pastor — the shepherd of that wandering flock, that has the ocean for its wold, that has the vessel for its fold, leaping ever from rock to rock — spake, with accents mild and clear, words of warning, words of cheer, but tedious to the bridegroom's ear. he knew the chart of the sailor's heart, all its pleasures and its griefs, all its shallows and rocky reefs, all those secret currents, that flow with such resistless undertow, and lift and drift, with terrible force, the will from its moorings and its course. therefore he spake, and thus said he: — ""like unto ships far off at sea, outward or homeward bound, are we. before, behind, and all around, floats and swings the horizon's bound, seems at its distant rim to rise and climb the crystal wall of the skies, and then again to turn and sink, as if we could slide from its outer brink. ah! it is not the sea, it is not the sea that sinks and shelves, but ourselves that rock and rise with endless and uneasy motion, now touching the very skies, now sinking into the depths of ocean. ah! if our souls but poise and swing like the compass in its brazen ring, ever level and ever true to the toil and the task we have to do, we shall sail securely, and safely reach the fortunate isles, on whose shining beach the sights we see, and the sounds we hear, will be those of joy and not of fear!"" then the master, with a gesture of command, waved his hand; and at the word, loud and sudden there was heard, all around them and below, the sound of hammers, blow on blow, knocking away the shores and spurs. and see! she stirs! she starts, — she moves, — she seems to feel the thrill of life along her keel, and, spurning with her foot the ground, with one exulting, joyous bound, she leaps into the ocean's arms! and lo! from the assembled crowd there rose a shout, prolonged and loud, that to the ocean seemed to say, ""take her, o bridegroom, old and gray, take her to thy protecting arms, with all her youth and all her charms!"" how beautiful she is! how fair she lies within those arms, that press her form with many a soft caress of tenderness and watchful care! sail forth into the sea, o ship! through wind and wave, right onward steer! the moistened eye, the trembling lip, are not the signs of doubt or fear. sail forth into the sea of life, o gentle, loving, trusting wife, and safe from all adversity upon the bosom of that sea thy comings and thy goings be! for gentleness and love and trust prevail o'er angry wave and gust; and in the wreck of noble lives something immortal still survives! thou, too, sail on, o ship of state! sail on, o union, strong and great! humanity with all its fears, with all the hopes of future years, is hanging breathless on thy fate! we know what master laid thy keel, what workmen wrought thy ribs of steel, who made each mast, and sail, and rope, what anvils rang, what hammers beat, in what a forge and what a heat were shaped the anchors of thy hope! fear not each sudden sound and shock, 't is of the wave and not the rock; 't is but the flapping of the sail, and not a rent made by the gale! in spite of rock and tempest's roar, in spite of false lights on the shore, sail on, nor fear to breast the sea! our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee, our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears, our faith triumphant o'er our fears, are all with thee, — are all with thee! <line>","activities,travels & journeys,nature,seas, rivers, & streams"

there under ebon shades, and low-brow'd rocks, as ragged as thy locks, in dark cimmerian desert ever dwell. but come thou goddess fair and free, in heav'n yclep'd euphrosyne, and by men, heart-easing mirth, whom lovely venus at a birth with two sister graces more to ivy-crowned bacchus bore; or whether (as some sager sing) the frolic wind that breathes the spring, zephyr, with aurora playing, as he met her once a-maying, there on beds of violets blue, and fresh-blown roses wash'd in dew, fill'd her with thee, a daughter fair, so buxom, blithe, and debonair. haste thee nymph, and bring with thee jest and youthful jollity, quips and cranks, and wanton wiles, nods, and becks, and wreathed smiles, such as hang on hebe's cheek, and love to live in dimple sleek; sport that wrinkled care derides, and laughter holding both his sides. come, and trip it as ye go on the light fantastic toe, and in thy right hand lead with thee, the mountain-nymph, sweet liberty; and if i give thee honour due, mirth, admit me of thy crew to live with her, and live with thee, in unreproved pleasures free; to hear the lark begin his flight, and singing startle the dull night, from his watch-tower in the skies, till the dappled dawn doth rise; then to come in spite of sorrow, and at my window bid good-morrow, through the sweet-briar, or the vine, or the twisted eglantine; while the cock with lively din, scatters the rear of darkness thin, and to the stack, or the barn door, stoutly struts his dames before; oft list'ning how the hounds and horn cheerly rouse the slumb'ring morn, from the side of some hoar hill, through the high wood echoing shrill. sometime walking, not unseen, by hedge-row elms, on hillocks green, right against the eastern gate, where the great sun begins his state, rob'd in flames, and amber light, the clouds in thousand liveries dight. while the ploughman near at hand, whistles o'er the furrow'd land, and the milkmaid singeth blithe, and the mower whets his scythe, and every shepherd tells his tale under the hawthorn in the dale. straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures whilst the landskip round it measures, russet lawns, and fallows gray, where the nibbling flocks do stray; mountains on whose barren breast the labouring clouds do often rest; meadows trim with daisies pied, shallow brooks, and rivers wide. towers, and battlements it sees bosom'd high in tufted trees, where perhaps some beauty lies, the cynosure of neighbouring eyes. hard by, a cottage chimney smokes, from betwixt two aged oaks, where corydon and thyrsis met, are at their savoury dinner set of herbs, and other country messes, which the neat-handed phyllis dresses; and then in haste her bow'r she leaves, with thestylis to bind the sheaves; or if the earlier season lead to the tann'd haycock in the mead. sometimes with secure delight the upland hamlets will invite, when the merry bells ring round, and the jocund rebecks sound to many a youth, and many a maid, dancing in the chequer'd shade; and young and old come forth to play on a sunshine holiday, till the live-long daylight fail; then to the spicy nut-brown ale, with stories told of many a feat, how faery mab the junkets eat, she was pinch'd and pull'd she said, and he by friar's lanthorn led, tells how the drudging goblin sweat, to earn his cream-bowl duly set, when in one night, ere glimpse of morn, his shadowy flail hath thresh'd the corn that ten day-labourers could not end; then lies him down, the lubber fiend, and stretch'd out all the chimney's length, basks at the fire his hairy strength; and crop-full out of doors he flings, ere the first cock his matin rings. thus done the tales, to bed they creep, by whispering winds soon lull'd asleep. tower'd cities please us then, and the busy hum of men, where throngs of knights and barons bold, in weeds of peace high triumphs hold, with store of ladies, whose bright eyes rain influence, and judge the prize of wit, or arms, while both contend to win her grace, whom all commend. there let hymen oft appear in saffron robe, with taper clear, and pomp, and feast, and revelry, with mask, and antique pageantry; such sights as youthful poets dream on summer eves by haunted stream. then to the well-trod stage anon, if jonson's learned sock be on, or sweetest shakespeare, fancy's child, warble his native wood-notes wild. and ever against eating cares, lap me in soft lydian airs, married to immortal verse, such as the meeting soul may pierce in notes with many a winding bout of linked sweetness long drawn out, with wanton heed, and giddy cunning, the melting voice through mazes running, untwisting all the chains that tie the hidden soul of harmony;

<line> <line> <line>the rest is simple. is she not too fair <line> <line> <line>even to think of maiden's sweetest care? <line> <line> <line>the mouth and brow are contrasts. one so fraught <line> <line> <line>with pride, the melancholy pride of thought <line> <line> <line>conscious of power, and yet forced to know <line> <line> <line>how little way such power as that can go; <line> <line> <line>regretting, while too proud of the fine mind, <line> <line> <line>which raises but to part it from its kind: <line> <line> <line>but the sweet mouth had nothing of all this; <line> <line> <line>it was a mouth the rose had lean'd to kiss <line> <line> <line>for her young sister, telling, now though mute, <line> <line> <line>how soft an echo it was to the lute. <line> <line> <line>the one spoke genius, in its high revealing; <line> <line> <line>the other smiled a woman's gentle feeling. <line> <line> <line>it was a lovely face: the greek outline <line> <line> <line>flowing, yet delicate and feminine; <line> <line> <line>the glorious lightning of the kindled eye, <line> <line> <line>raised, as it communed with its native sky. <line> <line> <line>a lovely face the spirit's fitting shrine; <line> <line> <line>the one almost, the other quite divine. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>my hand is on the lyre which never more <line> <line>with its sweet commerce, like a bosom friend, <line> <line>will share the deeper thoughts which i could trust <line> <line>only to music and to solitude. <line> <line>it is the very grove, the olive grove, <line> <line>where first i laid my laurel crown aside, <line> <line>and bathed my fever'd brow in the cold stream; <line> <line>as if that i could wash away the fire <line> <line>which from that moment kindled in my heart. <line> <line>i well remember how i flung myself, <line> <line>like a young goddess, on a purple cloud <line> <line>of light and odour — the rich violets <line> <line>were so ethereal in bloom and breath: <line> <line>and i — i felt immortal, for my brain <line> <line>was drunk and mad with its first draught of fame. <line> <line>'tis strange there was one only cypress tree, <line> <line>and then, as now, i lay beneath its shade. <line> <line>the night had seen me pace my lonely room, <line> <line>clasping the lyre i had no heart to wake, <line> <line>impatient for the day: yet its first dawn <line> <line>came cold as death; for every pulse sank down, <line> <line>until the very presence of my hope <line> <line>became to me a fear. the sun rose up; <line> <line>i stood alone 'mid thousands: but i felt <line> <line>mine inspiration; and, as the last sweep <line> <line>of my song died away amid the hills, <line> <line>my heart reverb'rated the shout which bore <line> <line>to the blue mountains and the distant heavenerinna's name, and on my bended knee, <line> <line>olympus, i received thy laurel crown. <line> <line> <line> <line> and twice new birth of violets have sprung, <line> <line>since they were first my pillow, since i sought <line> <line>in the deep silence of the olive grove <line> <line>the dreamy happiness which solitude <line> <line>brings to the soul o'erfill'd with its delight: <line> <line>for i was like some young and sudden heir <line> <line>of a rich palace heap'd with gems and gold, <line> <line>whose pleasure doubles as he sums his wealth <line> <line>and forms a thousand plans of festival; <line> <line>such were my myriad visions of delight. <line> <line>the lute, which hitherto in delphian shades <line> <line>had been my twilight's solitary joy, <line> <line>would henceforth be a sweet and breathing bond <line> <line>between me and my kind. orphan unloved, <line> <line>i had been lonely from my childhood's hour, <line> <line>childhood whose very happiness is love: <line> <line>but that was over now; my lyre would be <line> <line>my own heart's true interpreter, and those <line> <line>to whom my song was dear, would they not bless <line> <line>the hand that waken'd it? i should be loved <line> <line>for the so gentle sake of those soft chords <line> <line>which mingled others' feelings with mine own. <line> <line> <line> <line> vow'd i that song to meek and gentle thoughts, <line> <line>to tales that told of sorrow and of love, <line> <line>to all our nature's finest touches, all <line> <line>that wakens sympathy: and i should be <line> <line>alone no longer; every wind that bore, <line> <line>and every lip that breathed one strain of mine, <line> <line>henceforth partake in all my joy and grief. <line> <line>oh! glorious is the gifted poet's lot, <line> <line>and touching more than glorious: 'tis to be <line> <line>companion of the heart's least earthly hour; <line> <line>the voice of love and sadness, calling forth <line> <line>tears from their silent fountain: 'tis to have <line> <line>share in all nature's loveliness; giving flowers <line> <line>a life as sweet, more lasting than their own; <line> <line>and catching from green wood and lofty pine <line> <line>language mysterious as musical; <line> <line>making the thoughts, which else had only been <line> <line>like colours on the morning's earliest hour, <line> <line>immortal, and worth immortality; <line> <line>yielding the hero that eternal name <line> <line>for which he fought; making the patriot's deed <line> <line>a stirring record for long after-time; <line> <line>cherishing tender thoughts, which else had pass'd <line> <line>away like tears; and saving the loved dead <line> <line>from death's worst part — its deep forgetfulness. <line> <line> <line> <line>from the first moment when a falling leaf, <line> <line>or opening bud, or streak of rose-touch'd sky, <line> <line>waken'd in me the flush and flow of song, <line> <line>i gave my soul entire unto the gift <line> <line>i deem'd mine own, direct from heaven; it was <line> <line>the hope, the bliss, the energy of life; <line> <line>i had no hope that dwelt not with my lyre, <line> <line>no bliss whose being grew not from my lyre, <line> <line>no energy undevoted to my lyre. <line> <line>it was my other self that had a power; <line> <line>mine, but o'er which i had not a control. <line> <line>at times it was not with me, and i felt <line> <line>a wonder how it ever had been mine: <line> <line>and then a word, a look of loveliness, <line> <line>a tone of music, call'd it into life; <line> <line>a song came gushing, like the natural tears, <line> <line>to check whose current does not rest with us. <line> <line> <line> <line> had i lived ever in the savage woods, <line> <line>or in some distant island, which the sea <line> <line>with wind and wave guards in deep loneliness; <line> <line>had my eye never on the beauty dwelt <line> <line>of human face, and my ear never drank <line> <line>the music of a human voice; i feel <line> <line>my spirit would have pour'd itself in song, <line> <line>have learn'd a language from the rustling leaves, <line> <line>the singing of the birds, and of the tide. <line> <line>perchance, then, happy had i never known <line> <line>another thought could be attach'd to song <line> <line>than of its own delight. oh! let me pause <line> <line>over this earlier period, when my heart <line> <line>mingled its being with its pleasures, fill'd <line> <line>with rich enthusiasm, which once flung <line> <line>its purple colouring o'er all things of earth, <line> <line>and without which our utmost power of thought <line> <line>but sharpens arrows that will drink our blood. <line> <line>like woman's soothing influence o'er man <line> <line>enthusiasm is upon the mind; <line> <line>softening and beautifying that which is <line> <line>too harsh and sullen in itself. how much <line> <line>i loved the painter's glorious art, which forms <line> <line>a world like, but more beautiful than, this; <line> <line>just catching nature in her happiest mood! <line> <line>how drank i in fine poetry, which makes <line> <line>the hearing passionate, fill'd with memories <line> <line>which steal from out the past like rays from clouds! <line> <line>and then the sweet songs of my native vale, <line> <line>whose sweetness and whose softness call'd to mind <line> <line>the perfume of the flowers, the purity <line> <line>of the blue sky; oh, how they stirr'd my soul! — <line> <line>amid the many golden gifts which heaven <line> <line>has left, like portions of its light, on earth <line> <line>none hath such influence as music hath. <line> <line>the painter's hues stand visible before us <line> <line>in power and beauty; we can trace the thoughts <line> <line>which are the workings of the poet's mind: <line> <line>but music is a mystery, and viewless <line> <line>even when present, and is less man's act, <line> <line>and less within his order; for the hand <line> <line>that can call forth the tones, yet cannot tell <line> <line>whither they go, or if they live or die, <line> <line>when floated once beyond his feeble ear; <line> <line>and then, as if it were an unreal thing, <line> <line>the wind will sweep from the neglected strings <line> <line>as rich a swell as ever minstrel drew. <line> <line> <line> <line> a poet's word, a painter's touch, will reach <line> <line>the innermost recesses of the heart, <line> <line>making the pulses throb in unison <line> <line>with joy or grief, which we can analyse; <line> <line>there is the cause for pleasure and for pain: <line> <line>but music moves us, and we know not why; <line> <line>we feel the tears, but cannot trace their source. <line> <line>is it the language of some other state, <line> <line>born of its memory? for what can wake <line> <line>the soul's strong instinct of another world, <line> <line>like music? well with sadness doth it suit <line> <line>to hear the melancholy sounds decay, <line> <line>and think (for thoughts are life's great human links, <line> <line>and mingle with our feelings) even so <line> <line>will the heart's wildest pulses sink to rest. <line> <line> <line> <line> how have i loved, when the red evening fill'd <line> <line>our temple with its glory, first, to gaze <line> <line>on the strange contrast of the crimson air, <line> <line>lighted as if with passion, and flung back, <line> <line>from silver vase and tripod rich with gems, <line> <line>to the pale statues round, where human life <line> <line>was not, but beauty was, which seem'd to have <line> <line>apart existence from humanity: <line> <line>then, to go forth where the tall waving pines <line> <line>seem'd as behind them roll'd a golden sea <line> <line>immortal and eternal; and the boughs, <line> <line>that darkly swept between me and its light, <line> <line>were fitting emblems of the worldly cares <line> <line>that are the boundary between us and heaven; <line> <line>meanwhile, the wind, a wilful messenger <line> <line>lingering amid the flowers on his way, <line> <line>at intervals swept past in melody, <line> <line>the lutes and voices of the choral hymn <line> <line>contending with the rose-breath on his wing! <line> <line>perhaps it is these pleasures' chiefest charm, <line> <line>they are so indefinable, so vague. <line> <line>from earliest childhood all too well aware <line> <line>of the uncertain nature of our joys, <line> <line>it is delicious to enjoy, yet know <line> <line>no after-consequence will be to weep. <line> <line>pride misers with enjoyment, when we have <line> <line>delight in things that are but of the mind: <line> <line>but half humility when we partake <line> <line>pleasures that are half wants, the spirit pines <line> <line>and struggles in its fetters, and disdains <line> <line>the low base clay to which it is allied. <line> <line>but here our rapture raises us: we feel <line> <line>what glorious power is given to man, and find <line> <line>our nature's nobleness and attributes, <line> <line>whose heaven is intellect; and we are proud <line> <line>to think how we can love those things of earth <line> <line>which are least earthly; and the soul grows pure <line> <line>in this high communing, and more divine. <line> <line> <line> <line> this time of dreaming happiness pass'd by, <line> <line>another spirit was within my heart; <line> <line>i drank the maddening cup of praise, which grew <line> <line>henceforth the fountain of my life; i lived <line> <line>only in others' breath; a word, a look, <line> <line>were of all influence on my destiny: <line> <line>if praise they spoke, 'twas sunlight to my soul; <line> <line>or censure, it was like the scorpion's sting. <line> <line> <line> <line>and yet a darker lesson was to learn — <line> <line>the hollowness of each: that praise, which is <line> <line>but base exchange of flattery; that blame, <line> <line>given by cautious coldness, which still deems <line> <line>'tis safest to depress; that mockery, <line> <line>flinging shafts but to show its own keen aim; <line> <line>that carelessness, whose very censure's chance; <line> <line>and, worst of all, the earthly judgment pass'd <line> <line>by minds whose native clay is unredeem'd <line> <line>by aught of heaven, whose every thought falls foul <line> <line>plague-spot on beauty which they cannot feel, <line> <line>tainting all that it touches with itself. <line> <line>o dream of fame, what hast thou been to me <line> <line>but the destroyer of life's calm content! <line> <line>i feel so more than ever, that thy sway <line> <line>is weaken'd over me. once i could find <line> <line>a deep and dangerous delight in thee; <line> <line>but that is gone. i am too much awake. <line> <line>light has burst o'er me, but not morning's light; <line> <line>'tis such light as will burst upon the tomb, <line> <line>when all but judgment's over. can it be, <line> <line>that these fine impulses, these lofty thoughts, <line> <line>burning with their own beauty, are but given <line> <line>to make me the low slave of vanity, <line> <line>heartless and humbled? o my own sweet power, <line> <line>surely thy songs are made for more than this! <line> <line>what a worst waste of feeling and of life <line> <line>have been the imprints of my roll of time, <line> <line>too much, too long! to what use have i turn'd <line> <line>the golden gifts in which i pride myself? <line> <line>they are profaned; with their pure ore i made <line> <line>a temple resting only on the breath <line> <line>of heedless worshippers. alas! that ever <line> <line>praise should have been what it has been to me — <line> <line>the opiate of my heart. yet i have dream'd <line> <line>of things which cannot be; the bright, the pure, <line> <line>that all of which the heart may only dream; <line> <line>and i have mused upon my gift of song, <line> <line>and deeply felt its beauty, and disdain'd <line> <line>the pettiness of praise to which at times <line> <line>my soul has bow'd; and i have scorn'd myself <line> <line>for that my cheek could burn, my pulses beat <line> <line>at idle words. and yet it is in vain <line> <line>for the full heart to press back every throb <line> <line>wholly upon itself. ay, fair as are <line> <line>the visions of a poet's solitude, <line> <line>there must be something more for happiness; <line> <line>they seek communion. it had seem'd to me <line> <line>a miser's selfishness, had i not sought <line> <line>to share with others those impassion'd thoughts, <line> <line>like light, or hope, or love, in their effects. <line> <line>when i have watch'd the stars write on the sky <line> <line>in characters of light, have seen the moon <line> <line>come like veiled priestess from the east, <line> <line>while, like a hymn, the wind swell'd on mine ear, <line> <line>telling soft tidings of eve's thousand flowers, <line> <line>has it not been the transport of my lute <line> <line>to find its best delight in sympathy? <line> <line>alas! the idols which our hopes set up, <line> <line>they are chaldean ones, half gold, half clay; <line> <line>we trust we are deceived, we hope, we fear, <line> <line>alike without foundation; day by day <line> <line>some new illusion is destroyed, and life <line> <line>gets cold and colder on towards its close. <line> <line>just like the years which make it, some are check'd <line> <line>by sudden blights in spring; some are dried up <line> <line>by fiery summers; others waste away <line> <line>in calm monotony of quiet skies, <line> <line>and peradventure these may be the best: <line> <line>they know no hurricanes, no floods that sweep <line> <line>as a god's vengeance were upon each wave; <line> <line>but then they have no ruby fruits, no flowers <line> <line>shining in purple, and no lighted mines <line> <line>of gold and diamond. which is the best, — <line> <line>beauty and glory, in a southern clime, <line> <line>mingled with thunder, tempest; or the calm <line> <line>of skies that scarcely change, which, at the least, <line> <line>if much of shine they have not, have no storms? <line> <line>i know not: but i know fair earth or sky <line> <line>are self-consuming in their loveliness, <line> <line>and the too radiant sun and fertile soil <line> <line>in their luxuriance run themselves to waste, <line> <line>and the green valley and the silver stream <line> <line>become a sandy desert. o! the mind, <line> <line>too vivid in its lighted energies, <line> <line>may read its fate in sunny araby. <line> <line>how lives its beauty in each eastern tale, <line> <line>its growth of spices, and its groves of balm! <line> <line>they are exhausted; and what is it now? <line> <line>a wild and burning wilderness. alas! <line> <line>for such similitude. too much this is <line> <line>the fate of this world's loveliest and best. <line> <line> <line> <line> is there not a far people, who possess <line> <line>mysterious oracles of olden time, <line> <line>who say that this earth labours with a curse, <line> <line>that it is fallen from its first estate, <line> <line>and is now but the shade of what it was? <line> <line>i do believe the tale. i feel its truth <line> <line>in my vain aspirations, in the dreams <line> <line>that are revealings of another world, <line> <line>more pure, more perfect than our weary one, <line> <line>where day is darkness to the starry soul. <line> <line> <line> <line> o heart of mine! my once sweet paradise <line> <line>of love and hope! how changed thou art to me! <line> <line>i cannot count thy changes: thou hast lost <line> <line>interest in the once idols of thy being; <line> <line>they have departed, even as if wings <line> <line>had borne away their morning; they have left <line> <line>weariness, turning pleasure into pain, <line> <line>and too sure knowledge of their hollowness. <line> <line> <line> <line> and that too is gone from me; that which was <line> <line>my solitude's delight! i can no more <line> <line>make real existence of a shadowy world. <line> <line>time was, the poet's song, the ancient tale, <line> <line>were to me fountains of deep happiness, <line> <line>for they grew visible in my lonely hours, <line> <line>as things in which i had a deed and part; <line> <line>their actual presence had not been more true: <line> <line>but these are bubbling sparkles, that are found <line> <line>but at the spring's first source. ah! years may bring <line> <line>the mind to its perfection, but no more <line> <line>will those young visions live in their own light; <line> <line>life's troubles stir life's waters all too much, <line> <line>passions chase fancies, and though still we dream, <line> <line>the colouring is from reality. <line> <line> <line> <line> farewell, my lyre! thou hast not been to me <line> <line>all i once hoped. what is the gift of mind, <line> <line>but as a barrier to so much that makes <line> <line>our life endurable, — companionship, <line> <line>mingling affection, calm and gentle peace, <line> <line>till the vex'd spirit seals with discontent <line> <line>a league of sorrow and of vanity, <line> <line>built on a future which will never be! <line> <line> <line> <line> and yet i would resign the praise that now <line> <line>makes my cheek crimson, and my pulses beat, <line> <line>could i but deem that when my hand is cold, <line> <line>and my lip passionless, my songs would be <line> <line>number'd mid the young poet's first delights; <line> <line>read by the dark-eyed maiden in an hour <line> <line>of moonlight, till her cheek shone with its tears; <line> <line>and murmur'd by the lover when his suit <line> <line>calls upon poetry to breathe of love. <line> <line>i do not hope a sunshine burst of fame, <line> <line>my lyre asks but a wreath of fragile flowers. <line> <line>i have told passionate tales of breaking hearts, <line> <line>of young cheeks fading even before the rose; <line> <line>my songs have been the mournful history <line> <line>of woman's tenderness and woman's tears; <line> <line>i have touch'd but the spirit's gentlest chords, — <line> <line>surely the fittest for my maiden hand; — <line> <line>and in their truth my immortality. <line> <line> <line> <line> thou lovely and lone star, whose silver light, <line> <line>like music o'er the waters, steals along <line> <line>the soften'd atmosphere; pale star, to thee <line> <line>i dedicate the lyre, whose influence <line> <line>i would have sink upon the heart like thine. <line> <line> <line> <line> in such an hour as this, the bosom turns <line> <line>back to its early feelings;

and if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead? and if the body does not do fully as much as the soul? and if the body were not the soul, what is the soul? 2 the love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body itself balks account, that of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect. the expression of the face balks account, but the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face, it is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists, it is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees, dress does not hide him, the strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth, to see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more, you linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side. the sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards, the swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the water, the bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the horseman in his saddle, girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances, the group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting, the female soothing a child, the farmer’s daughter in the garden or cow-yard, the young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six horses through the crowd, the wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sun-down after work, the coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance, the upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes; the march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps, the slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the alert, the natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv’d neck and the counting; such-like i love—i loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother’s breast with the little child, swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, count. 3 i knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons, and in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons. this man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person, the shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness and breadth of his manners, these i used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also, he was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome, they and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him, they did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love, he drank water only, the blood show’d like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face, he was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail’d his boat himself, he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him, when he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang, you would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other. 4 i have perceiv’d that to be with those i like is enough, to stop in company with the rest at evening is enough, to be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough, to pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then? i do not ask any more delight, i swim in it as in a sea. there is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well, all things please the soul, but these please the soul well. 5 this is the female form, a divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot, it attracts with fierce undeniable attraction, i am drawn by its breath as if i were no more than a helpless vapor, all falls aside but myself and it, books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what was expected of heaven or fear’d of hell, are now consumed, mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response likewise ungovernable, hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all diffused, mine too diffused, ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching, limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice, bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn, undulating into the willing and yielding day, lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh’d day. this the nucleus—after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman, this the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the outlet again. be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest, you are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul. the female contains all qualities and tempers them, she is in her place and moves with perfect balance, she is all things duly veil’d, she is both passive and active, she is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters. as i see my soul reflected in nature, as i see through a mist, one with inexpressible completeness, sanity, beauty, see the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the female i see. 6 the male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place, he too is all qualities, he is action and power, the flush of the known universe is in him, scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well, the wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost become him well, pride is for him, the full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul, knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to the test of himself, whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes soundings at last only here, (where else does he strike soundings except here?) the man’s body is sacred and the woman’s body is sacred, no matter who it is, it is sacred—is it the meanest one in the laborers’ gang?

<line>between the great and the rest of <line> <line>us, who serve them: — <line> <line> <line> <line>a knife; and art. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>the emblem of florence is the lion; therefore <line> <line>lions, caged but restless and living, centuries ago <line> <line> <line> <line>began to announce to the piazza della signoria <line> <line> <line> <line>this is the fearsome seat of the free <line> <line>government of the republic of florence. <line> <line> <line> <line>duke cosimo, hating the noise and smell, had them <line> <line> <line> <line>moved behind the palace. for years, i had known <line> <line>the old man who fed and tended the lions, — <line> <line> <line> <line>one day he humbly asked me if i could make a ring <line> <line> <line> <line>unlike all others for his daughter’s wedding. <line> <line>i said yes, of course; but, as payment for its <line> <line> <line> <line>rarity, i wanted him to drug the strongest lion <line> <line> <line> <line>asleep, so that i could <line> <line>examine, for my art, his body. <line> <line> <line> <line>he said he knew no art of drugging; such poison <line> <line> <line> <line>could kill the creature; a week later, <line> <line>in fury he said yes. <line> <line> <line> <line>the animal was numbed but not <line> <line> <line> <line>sleeping; he tried to raise <line> <line>his great head, as i lay lengthwise against his warm body; <line> <line> <line> <line>the head fell back. my head <line> <line> <line> <line>nestling behind his, each arm, outstretched, slowly <line> <line>descending along each leg, at last with both hands i <line> <line> <line> <line>pulled back the fur and touched a claw. <line> <line> <line> <line>this creature whose claw waking could kill me, — <line> <line>. . . i wore its skin. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>after the medici were returned from eighteen years’ <line> <line>banishment, placed over us again not by the will <line> <line> <line> <line>of florentines, but by a spanish army — <line> <line> <line> <line>my father, though during the republic he regained <line> <line>his position as piper, ever loyal to the medici <line> <line> <line> <line>wrote a poem celebrating his party’s victory <line> <line> <line> <line>and prophesying the imminent <line> <line>advent of a medici pope. then julius ii died; <line> <line> <line> <line>cardinal de’ medici, against expectation, was elected; <line> <line> <line> <line>the new pope wrote my father that he must <line> <line>come to rome and serve him. <line> <line> <line> <line>my father had no will to travel. then jacopo <line> <line> <line> <line>salviati, in power because married to a medici, <line> <line>took from my father his place at the duke’s new court; <line> <line> <line> <line>took from him his profit, his hope, his will. <line> <line> <line> <line>thus began that slow extinguishment <line> <line>of hope, the self ’s obsequies for the self <line> <line> <line> <line>at which effacement i felt not only a helpless <line> <line> <line> <line>witness, but <line> <line>cause, author. <line> <line> <line> <line>he said i was his heart. <line> <line> i had asked to be his heartbefore i knew what i was asking. <line> <line> <line> <line>against his mania to make me a musician <line> <line> <line> <line>at fifteen i put myself to the goldsmith’s trade; <line> <line>without money <line> <line> <line> <line>or position, he now could not oppose this. <line> <line> help the boy — for his father is poor <line> <line>rang in my ears as i began to sell <line> <line> <line> <line>the first trinkets i had made. later, to escape <line> <line> <line> <line>the plague then raging, he made me <line> <line>quickly leave florence; when i returned, <line> <line> <line> <line>he, my sister, her husband and child, were dead. <line> <line> <line> <line>these events, many occurring before my birth, i <line> <line>see because my father described them <line> <line> <line> <line>often and with outrage. <line> <line> <line> <line>to be a child is to see things and not <line> <line>know them; then you know them. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>despite the malicious <line> <line>stars, decisive at my birth: despite their <line> <line> <line> <line>sufficient instrument, the hand within me that moves against me: in the utter darkness of my first prison <line> <line>god granted me vision: <line> <line> <line> <line>surrounded by my stinks, an angel, his beauty <line> <line> <line> <line>austere, not wanton, graciously <line> <line>showed me a room in half-light crowded with the dead: <line> <line> <line> <line>postures blunted as if all promise of change <line> <line> <line> <line>was lost, the dead <line> <line>walked up and down and back and forth: <line> <line> <line> <line>as if the promise of change <line> <line> <line> <line>fleeing had stolen the light. <line> <line>then, on the wall, there was a square of light. <line> <line> <line> <line>careless of blindness i turned my eyes <line> <line> <line> <line>to the full sun. i did not care <line> <line>to look on anything again but this. the sun <line> <line> <line> <line>withering and quickening without distinction <line> <line> <line> <line>then bulged out: the boss <line> <line>expanded: the calm body of the dead christ <line> <line> <line> <line>formed itself from the same <line> <line> <line> <line>substance as the sun. still on the cross, <line> <line>he was the same substance as the sun. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>the bait the duke laid <line> <line>was perseus. perseus <line> <line> <line> <line>standing before the piazza della signoria. <line> <line> <line> <line>my statue’s audience and theater, michelangelo’sdavid; donatello’s <line> <line> judith with the head of holofernes . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>here the school of florence, swaggering, says <line> <line>to the world: eat. <line> <line> <line> <line>only bandinelli’s odious hercules and cacus <line> <line> <line> <line>reminds one that when one walks <line> <line>streets on earth one steps in shit. <line> <line> <line> <line>duke cosimo desired, he said, a statue of perseus <line> <line> <line> <line>triumphant, after intricate trials able <line> <line>at last to raise high <line> <line> <line> <line>medusa’s mutilated head — he imagined, <line> <line> <line> <line>perhaps, decapitation of the fickle <line> <line>rabble of republican florence . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>i conceived the hero’s gesture as more generous: — <line> <line> kill the thing that lookedupon makes us stone. <line> <line> <line> <line>soon enough, on my great bronze bust of the great <line> <line> <line> <line>duke, i placed — staring out from his chest — <line> <line>medusa, her head not yet cut, living. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> remember, benvenuto, you cannot bring yourgreat gifts to light by your strength alone you show your greatness only through the opportunities we give youhold your tongue i will drown you in gold <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>as we stared down at the vast square, atdavid, at judith — then at hercules and cacus <line> <line> <line> <line>approved and placed there by cosimo himself — <line> <line> <line> <line>from high on the fortress lookout of the palace, <line> <line>against whose severe façade so many <line> <line> <line> <line>human promises had been so cunningly <line> <line> <line> <line>or indifferently crushed, i told the duke that i <line> <line>cannot make his statue. my brief return from france <line> <line> <line> <line>was designed only to provide for the future of <line> <line> <line> <line>my sister and six nieces, now without husband <line> <line>or father. the king of france alone had saved me <line> <line> <line> <line>from the pope’s dungeon — not any lord of italy! <line> <line> <line> <line>at this, the duke looked at me <line> <line>sharply, but said nothing. <line> <line> <line> <line>all rome knew that though i had disproved <line> <line> <line> <line>the theft that was pretext for my arrest, pope paul <line> <line>still kept me imprisoned, out of spite — <line> <line> <line> <line>vengeance of his malignant son pier luigi, now <line> <line> <line> <line>assassinated by his own retainers. <line> <line>one night at dinner, the king’s emissary gave the pope <line> <line> <line> <line>gossip so delicious that out of merriment, and about to vomit <line> <line> <line> <line>from indulgence, he agreed <line> <line>to free me. i owed king francis <line> <line> <line> <line>my art, my service. the same stipend he once paid <line> <line> <line> <line>leonardo, he now paid me; along with a house in paris. <line> <line>this house was, in truth, a castle . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>i omitted, of course, quarrels with the king’s <line> <line> <line> <line>mistress, demon who taunted me for the slowness <line> <line>of my work, out of her petty hatred of art itself; <line> <line> <line> <line>omitted her insistence to the king that i <line> <line> <line> <line>am insolent and by example teach <line> <line>insolence to others. omitted that i overheard the king <line> <line> <line> <line>joke with her lieutenant: — <line> <line> kill him, if you can find mehis equal in art. <line> <line> <line> <line>before the school of florence i had only been able, <line> <line> <line> <line>young, to show myself as goldsmith <line> <line>and jeweler; not yet as sculptor. <line> <line> <line> <line>duke cosimo then announced that all the king of france <line> <line> <line> <line>had given me, he would surpass: boasting, <line> <line>he beckoned me to follow him past the public <line> <line> <line> <line>common galleries, into the private apartments . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>dutiful abashed puppet, i followed; i knew <line> <line>i would remain and make his statue. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> in the mirror of art, you who are familiar with the rituals ofdecorum and bloodshed before which you are silence and submission while within stonethe mind writhes <line> <line> contemplate, as if a refrain were wisdom, the glistening intricationof bronze and will and circumstance in the mirror of art. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>bandinelli for months insinuated in the duke’s ear <line> <line>perseus never would be finished: — <line> <line> <line> <line>i lacked the art, he said, to move from the small <line> <line> <line> <line>wax model the duke rightly praised, to lifesize <line> <line>bronze whose secrets tormented even donatello. <line> <line> <line> <line>so eighteen months after work began, duke cosimo grew <line> <line> <line> <line>tired, and withdrew his subsidy. lattanzo gorini, <line> <line>spider-handed and gnat-voiced, refusing to hand over <line> <line> <line> <line>payment said, why do you not finish? <line> <line> <line> <line>then bandinelli hissed sodomite! at <line> <line>me — after my enumeration, to the court’s <line> <line> <line> <line>amusement, of the sins against art and sense <line> <line> <line> <line>committed by his hercules and cacus, recital <line> <line>designed to kill either him or his authority . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>the duke, at the ugly word, frowned <line> <line> <line> <line>and turned away. i replied that the sculptor ofhercules and cacus must be a madman to think that i <line> <line> <line> <line>presumed to understand the art that jove in heaven <line> <line> <line> <line>used on ganymede, art nobly practiced here on earth <line> <line>by so many emperors and kings. my saucy speech <line> <line> <line> <line>ended: my poor wick does not dare to burn so high! <line> <line> <line> <line>duke and court broke into laughter. thus was <line> <line>born my resolve to murder bandinelli. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>i’d hurl the creature to hell. in despair at what must <line> <line>follow — the duke’s rage, abandonment of my <line> <line> <line> <line>never-to-be-born perseus — i cast <line> <line> <line> <line>myself away for lost: with a hundred crowns <line> <line>and a swift horse, i resolved first to bid <line> <line> <line> <line>farewell to my natural son, put to wet-nurse in fiesole; <line> <line> <line> <line>then to descend to san domenico, where bandinelli <line> <line>returned each evening. then, after blood, france. <line> <line> <line> <line>reaching fiesole, i saw the boy <line> <line> <line> <line>was in good health; his wet-nurse <line> <line>was my old familiar, old gossip, now <line> <line> <line> <line>married to one of my workmen. the boy <line> <line> <line> <line>clung to me: wonderful in a two-year-old, in <line> <line>grief he flailed his arms when at last <line> <line> <line> <line>in the thick half-dusk <line> <line> <line> <line>i began to disengage myself. entering the square <line> <line>of san domenico on one side, i saw my prey <line> <line> <line> <line>arriving on the other. enraged that he still <line> <line> <line> <line>drew breath, when i reached him <line> <line>i saw he was unarmed. he rode a small sorry <line> <line> <line> <line>mule. a wheezing donkey carried a ten-year-old <line> <line> <line> <line>boy at his side. in my sudden presence, his face <line> <line>went white. i nodded my head and rode past. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>i had a vision of bandinelli surrounded <line> <line>by the heaped-up works of his hand. <line> <line> not one thing that he had made did i want to have made. <line> <line>from somewhere within his body <line> <line> <line> <line>like a thread <line> <line> <line> <line>he spun the piles surrounding him. then he <line> <line>tried to pull away, to release the thread; i saw <line> <line> <line> <line>the thread was a leash. <line> <line> <line> <line>he tried and tried to cut it. <line> <line>at this, in my vision i said out-loud: — <line> <line> my art is my revenge. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>when i returned to florence from fiesole, after <line> <line>three days news was brought to me that my little boy <line> <line> <line> <line>was smothered by his wet-nurse <line> <line> <line> <line>turning over on him as they both slept. <line> <line>his panic, as i left; his arms raised, in panic. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> from the great unchosen narration you will soonbe released benvenuto cellini dirtied by blood and earthbut now <line> <line> you have again taught yourself to disappear moving wax from armto thigh you have again taught yourself to disappear here where each soul is itsorbit spinning sweetly around the center of itself at the edge of its eye the greatdesign of virtue here your medusa and your perseus are twins his triumphant body still furious with purposebut his face abstracted absorbed in contemplation as she is abstracted absorbedthough blood still spurts from her neck <line> <line> defeated by a mirror as in concentration you move waxfrom thigh to arm under your hand it grows <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>the idyll began when the duke reached me a goldsmith’s <line> <line>hammer, with which i struck the goldsmith’s <line> <line> <line> <line>chisel he held; and so the little statues were <line> <line> <line> <line>disengaged from earth and rust. bronze <line> <line>antiquities, newly found near arezzo, they lacked <line> <line> <line> <line>either head or hands or feet. impatient for my <line> <line> <line> <line>presence, the duke insisted that i join him each evening <line> <line>at his new pastime, playing artisan — leaving orders <line> <line> <line> <line>for my free admittance to his rooms, day or night. <line> <line> <line> <line>his four boys, when the duke’s eyes were turned, <line> <line>hovered around me, teasing. one night <line> <line> <line> <line>i begged them to hold their peace. <line> <line> <line> <line>the boldest replied, that we can’t do! i said <line> <line>what one cannot do is required of no one. <line> <line> so have your will! faced with their sons’ <line> <line> <line> <line>delight in this new principle, the duke and duchess <line> <line>smiling accused me of a taste for chaos . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>at last the four figures wrought for the four <line> <line> <line> <line>facets of the pedestal beneath perseus <line> <line>were finished. i brought them one evening to the duke, <line> <line> <line> <line>arranging them on his worktable in a row: — <line> <line> figures, postures from scenes that the eye cannotentirely decipher, story haunting the eye with its <line> <line> resonance, unseen ground that explains nothing . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>the duke appeared, then immediately <line> <line>retreated; reappearing, in his right hand <line> <line> <line> <line>he held a pear slip. this is for your garden, the garden of your house. i began, do you mean, but he cut me off <line> <line>saying, yes, benvenuto: garden and house now are yours. <line> <line> <line> <line>thus i received what earlier was only lent me. <line> <line> <line> <line>i thanked him and his duchess; then both <line> <line>took seats before my figures. <line> <line> <line> <line>for two hours talk was of their beauty, — <line> <line> <line> <line>the duchess insisted they were too exquisite <line> <line>to be wasted down there <line> <line> <line> <line>in the piazza; i must place them in her apartments. <line> <line> <line> <line>no argument from intention or design <line> <line>unconvinced her. <line> <line> <line> <line>so i waited till the next day — entering the private <line> <line> <line> <line>chambers at the hour the duke and duchess <line> <line>each afternoon went riding, i carried the statues <line> <line> <line> <line>down and soldered them with lead into their niches. <line> <line> <line> <line>returning, how angry the duchess became! the duke <line> <line>abandoned his workshop. i went there no more. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>the old inertia of earth that hates the new <line> <line>(as from a rim i watched) <line> <line> <line> <line>rose from the ground, legion: — <line> <line> <line> <line>truceless ministers of the great unerasable <line> <line>zero, eager to annihilate lineament and light, <line> <line> <line> <line>waited, pent, against the horizon: — <line> <line> <line> <line>some great force (massive, stubborn, multiform asearth, fury whose single name is legion, — ) <line> <line> <line> <line>wanted my perseus not to exist: — <line> <line> <line> <line>and i must <line> <line>defeat them. <line> <line> <line> <line>then my trembling assistants woke me. <line> <line> <line> <line>they said all my work <line> <line>was spoiled. <line> <line> <line> <line>perseus was spoiled. he lay buried in earth <line> <line> <line> <line>wreathed in fragile earthenware veins from the furnace <line> <line>above, veins through which he still <line> <line> <line> <line>waited to be filled with burning metal. <line> <line> <line> <line>the metal was curdled. as i slept, sick, <line> <line>the bronze had been allowed to cake, to curdle. <line> <line> <line> <line>feverish, made sick by my exertions for <line> <line> <line> <line>days, for months, i slept; while those charged <line> <line>with evenly feeding the furnace that i had so well <line> <line> <line> <line>prepared, larked — <line> <line> <line> <line>i thought, unwitting ministers of the gorgonmedusa herself. the furnace choked with caking, curdling <line> <line> <line> <line>metal that no art known to man could <line> <line> <line> <line>uncurdle, must be utterly dismantled — all <line> <line>who made it agreed this must destroy <line> <line> <line> <line>the fragile, thirsty mould of perseus beneath. <line> <line> <line> <line>but perseus was not more strong <line> <line>than medusa, but more clever: — if he ever <line> <line> <line> <line>was to exist as idea, he must first exist as matter: — <line> <line> <line> <line>all my old inborn <line> <line>daring returned, <line> <line> <line> <line>furious to reverse <line> <line> <line> <line>the unjust triumphs of the world’s mere <line> <line>arrangements of power, that seemingly on earth <line> <line> <line> <line>cannot be reversed. first, i surveyed my forces: — <line> <line> <line> <line>seven guilty workmen, timid, sullen, <line> <line>resentful; a groom; two maids; a cook. <line> <line> <line> <line>i harassed these skeptical troops into battle: — <line> <line> <line> <line>two hands were sent to fetch from the butcher <line> <line>capretta a load of young oak, — <line> <line> <line> <line>in bronze furnaces the only woods you use <line> <line> <line> <line>are slow-burning alder, willow, pine: now i needed <line> <line>oak and its fierce heat. as the oak <line> <line> <line> <line>was fed log by log into the fire, how the cake began <line> <line> <line> <line>to stir, to glow and sparkle. now <line> <line>from the increased <line> <line> <line> <line>combustion of the furnace, a conflagration <line> <line> <line> <line>shot up from the roof: two windows <line> <line>burst into flame: i saw the violent storm <line> <line> <line> <line>filling the sky fan the flames. <line> <line> <line> <line>all the while with pokers and iron rods <line> <line>we stirred and stirred the channels— <line> <line> <line> <line>the metal, bubbling, refused to flow. <line> <line> <line> <line>i sent for all my pewter plates, dishes, porringers — <line> <line>the cook and maids brought some two hundred. <line> <line> <line> <line>piece by piece, i had them thrown <line> <line> <line> <line>into the turgid mass. as i watched the metal for <line> <line>movement, the cap of the furnace <line> <line> <line> <line>exploded — bronze welling over on all sides. <line> <line> <line> <line>i had the plugs pulled, the mouths of the mould <line> <line>opened; in perfect liquefaction <line> <line> <line> <line>the veins of perseus filled . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>days later, when the bronze had cooled, when the clay <line> <line>sheath had been with great care removed, i found <line> <line> <line> <line>what was dead brought to life again. <line> <line> <line> <line> • <line> <line> <line> <line>now, my second <line> <line>prison. it began soon after perseus was unveiled <line> <line> <line> <line>to acclaim — great acclaim. perhaps i grew <line> <line> <line> <line>too glorious. perseus, whose birth consumed <line> <line>nine years, found stuck to his pedestal <line> <line> <line> <line>sonnets celebrating the master’s hand that made him . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>on the day of unveiling, duke cosimo stationed himself <line> <line>at a window just above the entrance to the palace; <line> <line> <line> <line>there, half-hidden, he listened for hours to the crowd’s <line> <line> <line> <line>wonder. he sent his attendant sforza to say <line> <line>my reward <line> <line> <line> <line>soon would astonish me. <line> <line> <line> <line>ten days passed. at last sforza appeared and asked <line> <line>what price i placed on my statue. <line> <line> <line> <line>i was indeed astonished: it is not my custom, <line> <line> <line> <line>i replied, to set a price for my work, as ifhe were a merchant and i a mere tradesman. <line> <line> <line> <line>then, at risk of the duke’s severe displeasure, i was <line> <line> <line> <line>warned i must set a price: infuriated, i said <line> <line>ten thousand golden crowns. <line> <line> cities and great palaces are built with ten thousand golden crowns, the duke <line> <line>two days later flung at me in anger. <line> <line> many men can build cities and palaces, <line> <line> <line> <line>i replied, but not one can makea second perseus. <line> <line> <line> <line>bandinelli, consulted by the duke, reluctantly <line> <line> <line> <line>concluded that the statue was worth <line> <line>sixteen thousand. <line> <line> <line> <line>the duke replied that for two farthings <line> <line> <line> <line>perseus could go to the scrap heap; that would <line> <line>resolve our differences. <line> <line> <line> <line>at last, the settlement was thirty-five hundred, one <line> <line> <line> <line>hundred a month. soon after, charges were brought <line> <line>against me, for sodomy — <line> <line> <line> <line>i escaped florence as far as scarperia, but there <line> <line> <line> <line>the duke’s soldiers caught me and in chains <line> <line>brought me back. <line> <line> <line> <line>i confessed. if i had not, i could have been made <line> <line> <line> <line>to serve as a slave in the duke’s galleys for life. <line> <line>the duke listened behind a screen as i was made <line> <line> <line> <line>publicly to confess, in full court . . . punishment <line> <line> <line> <line>was four years imprisonment. without the duke’s <line> <line>concurrence, of course, no charges could have been <line> <line> <line> <line>lodged, no public humiliation arranged <line> <line> <line> <line>to silence the insolent. the first cosimo, founder of medicipower, all his life protected donatello — whose affections and bliss were found in ganymede. <line> <line> <line> <line>after imprisonment one month, cosimo <line>

until her skin moved by itself <line> <line> <line> <line>downward from her navel and covered her bones. <line> <line> <line> <line>then i took some dry mud and put my sweat <line> <line>and her blood in the dry mud <line> <line> <line> <line>and warmed it over a fire. six or eight times <line> <line> <line> <line>i put the blood and sweat and mud <line> <line>inside her uterus until there was no

<line>she ate some lilies. she walked around, then <line> <line> <line> <line>came back and slept. when laughing and talking women <line> <line>woke her she gathered her lilies and returned to camp.

9688,7114,"<line> <line>st. agnes' eve—ah, bitter chill it was! the owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold; the hare limp'd trembling through the frozen grass, and silent was the flock in woolly fold: numb were the beadsman's fingers, while he told his rosary, and while his frosted breath, like pious incense from a censer old, seem'd taking flight for heaven, without a death, past the sweet virgin's picture, while his prayer he saith. his prayer he saith, this patient, holy man; then takes his lamp, and riseth from his knees, and back returneth, meagre, barefoot, wan, along the chapel aisle by slow degrees: the sculptur'd dead, on each side, seem to freeze, emprison'd in black, purgatorial rails: knights, ladies, praying in dumb orat'ries, he passeth by; and his weak spirit fails to think how they may ache in icy hoods and mails. northward he turneth through a little door, and scarce three steps, ere music's golden tongue flatter'd to tears this aged man and poor; but no—already had his deathbell rung; the joys of all his life were said and sung: his was harsh penance on st. agnes' eve: another way he went, and soon among rough ashes sat he for his soul's reprieve, and all night kept awake, for sinners' sake to grieve. that ancient beadsman heard the prelude soft; and so it chanc'd, for many a door was wide, from hurry to and fro. soon, up aloft, the silver, snarling trumpets 'gan to chide: the level chambers, ready with their pride, were glowing to receive a thousand guests: the carved angels, ever eager-eyed, star'd, where upon their heads the cornice rests, with hair blown back, and wings put cross-wise on their breasts. at length burst in the argent revelry, with plume, tiara, and all rich array, numerous as shadows haunting faerily the brain, new stuff'd, in youth, with triumphs gay of old romance. these let us wish away, and turn, sole-thoughted, to one lady there, whose heart had brooded, all that wintry day, on love, and wing'd st. agnes' saintly care, as she had heard old dames full many times declare. they told her how, upon st. agnes' eve, young virgins might have visions of delight, and soft adorings from their loves receive upon the honey'd middle of the night, if ceremonies due they did aright; as, supperless to bed they must retire, and couch supine their beauties, lily white; nor look behind, nor sideways, but require of heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire. full of this whim was thoughtful madeline: the music, yearning like a god in pain, she scarcely heard: her maiden eyes divine, fix'd on the floor, saw many a sweeping train pass by—she heeded not at all: in vain came many a tiptoe, amorous cavalier, and back retir'd; not cool'd by high disdain, but she saw not: her heart was otherwhere: she sigh'd for agnes' dreams, the sweetest of the year. she danc'd along with vague, regardless eyes, anxious her lips, her breathing quick and short: the hallow'd hour was near at hand: she sighs amid the timbrels, and the throng'd resort of whisperers in anger, or in sport; 'mid looks of love, defiance, hate, and scorn, hoodwink'd with faery fancy; all amort, save to st. agnes and her lambs unshorn, and all the bliss to be before to-morrow morn. so, purposing each moment to retire, she linger'd still. meantime, across the moors, had come young porphyro, with heart on fire for madeline. beside the portal doors, buttress'd from moonlight, stands he, and implores all saints to give him sight of madeline, but for one moment in the tedious hours, that he might gaze and worship all unseen; perchance speak, kneel, touch, kiss—in sooth such things have been. he ventures in: let no buzz'd whisper tell: all eyes be muffled, or a hundred swords will storm his heart, love's fev'rous citadel: for him, those chambers held barbarian hordes, hyena foemen, and hot-blooded lords, whose very dogs would execrations howl against his lineage: not one breast affords him any mercy, in that mansion foul, save one old beldame, weak in body and in soul. ah, happy chance! the aged creature came, shuffling along with ivory-headed wand, to where he stood, hid from the torch's flame, behind a broad half-pillar, far beyond the sound of merriment and chorus bland: he startled her; but soon she knew his face, and grasp'd his fingers in her palsied hand, saying, ""mercy, porphyro! hie thee from this place; they are all here to-night, the whole blood-thirsty race! ""get hence! get hence! there's dwarfish hildebrand; he had a fever late, and in the fit he cursed thee and thine, both house and land: then there's that old lord maurice, not a whit more tame for his gray hairs—alas me! flit! flit like a ghost away.""—""ah, gossip dear, we're safe enough; here in this arm-chair sit, and tell me how""—""good saints! not here, not here; follow me, child, or else these stones will be thy bier."" he follow'd through a lowly arched way, brushing the cobwebs with his lofty plume, and as she mutter'd ""well-a—well-a-day!"" he found him in a little moonlight room, pale, lattic'd, chill, and silent as a tomb. ""now tell me where is madeline,"" said he, ""o tell me, angela, by the holy loom which none but secret sisterhood may see, when they st. agnes' wool are weaving piously."" ""st. agnes! ah! it is st. agnes' eve— yet men will murder upon holy days: thou must hold water in a witch's sieve, and be liege-lord of all the elves and fays, to venture so: it fills me with amaze to see thee, porphyro!—st. agnes' eve! god's help! my lady fair the conjuror plays this very night: good angels her deceive! but let me laugh awhile, i've mickle time to grieve."" feebly she laugheth in the languid moon, while porphyro upon her face doth look, like puzzled urchin on an aged crone who keepeth clos'd a wond'rous riddle-book, as spectacled she sits in chimney nook. but soon his eyes grew brilliant, when she told his lady's purpose; and he scarce could brook tears, at the thought of those enchantments cold, and madeline asleep in lap of legends old. sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose, flushing his brow, and in his pained heart made purple riot: then doth he propose a stratagem, that makes the beldame start: ""a cruel man and impious thou art: sweet lady, let her pray, and sleep, and dream alone with her good angels, far apart from wicked men like thee. go, go!—i deem thou canst not surely be the same that thou didst seem."" ""i will not harm her, by all saints i swear,"" quoth porphyro: ""o may i ne'er find grace when my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer, if one of her soft ringlets i displace, or look with ruffian passion in her face: good angela, believe me by these tears; or i will, even in a moment's space, awake, with horrid shout, my foemen's ears, and beard them, though they be more fang'd than wolves and bears."" ""ah! why wilt thou affright a feeble soul? a poor, weak, palsy-stricken, churchyard thing, whose passing-bell may ere the midnight toll; whose prayers for thee, each morn and evening, were never miss'd.""—thus plaining, doth she bring a gentler speech from burning porphyro; so woful, and of such deep sorrowing, that angela gives promise she will do whatever he shall wish, betide her weal or woe. which was, to lead him, in close secrecy, even to madeline's chamber, and there hide him in a closet, of such privacy that he might see her beauty unespy'd, and win perhaps that night a peerless bride, while legion'd faeries pac'd the coverlet, and pale enchantment held her sleepy-ey'd. never on such a night have lovers met, since merlin paid his demon all the monstrous debt. ""it shall be as thou wishest,"" said the dame: ""all cates and dainties shall be stored there quickly on this feast-night: by the tambour frame her own lute thou wilt see: no time to spare, for i am slow and feeble, and scarce dare on such a catering trust my dizzy head. wait here, my child, with patience; kneel in prayer the while: ah! thou must needs the lady wed, or may i never leave my grave among the dead."" so saying, she hobbled off with busy fear. the lover's endless minutes slowly pass'd; the dame return'd, and whisper'd in his ear to follow her; with aged eyes aghast from fright of dim espial. safe at last, through many a dusky gallery, they gain the maiden's chamber, silken, hush'd, and chaste; where porphyro took covert, pleas'd amain. his poor guide hurried back with agues in her brain. her falt'ring hand upon the balustrade, old angela was feeling for the stair, when madeline, st. agnes' charmed maid, rose, like a mission'd spirit, unaware: with silver taper's light, and pious care, she turn'd, and down the aged gossip led to a safe level matting. now prepare, young porphyro, for gazing on that bed; she comes, she comes again, like ring-dove fray'd and fled. out went the taper as she hurried in; its little smoke, in pallid moonshine, died: she clos'd the door, she panted, all akin to spirits of the air, and visions wide: no uttered syllable, or, woe betide! but to her heart, her heart was voluble, paining with eloquence her balmy side; as though a tongueless nightingale should swell her throat in vain, and die, heart-stifled, in her dell. a casement high and triple-arch'd there was, all garlanded with carven imag'ries of fruits, and flowers, and bunches of knot-grass, and diamonded with panes of quaint device, innumerable of stains and splendid dyes, as are the tiger-moth's deep-damask'd wings; and in the midst, 'mong thousand heraldries, and twilight saints, and dim emblazonings, a shielded scutcheon blush'd with blood of queens and kings. full on this casement shone the wintry moon, and threw warm gules on madeline's fair breast, as down she knelt for heaven's grace and boon; rose-bloom fell on her hands, together prest, and on her silver cross soft amethyst, and on her hair a glory, like a saint: she seem'd a splendid angel, newly drest, save wings, for heaven:—porphyro grew faint: she knelt, so pure a thing, so free from mortal taint. anon his heart revives: her vespers done, of all its wreathed pearls her hair she frees; unclasps her warmed jewels one by one; loosens her fragrant boddice; by degrees her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees: half-hidden, like a mermaid in sea-weed, pensive awhile she dreams awake, and sees, in fancy, fair st. agnes in her bed, but dares not look behind, or all the charm is fled. soon, trembling in her soft and chilly nest, in sort of wakeful swoon, perplex'd she lay, until the poppied warmth of sleep oppress'd her soothed limbs, and soul fatigued away; flown, like a thought, until the morrow-day; blissfully haven'd both from joy and pain; clasp'd like a missal where swart paynims pray; blinded alike from sunshine and from rain, as though a rose should shut, and be a bud again. stol'n to this paradise, and so entranced, porphyro gaz'd upon her empty dress, and listen'd to her breathing, if it chanced to wake into a slumberous tenderness; which when he heard, that minute did he bless, and breath'd himself: then from the closet crept, noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness, and over the hush'd carpet, silent, stept, and 'tween the curtains peep'd, where, lo!—how fast she slept. then by the bed-side, where the faded moon made a dim, silver twilight, soft he set a table, and, half anguish'd, threw thereon a cloth of woven crimson, gold, and jet:— o for some drowsy morphean amulet! the boisterous, midnight, festive clarion, the kettle-drum, and far-heard clarinet, affray his ears, though but in dying tone:— the hall door shuts again, and all the noise is gone. and still she slept an azure-lidded sleep, in blanched linen, smooth, and lavender'd, while he forth from the closet brought a heap of candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd; with jellies soother than the creamy curd, and lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon; manna and dates, in argosy transferr'd from fez; and spiced dainties, every one, from silken samarcand to cedar'd lebanon. these delicates he heap'd with glowing hand on golden dishes and in baskets bright of wreathed silver: sumptuous they stand in the retired quiet of the night, filling the chilly room with perfume light.— ""and now, my love, my seraph fair, awake! thou art my heaven, and i thine eremite: open thine eyes, for meek st. agnes' sake, or i shall drowse beside thee, so my soul doth ache."" thus whispering, his warm, unnerved arm sank in her pillow. shaded was her dream by the dusk curtains:—'twas a midnight charm impossible to melt as iced stream: the lustrous salvers in the moonlight gleam; broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies: it seem'd he never, never could redeem from such a stedfast spell his lady's eyes; so mus'd awhile, entoil'd in woofed phantasies. awakening up, he took her hollow lute,— tumultuous,—and, in chords that tenderest be, he play'd an ancient ditty, long since mute, in provence call'd, ""la belle dame sans mercy"": close to her ear touching the melody;— wherewith disturb'd, she utter'd a soft moan: he ceas'd—she panted quick—and suddenly her blue affrayed eyes wide open shone: upon his knees he sank, pale as smooth-sculptured stone. her eyes were open, but she still beheld, now wide awake, the vision of her sleep: there was a painful change, that nigh expell'd the blisses of her dream so pure and deep at which fair madeline began to weep, and moan forth witless words with many a sigh; while still her gaze on porphyro would keep; who knelt, with joined hands and piteous eye, fearing to move or speak, she look'd so dreamingly. ""ah, porphyro!"" said she, ""but even now thy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear, made tuneable with every sweetest vow; and those sad eyes were spiritual and clear: how chang'd thou art! how pallid, chill, and drear! give me that voice again, my porphyro, those looks immortal, those complainings dear! oh leave me not in this eternal woe, for if thy diest, my love, i know not where to go."" beyond a mortal man impassion'd far at these voluptuous accents, he arose ethereal, flush'd, and like a throbbing star seen mid the sapphire heaven's deep repose; into her dream he melted, as the rose blendeth its odour with the violet,— solution sweet: meantime the frost-wind blows like love's alarum pattering the sharp sleet against the window-panes; st. agnes' moon hath set. 'tis dark: quick pattereth the flaw-blown sleet: ""this is no dream, my bride, my madeline!"" 'tis dark: the iced gusts still rave and beat: ""no dream, alas! alas! and woe is mine! porphyro will leave me here to fade and pine.— cruel! what traitor could thee hither bring? i curse not, for my heart is lost in thine, though thou forsakest a deceived thing;— a dove forlorn and lost with sick unpruned wing."" ""my madeline! sweet dreamer! lovely bride! say, may i be for aye thy vassal blest? thy beauty's shield, heart-shap'd and vermeil dyed? ah, silver shrine, here will i take my rest after so many hours of toil and quest, a famish'd pilgrim,—sav'd by miracle. though i have found, i will not rob thy nest saving of thy sweet self; if thou think'st well to trust, fair madeline, to no rude infidel. ""hark! 'tis an elfin-storm from faery land, of haggard seeming, but a boon indeed: arise—arise! the morning is at hand;— the bloated wassaillers will never heed:— let us away, my love, with happy speed; there are no ears to hear, or eyes to see,— drown'd all in rhenish and the sleepy mead: awake! arise! my love, and fearless be, for o'er the southern moors i have a home for thee."" she hurried at his words, beset with fears, for there were sleeping dragons all around, at glaring watch, perhaps, with ready spears— down the wide stairs a darkling way they found.— in all the house was heard no human sound. a chain-droop'd lamp was flickering by each door; the arras, rich with horseman, hawk, and hound, flutter'd in the besieging wind's uproar; and the long carpets rose along the gusty floor. they glide, like phantoms, into the wide hall; like phantoms, to the iron porch, they glide; where lay the porter, in uneasy sprawl, with a huge empty flaggon by his side: the wakeful bloodhound rose, and shook his hide, but his sagacious eye an inmate owns: by one, and one, the bolts full easy slide:— the chains lie silent on the footworn stones;— the key turns, and the door upon its hinges groans. and they are gone: ay, ages long ago these lovers fled away into the storm. that night the baron dreamt of many a woe, and all his warrior-guests, with shade and form of witch, and demon, and large coffin-worm, were long be-nightmar'd. angela the old died palsy-twitch'd, with meagre face deform; the beadsman, after thousand aves told, for aye unsought for slept among his ashes cold. <line>","living,death,marriage & companionship,love,first love,infatuation & crushes,romantic love,relationships,men & women,religion,christianity,mythology & folklore,ghosts & the supernatural"

<line>thus much the fathom-line was sent <line>from chillon's snow-white battlement, <line> <line> which round about the wave inthralls: <line>a double dungeon wall and wave <line>have made—and like a living grave <line>below the surface of the lake <line>the dark vault lies wherein we lay: <line>we heard it ripple night and day; <line> <line> sounding o'er our heads it knock'd; <line>and i have felt the winter's spray <line>wash through the bars when winds were high <line>and wanton in the happy sky; <line> <line> and then the very rock hath rock'd, <line> <line> and i have felt it shake, unshock'd, <line>because i could have smiled to see <line>the death that would have set me free. <line> <line> i said my nearer brother pined, <line>i said his mighty heart declined, <line>he loathed and put away his food; <line>it was not that 'twas coarse and rude, <line>for we were used to hunter's fare, <line>and for the like had little care: <line>the milk drawn from the mountain goat <line>was changed for water from the moat, <line>our bread was such as captives' tears <line>have moisten'd many a thousand years, <line>since man first pent his fellow men <line>like brutes within an iron den; <line>but what were these to us or him? <line>these wasted not his heart or limb; <line>my brother's soul was of that mould <line>which in a palace had grown cold, <line>had his free breathing been denied <line>the range of the steep mountain's side; <line>but why delay the truth?—he died. <line>i saw, and could not hold his head, <line>nor reach his dying hand—nor dead,— <line>though hard i strove, but strove in vain, <line>to rend and gnash my bonds in twain. <line>he died—and they unlock'd his chain, <line>and scoop'd for him a shallow grave <line>even from the cold earth of our cave. <line>i begg'd them, as a boon, to lay <line>his corse in dust whereon the day <line>might shine—it was a foolish thought, <line>but then within my brain it wrought, <line>that even in death his freeborn breast <line>in such a dungeon could not rest. <line>i might have spared my idle prayer— <line>they coldly laugh'd—and laid him there: <line>the flat and turfless earth above <line>the being we so much did love; <line>his empty chain above it leant, <line>such murder's fitting monument! <line> <line> but he, the favourite and the flower, <line>most cherish'd since his natal hour, <line>his mother's image in fair face <line>the infant love of all his race <line>his martyr'd father's dearest thought, <line>my latest care, for whom i sought <line>to hoard my life, that his might be <line>less wretched now, and one day free; <line>he, too, who yet had held untired <line>a spirit natural or inspired— <line>he, too, was struck, and day by day <line>was wither'd on the stalk away. <line>oh, god! it is a fearful thing <line>to see the human soul take wing <line>in any shape, in any mood: <line>i've seen it rushing forth in blood, <line>i've seen it on the breaking ocean <line>strive with a swoln convulsive motion, <line>i've seen the sick and ghastly bed <line>of sin delirious with its dread: <line>but these were horrors—this was woe <line>unmix'd with such—but sure and slow: <line>he faded, and so calm and meek, <line>so softly worn, so sweetly weak, <line>so tearless, yet so tender—kind, <line>and grieved for those he left behind; <line>with all the while a cheek whose bloom <line>was as a mockery of the tomb <line>whose tints as gently sunk away <line>as a departing rainbow's ray; <line>an eye of most transparent light, <line>that almost made the dungeon bright; <line>and not a word of murmur—not <line>a groan o'er his untimely lot,— <line>a little talk of better days, <line>a little hope my own to raise, <line>for i was sunk in silence—lost <line>in this last loss, of all the most; <line>and then the sighs he would suppress <line>of fainting nature's feebleness, <line>more slowly drawn, grew less and less: <line>i listen'd, but i could not hear; <line>i call'd, for i was wild with fear; <line>i knew 'twas hopeless, but my dread <line>would not be thus admonishèd; <line>i call'd, and thought i heard a sound— <line>i burst my chain with one strong bound, <line>and rushed to him:—i found him not, <line>i only stirred in this black spot, <line>i only lived, i only drew <line>the accursed breath of dungeon-dew; <line>the last, the sole, the dearest link <line>between me and the eternal brink, <line>which bound me to my failing race <line>was broken in this fatal place. <line>one on the earth, and one beneath— <line>my brothers—both had ceased to breathe: <line>i took that hand which lay so still, <line>alas! my own was full as chill; <line>i had not strength to stir, or strive, <line>but felt that i was still alive— <line>a frantic feeling, when we know <line>that what we love shall ne'er be so. <line> <line> i know not why <line> <line> i could not die, <line>i had no earthly hope—but faith, <line>and that forbade a selfish death. <line> <line> what next befell me then and there <line> <line> i know not well—i never knew— <line>first came the loss of light, and air, <line> <line> and then of darkness too: <line>i had no thought, no feeling—none— <line>among the stones i stood a stone, <line>and was, scarce conscious what i wist, <line>as shrubless crags within the mist; <line>for all was blank, and bleak, and grey; <line>it was not night—it was not day; <line>it was not even the dungeon-light, <line>so hateful to my heavy sight, <line>but vacancy absorbing space, <line>and fixedness—without a place; <line>there were no stars, no earth, no time, <line>no check, no change, no good, no crime <line>but silence, and a stirless breath <line>which neither was of life nor death; <line>a sea of stagnant idleness, <line>blind, boundless, mute, and motionless! <line>a light broke in upon my brain,— <line> <line> it was the carol of a bird; <line>it ceased, and then it came again, <line> <line> the sweetest song ear ever heard, <line>and mine was thankful till my eyes <line>ran over with the glad surprise, <line>and they that moment could not see <line>i was the mate of misery; <line>but then by dull degrees came back <line>my senses to their wonted track; <line>i saw the dungeon walls and floor <line>close slowly round me as before, <line>i saw the glimmer of the sun <line>creeping as it before had done, <line>but through the crevice where it came <line>that bird was perch'd, as fond and tame, <line> <line> and tamer than upon the tree; <line>a lovely bird, with azure wings, <line>and song that said a thousand things, <line> <line> and seemed to say them all for me! <line>i never saw its like before, <line>i ne'er shall see its likeness more: <line>it seem'd like me to want a mate, <line>but was not half so desolate, <line>and it was come to love me when <line>none lived to love me so again, <line>and cheering from my dungeon's brink, <line>had brought me back to feel and think. <line>i know not if it late were free, <line> <line> or broke its cage to perch on mine, <line>but knowing well captivity, <line> <line> sweet bird! i could not wish for thine! <line>or if it were, in wingèd guise, <line>a visitant from paradise; <line>for—heaven forgive that thought! the while <line>which made me both to weep and smile— <line>i sometimes deem'd that it might be <line>my brother's soul come down to me; <line>but then at last away it flew, <line>and then 'twas mortal well i knew, <line>for he would never thus have flown— <line>and left me twice so doubly lone,— <line>lone as the corse within its shroud, <line>lone as a solitary cloud, <line> <line> a single cloud on a sunny day, <line>while all the rest of heaven is clear, <line>a frown upon the atmosphere, <line>that hath no business to appear <line> <line> when skies are blue, and earth is gay. <line> <line> a kind of change came in my fate, <line>my keepers grew compassionate; <line>i know not what had made them so, <line>they were inured to sights of woe, <line>but so it was:—my broken chain <line>with links unfasten'd did remain, <line>and it was liberty to stride <line>along my cell from side to side, <line>and up and down, and then athwart, <line>and tread it over every part; <line>and round the pillars one by one, <line>returning where my walk begun, <line>avoiding only, as i trod, <line>my brothers' graves without a sod; <line>for if i thought with heedless tread <line>my step profaned their lowly bed, <line>my breath came gaspingly and thick, <line>and my crush'd heart felt blind and sick. <line>i made a footing in the wall, <line> <line> it was not therefrom to escape, <line>for i had buried one and all, <line> <line> who loved me in a human shape; <line>and the whole earth would henceforth be <line>a wider prison unto me: <line>no child, no sire, no kin had i, <line>no partner in my misery; <line>i thought of this, and i was glad, <line>for thought of them had made me mad; <line>but i was curious to ascend <line>to my barr'd windows, and to bend <line>once more, upon the mountains high, <line>the quiet of a loving eye. <line> <line> i saw them—and they were the same, <line>they were not changed like me in frame; <line>i saw their thousand years of snow <line>on high—their wide long lake below, <line>and the blue rhone in fullest flow; <line>i heard the torrents leap and gush <line>o'er channell'd rock and broken bush; <line>i saw the white-wall'd distant town, <line>and whiter sails go skimming down; <line>and then there was a little isle, <line>which in my very face did smile, <line> <line> the only one in view; <line>a small green isle, it seem'd no more, <line>scarce broader than my dungeon floor, <line>but in it there were three tall trees, <line>and o'er it blew the mountain breeze, <line>and by it there were waters flowing, <line>and on it there were young flowers growing, <line> <line> of gentle breath and hue. <line>the fish swam by the castle wall, <line>and they seem'd joyous each and all; <line>the eagle rode the rising blast, <line>methought he never flew so fast <line>as then to me he seem'd to fly; <line>and then new tears came in my eye, <line>and i felt troubled—and would fain <line>i had not left my recent chain; <line>and when i did descend again, <line>the darkness of my dim abode <line>fell on me as a heavy load; <line>it was as is a new-dug grave, <line>closing o'er one we sought to save,— <line>and yet my glance, too much opprest, <line>had almost need of such a rest. <line> <line> it might be months, or years, or days— <line> <line> i kept no count, i took no note— <line>i had no hope my eyes to raise, <line> <line> and clear them of their dreary mote; <line>at last men came to set me free; <line> <line> i ask'd not why, and reck'd not where; <line>it was at length the same to me, <line>fetter'd or fetterless to be, <line> <line> i learn'd to love despair. <line>and thus when they appear'd at last, <line>and all my bonds aside were cast, <line>these heavy walls to me had grown <line>a hermitage—and all my own! <line>and half i felt as they were come <line>to tear me from a second home: <line>with spiders i had friendship made <line>and watch'd them in their sullen trade, <line>had seen the mice by moonlight play, <line>and why should i feel less than they? <line>we were all inmates of one place, <line>and i, the monarch of each race, <line>had power to kill—yet, strange to tell! <line>in quiet we had learn'd to dwell; <line>my very chains and i grew friends, <line>so much a long communion tends <line>to make us what we are:—even i <line>regain'd my freedom with a sigh. <line> <line>","living,death,growing old,sorrow & grieving,relationships,family & ancestors,nature,animals,landscapes & pastorals,social commentaries,crime & punishment"

then with transition sweet new speech resumes. thus thou hast seen one world begin and end; and man as from a second stock proceed. much thou hast yet to see, but i perceave thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine must needs impaire and wearie human sense: henceforth what is to com i will relate, thou therefore give due audience, and attend. this second sours of men, while yet but few; and while the dread of judgement past remains fresh in thir mindes, fearing the deitie, with some regard to what is just and right shall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace, labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop, corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock, oft sacrificing bullock, lamb, or kid, with large wine-offerings pour'd, and sacred feast, shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam'd, and dwell long time in peace by families and tribes under paternal rule; till one shall rise of proud ambitious heart, who not content with fair equalitie, fraternal state, will arrogate dominion undeserv'd over his brethren, and quite dispossess concord and law of nature from the earth; hunting (and men not beasts shall be his game) with warr and hostile snare such as refuse subjection to his empire tyrannous: a mightie hunter thence he shall be styl'd before the lord, as in despite of heav'n, or from heav'n claming second sovrantie; and from rebellion shall derive his name, though of rebellion others he accuse. hee with a crew, whom like ambition joyns with him or under him to tyrannize, marching from eden towards the west, shall finde the plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge boiles out from under ground, the mouth of hell; of brick, and of that stuff they cast to build a citie and towre, whose top may reach to heav'n; and get themselves a name, least far disperst in foraign lands thir memorie be lost regardless whether good or evil fame. but god who oft descends to visit men unseen, and through thir habitations walks to mark thir doings, them beholding soon, comes down to see thir citie, ere the tower obstruct heav'n towrs, and in derision sets upon thir tongues a various spirit to rase quite out thir native language, and instead to sow a jangling noise of words unknown: forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud among the builders; each to other calls not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage, as mockt they storm; great laughter was in heav'n and looking down, to see the hubbub strange and hear the din; thus was the building left ridiculous, and the work confusion nam'd. whereto thus adam fatherly displeas'd. o execrable son so to aspire above his brethren, to himself assuming authoritie usurpt, from god not giv'n: he gave us onely over beast, fish, fowl dominion absolute; that right we hold by his donation; but man over men he made not lord; such title to himself reserving, human left from human free. but this usurper his encroachment proud stayes not on man; to god his tower intends siege and defiance: wretched man! what food will he convey up thither to sustain himself and his rash armie, where thin aire above the clouds will pine his entrails gross, and famish him of breath, if not of bread? to whom thus michael. justly thou abhorr'st that son, who on the quiet state of men such trouble brought, affecting to subdue rational libertie; yet know withall, since thy original lapse, true libertie is lost, which alwayes with right reason dwells twinn'd, and from her hath no dividual being: reason in man obscur'd, or not obeyd, immediately inordinate desires and upstart passions catch the government from reason, and to servitude reduce man till then free. therefore since hee permits within himself unworthie powers to reign over free reason, god in judgement just subjects him from without to violent lords; who oft as undeservedly enthrall his outward freedom: tyrannie must be, though to the tyrant thereby no excuse. yet somtimes nations will decline so low from vertue, which is reason, that no wrong, but justice, and some fatal curse annext deprives them of thir outward libertie, thir inward lost: witness th' irreverent son of him who built the ark, who for the shame don to his father, heard this heavie curse, servant of seruants, on his vitious race. thus will this latter, as the former world, still tend from bad to worse, till god at last wearied with their iniquities, withdraw his presence from among them, and avert his holy eyes; resolving from thenceforth to leave them to thir own polluted wayes; and one peculiar nation to select from all the rest, of whom to be invok'd, a nation from one faithful man to spring: him on this side euphrates yet residing, bred up in idol-worship; o that men (canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown, while yet the patriark liv'd, who scap'd the flood, as to forsake the living god, and fall to worship thir own work in wood and stone for gods! yet him god the most high voutsafes to call by vision from his fathers house, his kindred and false gods, into a land which he will shew him, and from him will raise a mightie nation, and upon him showre his benediction so, that in his seed all nations shall be blest; he straight obeys, not knowing to what land, yet firm believes: i see him, but thou canst not, with what faith he leaves his gods, his friends, and native soile ur of chaldaea, passing now the ford to haran, after him a cumbrous train of herds and flocks, and numerous servitude; not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth with god, who call'd him, in a land unknown. canaan he now attains, i see his tents pitcht about sechem, and the neighbouring plaine of moreh; there by promise he receaves gift to his progenie of all that land; from hamath northward to the desert south (things by thir names i call, though yet unnam'd) from hermon east to the great western sea, mount hermon, yonder sea, each place behold in prospect, as i point them; on the shoare mount carmel; here the double-founted stream jordan, true limit eastward; but his sons shall dwell to senir, that long ridge of hills. this ponder, that all nations of the earth shall in his seed be blessed; by that seed is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise the serpents head; whereof to thee anon plainlier shall be reveald. this patriarch blest, whom faithful abraham due time shall call, a son, and of his son a grand-childe leaves, like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown; the grandchilde with twelve sons increast, departs from canaan, to a land hereafter call'd egypt, divided by the river nile; see where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes into the sea: to sojourn in that land he comes invited by a yonger son in time of dearth, a son whose worthy deeds raise him to be the second in that realme of pharao: there he dies, and leaves his race growing into a nation, and now grown suspected to a sequent king, who seeks to stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves inhospitably, and kills thir infant males: till by two brethren (those two brethren call moses and aaron) sent from god to claime his people from enthralment, they return with glory and spoile back to thir promis'd land. but first the lawless tyrant, who denies to know thir god, or message to regard, must be compelld by signes and judgements dire; to blood unshed the rivers must be turnd, frogs, lice and flies must all his palace fill with loath'd intrusion, and fill all the land; his cattel must of rot and murren die, botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss, and all his people; thunder mixt with haile, haile mixt with fire must rend th' egyptian skie and wheel on th' earth, devouring where it rouls; what it devours not, herb, or fruit, or graine, a darksom cloud of locusts swarming down must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green: darkness must overshadow all his bounds, palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes; last with one midnight stroke all the first-born of egypt must lie dead. thus with ten wounds the river-dragon tam'd at length submits to let his sojourners depart, and oft humbles his stubborn heart, but still as ice more hard'nd after thaw, till in his rage pursuing whom he late dismissd, the sea swallows him with his host, but them lets pass as on drie land between two christal walls, aw'd by the rod of moses so to stand divided, till his rescu'd gain thir shoar: such wondrous power god to his saint will lend, though present in his angel, who shall goe before them in a cloud, and pillar of fire, by day a cloud, by night a pillar of fire, to guide them in thir journey, and remove behinde them, while th' obdurat king pursues: all night he will pursue, but his approach darkness defends between till morning watch; then through the firey pillar and the cloud god looking forth will trouble all his host and craze thir chariot wheels: when by command moses once more his potent rod extends over the sea; the sea his rod obeys; on thir imbattelld ranks the waves return, and overwhelm thir warr: the race elect safe towards canaan from the shoar advance through the wilde desert, not the readiest way, least entring on the canaanite allarmd warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare return them back to egypt, choosing rather inglorious life with servitude; for life to noble and ignoble is more sweet untraind in armes, where rashness leads not on. this also shall they gain by thir delay in the wide wilderness, there they shall found thir government, and thir great senate choose through the twelve tribes, to rule by laws ordaind: god from the mount of sinai, whose gray top shall tremble, he descending, will himself in thunder lightning and loud trumpets sound ordaine them lawes; part such as appertaine to civil justice, part religious rites of sacrifice, informing them, by types and shadows, of that destind seed to bruise the serpent, by what means he shall achieve mankinds deliverance. but the voice of god to mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech that moses might report to them his will, and terror cease; he grants what they besaught instructed that to god is no access without mediator, whose high office now moses in figure beares, to introduce one greater, of whose day he shall foretell, and all the prophets in thir age the times of great messiah shall sing. thus laws and rites establisht, such delight hath god in men obedient to his will, that he voutsafes among them to set up his tabernacle, the holy one with mortal men to dwell: by his prescript a sanctuary is fram'd of cedar, overlaid with gold, therein an ark, and in the ark his testimony, the records of his cov'nant, over these a mercie-seat of gold between the wings of two bright cherubim, before him burn seaven lamps as in a zodiac representing the heav'nly fires; over the tent a cloud shall rest by day, a fiery gleame by night, save when they journie, and at length they come, conducted by his angel to the land promisd to abraham and his seed: the rest were long to tell, how many battels fought, how many kings destroyd, and kingdoms won, or how the sun shall in mid heav'n stand still a day entire, and nights due course adjourne, mans voice commanding, sun in gibeon stand, and thou moon in the vale of aialon, till israel overcome; so call the third from abraham, son of isaac, and from him his whole descent, who thus shall canaan win. here adam interpos'd. o sent from heav'n, enlightner of my darkness, gracious things thou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne just abraham and his seed: now first i finde mine eyes true op'ning, and my heart much eas'd, erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom of mee and all mankind; but now i see his day, in whom all nations shall be blest, favour unmerited by me, who sought forbidd'n knowledge by forbidd'n means. this yet i apprehend not, why to those among whom god will deigne to dwell on earth so many and so various laws are giv'n; so many laws argue so many sins among them; how can god with such reside? to whom thus michael. doubt not but that sin will reign among them, as of thee begot; and therefore was law given them to evince thir natural pravitie, by stirring up sin against law to fight; that when they see law can discover sin, but not remove, save by those shadowie expiations weak, the bloud of bulls and goats, they may conclude some bloud more precious must be paid for man, just for unjust, that in such righteousness to them by faith imputed, they may finde justification towards god, and peace of conscience, which the law by ceremonies cannot appease, nor man the moral part perform, and not performing cannot live. so law appears imperfet, and but giv'n with purpose to resign them in full time up to a better cov'nant, disciplin'd from shadowie types to truth, from flesh to spirit, from imposition of strict laws, to free acceptance of large grace, from servil fear to filial, works of law to works of faith. and therefore shall not moses, though of god highly belov'd, being but the minister of law, his people into canaan lead; but joshua whom the gentiles jesus call, his name and office bearing, who shall quell the adversarie serpent, and bring back through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man safe to eternal paradise of rest. meanwhile they in thir earthly canaan plac't long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins national interrupt thir public peace, provoking god to raise them enemies: from whom as oft he saves them penitent by judges first, then under kings; of whom the second, both for pietie renownd and puissant deeds, a promise shall receive irrevocable, that his regal throne for ever shall endure; the like shall sing all prophecie, that of the royal stock of david (so i name this king) shall rise a son, the womans seed to thee foretold, foretold to abraham, as in whom shall trust all nations, and to kings foretold, of kings the last, for of his reign shall be no end. but first a long succession must ensue, and his next son for wealth and wisdom fam'd, the clouded ark of god till then in tents wandring, shall in a glorious temple enshrine. such follow him, as shall be registerd part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle, whose foul idolatries, and other faults heapt to the popular summe, will so incense god, as to leave them, and expose thir land, thir citie, his temple, and his holy ark with all his sacred things, a scorn and prey to that proud citie, whose high walls thou saw'st left in confusion, babylon thence call'd. there in captivitie he lets them dwell the space of seventie years, then brings them back, remembring mercie, and his cov'nant sworn to david, stablisht as the dayes of heav'n. returnd from babylon by leave of kings thir lords, whom god dispos'd, the house of god they first re-edifie, and for a while in mean estate live moderate, till grown in wealth and multitude, factious they grow; but first among the priests dissension springs, men who attend the altar, and should most endeavour peace: thir strife pollution brings upon the temple it self: at last they seise the scepter, and regard not davids sons, then loose it to a stranger, that the true anointed king messiah might be born barr'd of his right; yet at his birth a starr unseen before in heav'n proclaims him com, and guides the eastern sages, who enquire his place, to offer incense, myrrh, and gold; his place of birth a solemn angel tells to simple shepherds, keeping watch by night; they gladly thither haste, and by a quire of squadrond angels hear his carol sung. a virgin is his mother, but his sire the power of the most high; he shall ascend the throne hereditarie, and bound his reign with earths wide bounds, his glory with the heav'ns. he ceas'd, discerning adam with such joy surcharg'd, as had like grief bin dew'd in tears, without the vent of words, which these he breathd. o prophet of glad tidings, finisher of utmost hope! now clear i understand what oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain, why our great expectation should be call'd the seed of woman: virgin mother, haile, high in the love of heav'n, yet from my loynes thou shalt proceed, and from thy womb the son of god most high; so god with man unites. needs must the serpent now his capital bruise expect with mortal paine: say where and when thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the victors heel. to whom thus michael. dream not of thir fight, as of a duel, or the local wounds of head or heel: not therefore joynes the son manhood to god-head, with more strength to foil thy enemie; nor so is overcome satan, whose fall from heav'n, a deadlier bruise, disabl'd not to give thee thy deaths wound: which hee, who comes thy saviour, shall recure, not by destroying satan, but his works in thee and in thy seed: nor can this be, but by fulfilling that which thou didst want, obedience to the law of god, impos'd on penaltie of death, and suffering death, the penaltie to thy transgression due, and due to theirs which out of thine will grow: so onely can high justice rest appaid. the law of god exact he shall fulfill both by obedience and by love, though love alone fulfill the law; thy punishment he shall endure by coming in the flesh to a reproachful life and cursed death, proclaiming life to all who shall believe in his redemption, and that his obedience imputed becomes theirs by faith, his merits to save them, not thir own, though legal works. for this he shall live hated, be blasphem'd, seis'd on by force, judg'd, and to death condemnd a shameful and accurst, naild to the cross by his own nation, slaine for bringing life; but to the cross he nailes thy enemies, the law that is against thee, and the sins of all mankinde, with him there crucifi'd, never to hurt them more who rightly trust in this his satisfaction; so he dies, but soon revives, death over him no power shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light returne, the starres of morn shall see him rise out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light, thy ransom paid, which man from death redeems, his death for man, as many as offerd life neglect not, and the benefit imbrace by faith not void of workes: this god-like act annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy'd, in sin for ever lost from life; this act shall bruise the head of satan, crush his strength defeating sin and death, his two maine armes, and fix farr deeper in his head thir stings then temporal death shall bruise the victors heel, or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep, a gentle wafting to immortal life. nor after resurrection shall he stay longer on earth then certaine times to appeer to his disciples, men who in his life still follow'd him; to them shall leave in charge to teach all nations what of him they learn'd and his salvation, them who shall beleeve baptizing in the profluent stream, the signe of washing them from guilt of sin to life pure, and in mind prepar'd, if so befall, for death, like that which the redeemer dy'd. all nations they shall teach; for from that day not onely to the sons of abrahams loines salvation shall be preacht, but to the sons of abrahams faith wherever through the world; so in his seed all nations shall be blest. then to the heav'n of heav'ns he shall ascend with victory, triumphing through the aire over his foes and thine; there shall surprise the serpent, prince of aire, and drag in chaines through all his realme, and there confounded leave; then enter into glory, and resume his seat at gods right hand, exalted high above all names in heav'n; and thence shall come, when this worlds disolution shall be ripe, with glory and power to judge both quick and dead, to judge th' unfaithful dead, but to reward his faithful, and receave them into bliss, whether in heav'n or earth, for then the earth shall all be paradise, far happier place then this of eden, and far happier daies. so spake th' archangel michael, then paus'd, as at the worlds great period; and our sire replete with joy and wonder thus repli'd. o goodness infinite, goodness immense! that all this good of evil shall produce, and evil turn to good; more wonderful then that which by creation first brought forth light out of darkness! full of doubt i stand, whether i should repent me now of sin by mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce much more, that much more good thereof shall spring, to god more glory, more good will to men from god, and over wrauth grace shall abound. but say, if our deliverer up to heav'n must reascend, what will betide the few his faithful, left among th' unfaithful herd, the enemies of truth; who then shall guide his people, who defend? will they not deale wors with his followers then with him they dealt? be sure they will, said th' angel; but from heav'n hee to his own a comforter will send, the promise of the father, who shall dwell his spirit within them, and the law of faith working through love, upon thir hearts shall write, to guide them in all truth, and also arme with spiritual armour, able to resist satans assaults, and quench his fierie darts, what man can do against them, not affraid, though to the death, against such cruelties with inward consolations recompenc't, and oft supported so as shall amaze thir proudest persecuters: for the spirit powrd first on his apostles, whom he sends to evangelize the nations, then on all baptiz'd, shall them with wondrous gifts endue to speak all tongues, and do all miracles, as did thir lord before them. thus they win great numbers of each nation to receave with joy the tidings brought from heav'n: at length thir ministry perform'd, and race well run, thir doctrine and thir story written left, they die; but in thir room, as they forewarne, wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous wolves, who all the sacred mysteries of heav'n to thir own vile advantages shall turne of lucre and ambition, and the truth with superstitions and traditions taint, left onely in those written records pure, though not but by the spirit understood. then shall they seek to avail themselves of names, places and titles, and with these to joine secular power, though feigning still to act by spiritual, to themselves appropriating the spirit of god, promisd alike and giv'n to all beleevers; and from that pretense, spiritual lawes by carnal power shall force on every conscience; laws which none shall finde left them inrould, or what the spirit within shall on the heart engrave. what will they then but force the spirit of grace it self, and binde his consort libertie; what, but unbuild his living temples, built by faith to stand, thir own faith not anothers: for on earth who against faith and conscience can be heard infallible? yet many will presume: whence heavie persecution shall arise on all who in the worship persevere of spirit and truth; the rest, farr greater part, will deem in outward rites and specious formes religion satisfi'd; truth shall retire bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of faith rarely be found: so shall the world goe on, to good malignant, to bad men benigne, under her own waight groaning till the day appeer of respiration to the just, and vengeance to the wicked, at return of him so lately promis'd to thy aid the womans seed, obscurely then foretold, now amplier known thy saviour and thy lord, last in the clouds from heav'n to be reveald in glory of the father, to dissolve satan with his perverted world, then raise from the conflagrant mass, purg'd and refin'd, new heav'ns, new earth, ages of endless date founded in righteousness and peace and love to bring forth fruits joy and eternal bliss. he ended; and thus adam last reply'd. how soon hath thy prediction, seer blest, measur'd this transient world, the race of time, till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss, eternitie, whose end no eye can reach. greatly instructed i shall hence depart, greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill of knowledge, what this vessel can containe; beyond which was my folly to aspire. henceforth i learne, that to obey is best, and love with fear the onely god, to walk as in his presence, ever to observe his providence, and on him sole depend, mercifull over all his works, with good still overcoming evil, and by small accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise by simply meek; that suffering for truths sake is fortitude to highest victorie, and to the faithful death the gate of life; taught this by his example whom i now acknowledge my redeemer ever blest. to whom thus also th' angel last repli'd: this having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe of wisdome; hope no higher, though all the starrs thou knewst by name, and all th' ethereal powers, all secrets of the deep, all natures works, or works of god in heav'n, aire, earth, or sea, and all the riches of this world enjoydst, and all the rule, one empire; onely add deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add faith, add vertue, patience, temperance, add love, by name to come call'd charitie, the soul of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath to leave this paradise, but shalt possess a paradise within thee, happier farr. let us descend now therefore from this top of speculation; for the hour precise exacts our parting hence; and see the guards, by mee encampt on yonder hill, expect thir motion, at whose front a flaming sword, in signal of remove, waves fiercely round; we may no longer stay: go, waken eve; her also i with gentle dreams have calm'd portending good, and all her spirits compos'd to meek submission: thou at season fit let her with thee partake what thou hast heard, chiefly what may concern her faith to know, the great deliverance by her seed to come (for by the womans seed) on all mankind. that ye may live, which will be many dayes, both in one faith unanimous though sad, with cause for evils past, yet much more cheer'd with meditation on the happie end. he ended, and they both descend the hill; descended, adam to the bowre where eve lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak't; and thus with words not sad she him receav'd. whence thou returnst, and whither wentst, i know; for god is also in sleep, and dreams advise, which he hath sent propitious, some great good presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress wearied i fell asleep: but now lead on; in mee is no delay; with thee to goe, is to stay here; without thee here to stay, is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee art all things under heav'n, all places thou, who for my wilful crime art banisht hence. this further consolation yet secure i carry hence; though all by mee is lost, such favour i unworthie am voutsaft, by mee the promis'd seed shall all restore. so spake our mother eve, and adam heard well pleas'd, but answer'd not; for now too nigh th' archangel stood, and from the other hill to thir fixt station, all in bright array the cherubim descended; on the ground gliding meteorous, as ev'ning mist ris'n from a river o're the marish glides, and gathers ground fast at the labourers heel homeward returning. high in front advanc't, the brandisht sword of god before them blaz'd fierce as a comet; which with torrid heat, and vapour as the libyan air adust, began to parch that temperate clime; whereat in either hand the hastning angel caught our lingring parents, and to th' eastern gate led them direct, and down the cliff as fast to the subjected plaine; then disappeer'd. they looking back, all th' eastern side beheld of paradise, so late thir happie seat, wav'd over by that flaming brand, the gate with dreadful faces throng'd and fierie armes: som natural tears they drop'd, but wip'd them soon; the world was all before them, where to choose thir place of rest, and providence thir guide: they hand in hand with wandring steps and slow, through eden took thir solitarie way. <line>","religion,christianity,god & the divine"

""look forth from the flowers to the sea; for the foam-flowers endure when the rose-blossoms wither, and men that love lightly may die—but we?"" and the same wind sang and the same waves whitened, and or ever the garden's last petals were shed, in the lips that had whispered, the eyes that had lightened, love was dead. or they loved their life through, and then went whither? and were one to the end—but what end who knows? love deep as the sea as a rose must wither, as the rose-red seaweed that mocks the rose. shall the dead take thought for the dead to love them? what love was ever as deep as a grave? they are loveless now as the grass above them or the wave. all are at one now, roses and lovers, not known of the cliffs and the fields and the sea. not a breath of the time that has been hovers in the air now soft with a summer to be. not a breath shall there sweeten the seasons hereafter of the flowers or the lovers that laugh now or weep, when as they that are free now of weeping and laughter we shall sleep. here death may deal not again for ever; here change may come not till all change end. from the graves they have made they shall rise up never, who have left nought living to ravage and rend. earth, stones, and thorns of the wild ground growing, while the sun and the rain live, these shall be; till a last wind's breath upon all these blowing roll the sea. till the slow sea rise and the sheer cliff crumble, till terrace and meadow the deep gulfs drink, till the strength of the waves of the high tides humble the fields that lessen, the rocks that shrink, here now in his triumph where all things falter, stretched out on the spoils that his own hand spread, as a god self-slain on his own strange altar, death lies dead. <line>","activities,gardening,nature,landscapes & pastorals,seas, rivers, & streams,trees & flowers"

sonneteers <line> <line>of the caribbean amphitheatre, <line> <line>in spite of hawk and falcon, green toucan <line> <line>and jay, still to the night-bird made their plea, <line> <line>as if raspberry tanagers in palms, <line> <line>high up in orange air, were barbarous. <line> <line>but crispin was too destitute to find <line> <line>in any commonplace the sought-for aid. <line> <line>he was a man made vivid by the sea, <line> <line>a man come out of luminous traversing, <line> <line>much trumpeted, made desperately clear, <line> <line>fresh from discoveries of tidal skies, <line> <line>to whom oracular rockings gave no rest. <line> <line>into a savage color he went on. <line> <line>how greatly had he grown in his demesne, <line> <line>this auditor of insects! he that saw <line> <line>the stride of vanishing autumn in a park <line> <line>by way of decorous melancholy; he <line> <line>that wrote his couplet yearly to the spring, <line> <line>as dissertation of profound delight, <line> <line>stopping, on voyage, in a land of snakes, <line> <line>found his vicissitudes had much enlarged <line> <line>his apprehension, made him intricate <line> <line>in moody rucks, and difficult and strange <line> <line>in all desires, his destitution's mark. <line> <line>he was in this as other freemen are, <line> <line>sonorous nutshells rattling inwardly. <line> <line>his violence was for aggrandizement <line> <line>and not for stupor, such as music makes <line> <line>for sleepers halfway waking. he perceived <line> <line>that coolness for his heat came suddenly, <line> <line>and only, in the fables that he scrawled <line> <line>with his own quill, in its indigenous dew, <line> <line>of an aesthetic tough, diverse, untamed, <line> <line>incredible to prudes, the mint of dirt, <line> <line>green barbarism turning paradigm. <line> <line>crispin foresaw a curious promenade <line> <line>or, nobler, sensed an elemental fate, <line> <line>and elemental potencies and pangs, <line> <line>and beautiful barenesses as yet unseen, <line> <line>making the most of savagery of palms, <line> <line>of moonlight on the thick, cadaverous bloom <line> <line>that yuccas breed, and of the panther's tread. <line> <line>the fabulous and its intrinsic verse <line> <line>came like two spirits parlaying, adorned <line> <line>in radiance from the atlantic coign, <line> <line>for crispin and his quill to catechize. <line> <line>but they came parlaying of such an earth, <line> <line>so thick with sides and jagged lops of green, <line> <line>so intertwined with serpent-kin encoiled <line> <line>among the purple tufts, the scarlet crowns, <line> <line>scenting the jungle in their refuges, <line> <line>so streaked with yellow, blue and green and red <line> <line>in beak and bud and fruity gobbet-skins, <line> <line>that earth was like a jostling festival <line> <line>of seeds grown fat, too juicily opulent, <line> <line>expanding in the gold's maternal warmth. <line> <line>so much for that. the affectionate emigrant found <line> <line>a new reality in parrot-squawks. <line> <line>yet let that trifle pass. now, as this odd <line> <line>discoverer walked through the harbor streets <line> <line>inspecting the cabildo, the façade <line> <line>of the cathedral, making notes, he heard <line> <line>a rumbling, west of mexico, it seemed, <line> <line>approaching like a gasconade of drums. <line> <line>the white cabildo darkened, the façade, <line> <line>as sullen as the sky, was swallowed up <line> <line>in swift, successive shadows, dolefully. <line> <line>the rumbling broadened as it fell. the wind, <line> <line>tempestuous clarion, with heavy cry, <line> <line>came bluntly thundering, more terrible <line> <line>than the revenge of music on bassoons. <line> <line>gesticulating lightning, mystical, <line> <line>made pallid flitter. crispin, here, took flight. <line> <line>an annotator has his scruples, too. <line> <line>he knelt in the cathedral with the rest, <line> <line>this connoisseur of elemental fate, <line> <line>aware of exquisite thought. the storm was one <line> <line>of many proclamations of the kind, <line> <line>proclaiming something harsher than he learned <line> <line>from hearing signboards whimper in cold nights <line> <line>or seeing the midsummer artifice <line> <line>of heat upon his pane. this was the span <line> <line>of force, the quintessential fact, the note <line> <line>of vulcan, that a valet seeks to own, <line> <line>the thing that makes him envious in phrase. <line> <line>and while the torrent on the roof still droned <line> <line>he felt the andean breath. his mind was free <line> <line>and more than free, elate, intent, profound <line> <line>and studious of a self possessing him, <line> <line>that was not in him in the crusty town <line> <line>from which he sailed. beyond him, westward, lay <line> <line>the mountainous ridges, purple balustrades, <line> <line>in which the thunder, lapsing in its clap, <line> <line>let down gigantic quavers of its voice, <line> <line>for crispin to vociferate again. iii approaching carolina <line> <line>the book of moonlight is not written yet <line> <line>nor half begun, but, when it is, leave room <line> <line>for crispin, fagot in the lunar fire, <line> <line>who, in the hubbub of his pilgrimage <line> <line>through sweating changes, never could forget <line> <line>that wakefulness or meditating sleep, <line> <line>in which the sulky strophes willingly <line> <line>bore up, in time, the somnolent, deep songs. <line> <line>leave room, therefore, in that unwritten book <line> <line>for the legendary moonlight that once burned <line> <line>in crispin's mind above a continent. <line> <line>america was always north to him, <line> <line>a northern west or western north, but north, <line> <line>and thereby polar, polar-purple, chilled <line> <line>and lank, rising and slumping from a sea <line> <line>of hardy foam, receding flatly, spread <line> <line>in endless ledges, glittering, submerged <line> <line>and cold in a boreal mistiness of the moon. <line> <line>the spring came there in clinking pannicles <line> <line>of half-dissolving frost, the summer came, <line> <line>if ever, whisked and wet, not ripening, <line> <line>before the winter's vacancy returned. <line> <line>the myrtle, if the myrtle ever bloomed, <line> <line>was like a glacial pink upon the air. <line> <line>the green palmettoes in crepuscular ice <line> <line>clipped frigidly blue-black meridians, <line> <line>morose chiaroscuro, gauntly drawn. <line> <line>how many poems he denied himself <line> <line>in his observant progress, lesser things <line> <line>than the relentless contact he desired; <line> <line>how many sea-masks he ignored; what sounds <line> <line>he shut out from his tempering ear; what thoughts, <line> <line>like jades affecting the sequestered bride; <line> <line>and what descants, he sent to banishment! <line> <line>perhaps the arctic moonlight really gave <line> <line>the liaison, the blissful liaison, <line> <line>between himself and his environment, <line> <line>which was, and is, chief motive, first delight, <line> <line>for him, and not for him alone. it seemed <line> <line>elusive, faint, more mist than moon, perverse, <line> <line>wrong as a divagation to peking, <line> <line>to him that postulated as his theme <line> <line>the vulgar, as his theme and hymn and flight, <line> <line>a passionately niggling nightingale. <line> <line>moonlight was an evasion, or, if not, <line> <line>a minor meeting, facile, delicate. <line> <line>thus he conceived his voyaging to be <line> <line>an up and down between two elements, <line> <line>a fluctuating between sun and moon, <line> <line>a sally into gold and crimson forms, <line> <line>as on this voyage, out of goblinry, <line> <line>and then retirement like a turning back <line> <line>and sinking down to the indulgences <line> <line>that in the moonlight have their habitude. <line> <line>but let these backward lapses, if they would, <line> <line>grind their seductions on him, crispin knew <line> <line>it was a flourishing tropic he required <line> <line>for his refreshment, an abundant zone, <line> <line>prickly and obdurate, dense, harmonious <line> <line>yet with a harmony not rarefied <line> <line>nor fined for the inhibited instruments <line> <line>of over-civil stops. and thus he tossed <line> <line>between a carolina of old time, <line> <line>a little juvenile, an ancient whim, <line> <line>and the visible, circumspect presentment drawn <line> <line>from what he saw across his vessel's prow. <line> <line>he came. the poetic hero without palms <line> <line>or jugglery, without regalia. <line> <line>and as he came he saw that it was spring, <line> <line>a time abhorrent to the nihilist <line> <line>or searcher for the fecund minimum. <line> <line>the moonlight fiction disappeared. the spring, <line> <line>although contending featly in its veils, <line> <line>irised in dew and early fragrancies, <line> <line>was gemmy marionette to him that sought <line> <line>a sinewy nakedness. a river bore <line> <line>the vessel inward. tilting up his nose, <line> <line>he inhaled the rancid rosin, burly smells <line> <line>of dampened lumber, emanations blown <line> <line>from warehouse doors, the gustiness of ropes, <line> <line>decays of sacks, and all the arrant stinks <line> <line>that helped him round his rude aesthetic out. <line> <line>he savored rankness like a sensualist. <line> <line>he marked the marshy ground around the dock, <line> <line>the crawling railroad spur, the rotten fence, <line> <line>curriculum for the marvellous sophomore. <line> <line>it purified. it made him see how much <line> <line>of what he saw he never saw at all. <line> <line>he gripped more closely the essential prose <line> <line>as being, in a world so falsified, <line> <line>the one integrity for him, the one <line> <line>discovery still possible to make, <line> <line>to which all poems were incident, unless <line> <line>that prose should wear a poem's guise at last. iv the idea of a colony <line> <line>nota: his soil is man's intelligence. <line> <line>that's better. that's worth crossing seas to find. <line> <line>crispin in one laconic phrase laid bare <line> <line>his cloudy drift and planned a colony. <line> <line>exit the mental moonlight, exit lex, <line> <line>rex and principium, exit the whole <line> <line>shebang. exeunt omnes. here was prose <line> <line>more exquisite than any tumbling verse: <line> <line>a still new continent in which to dwell. <line> <line>what was the purpose of his pilgrimage, <line> <line>whatever shape it took in crispin's mind, <line> <line>if not, when all is said, to drive away <line> <line>the shadow of his fellows from the skies, <line> <line>and, from their stale intelligence released, <line> <line>to make a new intelligence prevail? <line> <line>hence the reverberations in the words <line> <line>of his first central hymns, the celebrants <line> <line>of rankest trivia, tests of the strength <line> <line>of his aesthetic, his philosophy, <line> <line>the more invidious, the more desired. <line> <line>the florist asking aid from cabbages, <line> <line>the rich man going bare, the paladin <line> <line>afraid, the blind man as astronomer, <line> <line>the appointed power unwielded from disdain. <line> <line>his western voyage ended and began. <line> <line>the torment of fastidious thought grew slack, <line> <line>another, still more bellicose, came on. <line> <line>he, therefore, wrote his prolegomena, <line> <line>and, being full of the caprice, inscribed <line> <line>commingled souvenirs and prophecies. <line> <line>he made a singular collation. thus: <line> <line>the natives of the rain are rainy men. <line> <line>although they paint effulgent, azure lakes, <line> <line>and april hillsides wooded white and pink, <line> <line>their azure has a cloudy edge, their white <line> <line>and pink, the water bright that dogwood bears. <line> <line>and in their music showering sounds intone. <line> <line>on what strange froth does the gross indian dote, <line> <line>what eden sapling gum, what honeyed gore, <line> <line>what pulpy dram distilled of innocence, <line> <line>that streaking gold should speak in him <line> <line>or bask within his images and words? <line> <line>if these rude instances impeach themselves <line> <line>by force of rudeness, let the principle <line> <line>be plain. for application crispin strove, <line> <line>abhorring turk as esquimau, the lute <line> <line>as the marimba, the magnolia as rose. <line> <line>upon these premises propounding, he <line> <line>projected a colony that should extend <line> <line>to the dusk of a whistling south below the south. <line> <line>a comprehensive island hemisphere. <line> <line>the man in georgia waking among pines <line> <line>should be pine-spokesman. the responsive man, <line> <line>planting his pristine cores in florida, <line> <line>should prick thereof, not on the psaltery, <line> <line>but on the banjo's categorical gut, <line> <line>tuck tuck, while the flamingos flapped his bays. <line> <line>sepulchral señors, bibbing pale mescal, <line> <line>oblivious to the aztec almanacs, <line> <line>should make the intricate sierra scan. <line> <line>and dark brazilians in their cafés, <line> <line>musing immaculate, pampean dits, <line> <line>should scrawl a vigilant anthology, <line> <line>to be their latest, lucent paramour. <line> <line>these are the broadest instances. crispin, <line> <line>progenitor of such extensive scope, <line> <line>was not indifferent to smart detail. <line> <line>the melon should have apposite ritual, <line> <line>performed in verd apparel, and the peach, <line> <line>when its black branches came to bud, belle day, <line> <line>should have an incantation. and again, <line> <line>when piled on salvers its aroma steeped <line> <line>the summer, it should have a sacrament <line> <line>and celebration. shrewd novitiates <line> <line>should be the clerks of our experience. <line> <line>these bland excursions into time to come, <line> <line>related in romance to backward flights, <line> <line>however prodigal, however proud, <line> <line>contained in their afflatus the reproach <line> <line>that first drove crispin to his wandering. <line> <line>he could not be content with counterfeit, <line> <line>with masquerade of thought, with hapless words <line> <line>that must belie the racking masquerade, <line> <line>with fictive flourishes that preordained <line> <line>his passion's permit, hang of coat, degree <line> <line>of buttons, measure of his salt. such trash <line> <line>might help the blind, not him, serenely sly. <line> <line>it irked beyond his patience. hence it was, <line> <line>preferring text to gloss, he humbly served <line> <line>grotesque apprenticeship to chance event, <line> <line>a clown, perhaps, but an aspiring clown. <line> <line>there is a monotonous babbling in our dreams <line> <line>that makes them our dependent heirs, the heirs <line> <line>of dreamers buried in our sleep, and not <line> <line>the oncoming fantasies of better birth. <line> <line>the apprentice knew these dreamers. if he dreamed <line> <line>their dreams, he did it in a gingerly way. <line> <line>all dreams are vexing. let them be expunged. <line> <line>but let the rabbit run, the cock declaim. <line> <line>trinket pasticcio, flaunting skyey sheets, <line> <line>with crispin as the tiptoe cozener? <line> <line>no, no: veracious page on page, exact. v a nice shady home <line> <line>crispin as hermit, pure and capable, <line> <line>dwelt in the land. perhaps if discontent <line> <line>had kept him still the pricking realist, <line> <line>choosing his element from droll confect <line> <line>of was and is and shall or ought to be, <line> <line>beyond bordeaux, beyond havana, far <line> <line>beyond carked yucatan, he might have come <line> <line>to colonize his polar planterdom <line> <line>and jig his chits upon a cloudy knee. <line> <line>but his emprize to that idea soon sped. <line> <line>crispin dwelt in the land and dwelling there <line> <line>slid from his continent by slow recess <line> <line>to things within his actual eye, alert <line> <line>to the difficulty of rebellious thought <line> <line>when the sky is blue. the blue infected will. <line> <line>it may be that the yarrow in his fields <line> <line>sealed pensive purple under its concern. <line> <line>but day by day, now this thing and now that <line> <line>confined him, while it cosseted, condoned, <line> <line>little by little, as if the suzerain soil <line> <line>abashed him by carouse to humble yet <line> <line>attach. it seemed haphazard denouement. <line> <line>he first, as realist, admitted that <line> <line>whoever hunts a matinal continent <line> <line>may, after all, stop short before a plum <line> <line>and be content and still be realist. <line> <line>the words of things entangle and confuse. <line> <line>the plum survives its poems. it may hang <line> <line>in the sunshine placidly, colored by ground <line> <line>obliquities of those who pass beneath, <line> <line>harlequined and mazily dewed and mauved <line> <line>in bloom. yet it survives in its own form, <line> <line>beyond these changes, good, fat, guzzly fruit. <line> <line>so crispin hasped on the surviving form, <line> <line>for him, of shall or ought to be in is. <line> <line>was he to bray this in profoundest brass <line> <line>arointing his dreams with fugal requiems? <line> <line>was he to company vastest things defunct <line> <line>with a blubber of tom-toms harrowing the sky? <line> <line>scrawl a tragedian's testament? prolong <line> <line>his active force in an inactive dirge, <line> <line>which, let the tall musicians call and call, <line> <line>should merely call him dead? pronounce amen <line> <line>through choirs infolded to the outmost clouds? <line> <line>because he built a cabin who once planned <line> <line>loquacious columns by the ructive sea? <line> <line>because he turned to salad-beds again? <line> <line>jovial crispin, in calamitous crape? <line> <line>should he lay by the personal and make <line> <line>of his own fate an instance of all fate? <line> <line>what is one man among so many men? <line> <line>what are so many men in such a world? <line> <line>can one man think one thing and think it long? <line> <line>can one man be one thing and be it long? <line> <line>the very man despising honest quilts <line> <line>lies quilted to his poll in his despite. <line> <line>for realists, what is is what should be. <line> <line>and so it came, his cabin shuffled up, <line> <line>his trees were planted, his duenna brought <line> <line>her prismy blonde and clapped her in his hands, <line> <line>the curtains flittered and the door was closed. <line> <line>crispin, magister of a single room, <line> <line>latched up the night. so deep a sound fell down <line> <line>it was as if the solitude concealed <line> <line>and covered him and his congenial sleep. <line> <line>so deep a sound fell down it grew to be <line> <line>a long soothsaying silence down and down. <line> <line>the crickets beat their tambours in the wind, <line> <line>marching a motionless march, custodians. <line> <line>in the presto of the morning, crispin trod, <line> <line>each day, still curious, but in a round <line> <line>less prickly and much more condign than that <line> <line>he once thought necessary. like candide, <line> <line>yeoman and grub, but with a fig in sight, <line> <line>and cream for the fig and silver for the cream, <line> <line>a blonde to tip the silver and to taste <line> <line>the rapey gouts. good star, how that to be <line> <line>annealed them in their cabin ribaldries! <line> <line>yet the quotidian saps philosophers <line> <line>and men like crispin like them in intent, <line> <line>if not in will, to track the knaves of thought. <line> <line>but the quotidian composed as his, <line> <line>of breakfast ribands, fruits laid in their leaves, <line> <line>the tomtit and the cassia and the rose, <line> <line>although the rose was not the noble thorn <line> <line>of crinoline spread, but of a pining sweet, <line> <line>composed of evenings like cracked shutters flung <line> <line>upon the rumpling bottomness, and nights <line> <line>in which those frail custodians watched, <line> <line>indifferent to the tepid summer cold, <line> <line>while he poured out upon the lips of her <line> <line>that lay beside him, the quotidian <line> <line>like this, saps like the sun, true fortuner. <line> <line>for all it takes it gives a humped return <line> <line>exchequering from piebald fiscs unkeyed. vi and daughters with curls <line> <line>portentous enunciation, syllable <line> <line>to blessed syllable affined, and sound <line> <line>bubbling felicity in cantilene, <line> <line>prolific and tormenting tenderness <line> <line>of music, as it comes to unison, <line> <line>forgather and bell boldly crispin's last <line> <line>deduction. thrum, with a proud douceur <line> <line>his grand pronunciamento and devise. <line> <line>the chits came for his jigging, bluet-eyed, <line> <line>hands without touch yet touching poignantly, <line> <line>leaving no room upon his cloudy knee, <line> <line>prophetic joint, for its diviner young. <line> <line>the return to social nature, once begun, <line> <line>anabasis or slump, ascent or chute, <line> <line>involved him in midwifery so dense <line> <line>his cabin counted as phylactery, <line> <line>then place of vexing palankeens, then haunt <line> <line>of children nibbling at the sugared void, <line> <line>infants yet eminently old, then dome <line> <line>and halidom for the unbraided femes, <line> <line>green crammers of the green fruits of the world, <line> <line>bidders and biders for its ecstasies, <line> <line>true daughters both of crispin and his clay. <line> <line>all this with many mulctings of the man, <line> <line>effective colonizer sharply stopped <line> <line>in the door-yard by his own capacious bloom. <line> <line>but that this bloom grown riper, showing nibs <line> <line>of its eventual roundness, puerile tints <line> <line>of spiced and weathery rouges, should complex <line> <line>the stopper to indulgent fatalist <line> <line>was unforeseen. first crispin smiled upon <line> <line>his goldenest demoiselle, inhabitant, <line> <line>she seemed, of a country of the capuchins, <line> <line>so delicately blushed, so humbly eyed, <line> <line>attentive to a coronal of things <line> <line>secret and singular. second, upon <line> <line>a second similar counterpart, a maid <line> <line>most sisterly to the first, not yet awake <line> <line>excepting to the motherly footstep, but <line> <line>marvelling sometimes at the shaken sleep. <line> <line>then third, a thing still flaxen in the light, <line> <line>a creeper under jaunty leaves. and fourth, <line> <line>mere blusteriness that gewgaws jollified, <line> <line>all din and gobble, blasphemously pink. <line> <line>a few years more and the vermeil capuchin <line> <line>gave to the cabin, lordlier than it was, <line> <line>the dulcet omen fit for such a house. <line> <line>the second sister dallying was shy <line> <line>to fetch the one full-pinioned one himself <line> <line>out of her botches, hot embosomer. <line> <line>the third one gaping at the orioles <line> <line>lettered herself demurely as became <line> <line>a pearly poetess, peaked for rhapsody. <line> <line>the fourth, pent now, a digit curious. <line> <line>four daughters in a world too intricate <line> <line>in the beginning, four blithe instruments <line> <line>of differing struts, four voices several <line> <line>in couch, four more personæ, intimate <line> <line>as buffo, yet divers, four mirrors blue <line> <line>that should be silver, four accustomed seeds <line> <line>hinting incredible hues, four self-same lights <line> <line>that spread chromatics in hilarious dark, <line> <line>four questioners and four sure answerers. <line> <line>crispin concocted doctrine from the rout. <line> <line>the world, a turnip once so readily plucked, <line> <line>sacked up and carried overseas, daubed out <line> <line>of its ancient purple, pruned to the fertile main, <line> <line>and sown again by the stiffest realist, <line> <line>came reproduced in purple, family font, <line> <line>the same insoluble lump. the fatalist <line> <line>stepped in and dropped the chuckling down his craw, <line> <line>without grace or grumble. score this anecdote <line> <line>invented for its pith, not doctrinal <line> <line>in form though in design, as crispin willed, <line> <line>disguised pronunciamento, summary, <line> <line>autumn's compendium, strident in itself <line> <line>but muted, mused, and perfectly revolved <line> <line>in those portentous accents, syllables, <line> <line>and sounds of music coming to accord <line> <line>upon his law, like their inherent sphere, <line> <line>seraphic proclamations of the pure <line> <line>delivered with a deluging onwardness. <line> <line>or if the music sticks, if the anecdote <line> <line>is false, if crispin is a profitless <line> <line>philosopher, beginning with green brag, <line> <line>concluding fadedly, if as a man <line> <line>prone to distemper he abates in taste, <line> <line>fickle and fumbling, variable, obscure, <line> <line>glozing his life with after-shining flicks, <line> <line>illuminating, from a fancy gorged <line> <line>by apparition, plain and common things, <line> <line>sequestering the fluster from the year, <line> <line>making gulped potions from obstreperous drops, <line> <line>and so distorting, proving what he proves <line> <line>is nothing, what can all this matter since <line> <line>the relation comes, benignly, to its end? <line> <line>so may the relation of each man be clipped. <line>","living,parenthood,the mind,activities,travels & journeys,relationships,home life,nature,fall,seas, rivers, & streams,spring,arts & sciences,humor &

<line> <line>it is a language for the oldest spells <line> <line>about how some thoughts rose into the mind <line> <line>while others, stranger still, sleep in the world. <line> <line>so grows the garden green, the sun vermilion. <line> <line>he sees the rose flame up and fade and fall <line> <line>and be the same rose still, the radiant in red. <line> <line>he paints his language, and his language is <line> <line>the theory of what the painter thinks. <line> <line>iii <line> <line>the painter’s eye attends to death and birth <line> <line>together, seeing a single energy <line> <line>momently manifest in every form, <line> <line>as in the tree the growing of the tree <line> <line>exploding from the seed not more nor less <line> <line>than from the void condensing down and in, <line> <line>summoning sun and rain. he views the tree, <line> <line>the great tree standing in the garden, say, <line> <line>as thrusting downward its vast spread and weight, <line> <line>growing its green height from the dark watered earth, <line> <line>and as suspended weightless in the sky, <line> <line>haled forth and held up by the hair of its head. <line> <line>he follows through the flowing of the forms <line> <line>from the divisions of the trunk out to <line> <line>the veinings of the leaf, and the leaf’s fall. <line> <line>his pencil meditates the many in the one <line> <line>after the method in the confluence of rivers, <line> <line>the running of ravines on mountainsides, <line> <line>and in the deltas of the nerves; he sees <line> <line>how things must be continuous with themselves <line> <line>as with whole worlds that they themselves are not, <line> <line>in order that they may be so transformed. <line> <line>he stands where the eternity of thought <line> <line>opens upon perspective time and space; <line> <line>he watches mind become incarnate; then <line> <line> he paints the tree. <line> <line>iv <line> <line>these thoughts have chiefly been about the painter klee, <line> <line>about how he in our hard time might stand to us <line> <line>especially whose lives concern themselves with learning <line> <line>as patron of the practical intelligence of art, <line> <line>and thence as model, modest and humorous in sufferings, <line> <line>for all research that follows spirit where it goes. <line> <line>that there should be much goodness in the world, <line> <line>much kindness and intelligence, candor and charm, <line> <line>and that it all goes down in the dust after a while, <line> <line>this is a subject for the steadiest meditations <line> <line>of the heart and mind, as for the tears <line> <line>that clarify the eye toward charity. <line> <line>so may it be to all of us, that at some times <line> <line>in this bad time when faith in study seems to fail, <line> <line>and when impatience in the street and still despair at home <line> <line>divide the mind to rule it, there shall be some comfort come <line> <line>from the remembrance of so deep and clear a life as his <line> <line>whom i have thought of, for the wholeness of his mind, <line> <line>as the painter dreaming in the scholar’s house, <line> <line>his dream an emblem to us of the life of thought, <line> <line>the same dream that then flared before intelligence <line> <line>when light first went forth looking for the eye. <line>","the body,activities,school & learning,nature,religion,other religions,arts & sciences,painting & sculpture,philosophy"

9807,7268,"<line> <line>forth from calais, at dawn of night, when sunset summer on autumn shone, fared the steamer alert and loud through seas whence only the sun was gone: soft and sweet as the sky they smiled, and bade man welcome: a dim sweet hour gleamed and whispered in wind and sea, and heaven was fair as a field in flower, stars fulfilled the desire of the darkling world as with music: the star-bright air made the face of the sea, if aught may make the face of the sea, more fair. whence came change? was the sweet night weary of rest? what anguish awoke in the dark? sudden, sublime, the strong storm spake: we heard the thunders as hounds that bark. lovelier if aught may be lovelier than stars, we saw the lightnings exalt the sky, living and lustrous and rapturous as love that is born but to quicken and lighten and die. heaven's own heart at its highest of delight found utterance in music and semblance in fire: thunder on thunder exulted, rejoicing to live and to satiate the night's desire. and the night was alive and anhungered of life as a tiger from toils cast free: and a rapture of rage made joyous the spirit and strength of the soul of the sea. all the weight of the wind bore down on it, freighted with death for fraught: and the keen waves kindled and quickened as things transfigured or things distraught. and madness fell on them laughing and leaping; and madness came on the wind: and the might and the light and the darkness of storm were as storm in the heart of ind. such glory, such terror, such passion, as lighten and harrow the far fierce east, rang, shone, spake, shuddered around us: the night was an altar with death for priest. the channel that sunders england from shores where never was man born free was clothed with the likeness and thrilled with the strength and the wrath of a tropic sea. as a wild steed ramps in rebellion, and rears till it swerves from a backward fall, the strong ship struggled and reared, and her deck was upright as a sheer cliff's wall. stern and prow plunged under, alternate: a glimpse, a recoil, a breath, and she sprang as the life in a god made man would spring at the throat of death. three glad hours, and it seemed not an hour of supreme and supernal joy, filled full with delight that revives in remembrance a sea-bird's heart in a boy. for the central crest of the night was cloud that thundered and flamed, sublime as the splendour and song of the soul everlasting that quickens the pulse of time. the glory beholden of man in a vision, the music of light overheard, the rapture and radiance of battle, the life that abides in the fire of a word, in the midmost heaven enkindled, was manifest far on the face of the sea, and the rage in the roar of the voice of the waters was heard but when heaven breathed free. far eastward, clear of the covering of cloud, the sky laughed out into light from the rims of the storm to the sea's dark edge with flames that were flowerlike and white. the leaping and luminous blossoms of live sheet lightning that laugh as they fade from the cloud's black base to the black wave's brim rejoiced in the light they made. far westward, throned in a silent sky, where life was in lustrous tune, shone, sweeter and surer than morning or evening, the steadfast smile of the moon. the limitless heaven that enshrined them was lovelier than dreams may behold, and deep as life or as death, revealed and transfigured, may shine on the soul through sleep. all glories of toil and of triumph and passion and pride that it yearns to know bore witness there to the soul of its likeness and kinship, above and below. the joys of the lightnings, the songs of the thunders, the strong sea's labour and rage, were tokens and signs of the war that is life and is joy for the soul to wage. no thought strikes deeper or higher than the heights and the depths that the night made bare, illimitable, infinite, awful and joyful, alive in the summit of air— air stilled and thrilled by the tempest that thundered between its reign and the sea's, rebellious, rapturous, and transient as faith or as terror that bows men's knees. no love sees loftier and fairer the form of its godlike vision in dreams than the world shone then, when the sky and the sea were as love for a breath's length seems— one utterly, mingled and mastering and mastered and laughing with love that subsides as the glad mad night sank panting and satiate with storm, and released the tides. in the dense mid channel the steam-souled ship hung hovering, assailed and withheld as a soul born royal, if life or if death be against it, is thwarted and quelled. as the glories of myriads of glowworms in lustrous grass on a boundless lawn were the glories of flames phosphoric that made of the water a light like dawn. a thousand phosphors, a thousand hespers, awoke in the churning sea, and the swift soft hiss of them living and dying was clear as a tune could be; as a tune that is played by the fingers of death on the keys of life or of sleep, audible alway alive in the storm, too fleet for a dream to keep: too fleet, too sweet for a dream to recover and thought to remember awake: light subtler and swifter than lightning, that whispers and laughs in the live storm's wake, in the wild bright wake of the storm, in the dense loud heart of the labouring hour, a harvest of stars by the storm's hand reaped, each fair as a star-shaped flower. and sudden and soft as the passing of sleep is the passing of tempest seemed when the light and the sound of it sank, and the glory was gone as a dream half dreamed. the glory, the terror, the passion that made of the midnight a miracle, died, not slain at a stroke, nor in gradual reluctance abated of power and of pride; with strong swift subsidence, awful as power that is wearied of power upon earth, as a god that were wearied of power upon heaven, and were fain of a new god's birth, the might of the night subsided: the tyranny kindled in darkness fell: and the sea and the sky put off them the rapture and radiance of heaven and of hell. the waters, heaving and hungering at heart, made way, and were wellnigh fain, for the ship that had fought them, and wrestled, and revelled in labour, to cease from her pain. and an end was made of it: only remembrance endures of the glad loud strife; and the sense that a rapture so royal may come not again in the passage of life. <line>","activities,travels & journeys,nature,seas, rivers, & streams"

then clad with incense, where the golden altar fum'd, by thir great intercessor, came in sight before the fathers throne: them the glad son presenting, thus to intercede began. see father, what first fruits on earth are sprung from thy implanted grace in man, these sighs and prayers, which in this golden censer, mixt with incense, i thy priest before thee bring, fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed sow'n with contrition in his heart, then those which his own hand manuring all the trees of paradise could have produc't, ere fall'n from innocence. now therefore bend thine eare to supplication, heare his sighs though mute; unskilful with what words to pray, iet mee interpret for him, mee his advocate and propitiation, all his works on mee good or not good ingraft, my merit those shall perfet, and for these my death shall pay. accept me, and in mee from these receave the smell of peace toward mankinde, let him live before thee reconcil'd, at least his days numberd, though sad, till death, his doom (which i to mitigate thus plead, not to reverse) to better life shall yeeld him, where with mee all my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss, made one with me as i with thee am one. to whom the father, without cloud, serene. all thy request for man, accepted son, obtain, all thy request was my decree: but longer in that paradise to dwell, the law i gave to nature him forbids: those pure immortal elements that know no gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule, eject him tainted now, and purge him off as a distemper, gross to aire as gross, and mortal food, as may dispose him best for dissolution wrought by sin, that first distemperd all things, and of incorrupt corrupted. i at first with two fair gifts created him endowd, with happiness and immortalitie: that fondly lost, this other serv'd but to eternize woe; till i provided death; so death becomes his final remedie, and after life tri'd in sharp tribulation, and refin'd by faith and faithful works, to second life, wak't in the renovation of the just, resignes him up with heav'n and earth renewd. but let us call to synod all the blest through heav'ns wide bounds; from them i will not hide my judgments, how with mankind i proceed, as how with peccant angels late they saw; and in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd. he ended, and the son gave signal high to the bright minister that watchd, hee blew his trumpet, heard in oreb since perhaps when god descended, and perhaps once more to sound at general doom. th' angelic blast filld all the regions: from thir blissful bowrs of amarantin shade, fountain or spring, by the waters of life, where ere they sate in fellowships of joy: the sons of light hasted, resorting to the summons high, and took thir seats; till from his throne supream th' almighty thus pronouncd his sovran will. o sons, like one of us man is become to know both good and evil, since his taste of that defended fruit; but let him boast his knowledge of good lost, and evil got, happier, had it suffic'd him to have known good by it self, and evil not at all. he sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite, my motions in him, longer then they move, his heart i know, how variable and vain self-left. least therefore his now bolder hand reach also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever, dream at least to live for ever, to remove him i decree, and send him from the garden forth to till the ground whence he was taken, fitter soile. michael, this my behest have thou in charge, take to thee from among the cherubim thy choice of flaming warriours, least the fiend or in behalf of man, or to invade vacant possession som new trouble raise: hast thee, and from the paradise of god without remorse drive out the sinful pair, from hallowd ground th' unholie, and denounce to them and to thir progenie from thence perpetual banishment. yet least they faint at the sad sentence rigorously urg'd, for i behold them softn'd and with tears bewailing thir excess, all terror hide. if patiently thy bidding they obey, dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale to adam what shall come in future dayes, as i shall thee enlighten, intermix my cov'nant in the womans seed renewd; so send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace: and on the east side of the garden place, where entrance up from eden easiest climbes, cherubic watch, and of a sword the flame wide waving, all approach farr off to fright, and guard all passage to the tree of life: least paradise a receptacle prove to spirits foule, and all my trees thir prey, with whose stol'n fruit man once more to delude. he ceas'd; and th' archangelic power prepar'd for swift descent, with him the cohort bright of watchful cherubim; four faces each had, like a double janus, all thir shape spangl'd with eyes more numerous then those of argus, and more wakeful then to drouze, charm'd with arcadian pipe, the pastoral reed of hermes, or his opiate rod. mean while to resalute the world with sacred light leucothea wak'd, and with fresh dews imbalmd the earth, when adam and first matron eve had ended now thir orisons, and found strength added from above, new hope to spring out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt; which thus to eve his welcome words renewd. eve, easily may faith admit, that all the good which we enjoy, from heav'n descends; but that from us ought should ascend to heav'n so prevalent as to concerne the mind of god high-blest, or to incline his will, hard to belief may seem; yet this will prayer, or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne ev'n to the seat of god. for since i saught by prayer th' offended deitie to appease, kneel'd and before him humbl'd all my heart, methought i saw him placable and mild, bending his eare; perswasion in me grew that i was heard with favour; peace returnd home to my brest, and to my memorie his promise, that thy seed shall bruise our foe; which then not minded in dismay, yet now assures me that the bitterness of death is past, and we shall live. whence haile to thee, eve rightly call'd, mother of all mankind, mother of all things living, since by thee man is to live, and all things live for man. to whom thus eve with sad demeanour meek. ill worthie i such title should belong to me transgressour, who for thee ordaind a help, became thy snare; to mee reproach rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise: but infinite in pardon was my judge, that i who first brought death on all, am grac't the sourse of life; next favourable thou, who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf'st, farr other name deserving. but the field to labour calls us now with sweat impos'd, though after sleepless night; for see the morn, all unconcern'd with our unrest, begins her rosie progress smiling; let us forth, i never from thy side henceforth to stray, wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell, what can be toilsom in these pleasant walkes? here let us live, though in fall'n state, content. so spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd eve, but fate subscrib'd not; nature first gave signs, imprest on bird, beast, aire, aire suddenly eclips'd after short blush of morn; nigh in her sight the bird of jove, stoopt from his aerie tour, two birds of gayest plume before him drove: down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods, first hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace, goodliest of all the forrest, hart and hinde; direct to th' eastern gate was bent thir flight. adam observ'd, and with his eye the chase pursuing, not unmov'd to eve thus spake. o eve, some furder change awaits us nigh, which heav'n by these mute signs in nature shews forerunners of his purpose, or to warn us haply too secure of our discharge from penaltie, because from death releast some days; how long, and what till then our life, who knows, or more then this, that we are dust, and thither must return and be no more. why else this double object in our fight of flight pursu'd in th' air and ore the ground one way the self-same hour? why in the east darkness ere dayes mid-course, and morning light more orient in yon western cloud that draws o're the blew firmament a radiant white, and slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught. he err'd not, for by this the heav'nly bands down from a skie of jasper lighted now in paradise, and on a hill made alt, a glorious apparition, had not doubt and carnal fear that day dimm'd adams eye. not that more glorious, when the angels met jacob in mahanaim, where he saw the field pavilion'd with his guardians bright; nor that which on the flaming mount appeerd in dothan, cover'd with a camp of fire, against the syrian king, who to surprize one man, assassin-like had levied warr, warr unproclam'd. the princely hierarch in thir bright stand, there left his powers to seise possession of the garden; hee alone, to find where adam shelterd, took his way, not unperceav'd of adam, who to eve, while the great visitant approachd, thus spake. eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps of us will soon determin, or impose new laws to be observ'd; for i descrie from yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill one of the heav'nly host, and by his gate none of the meanest, some great potentate or of the thrones above, such majestie invests him coming; yet not terrible, that i should fear, nor sociably mild, as raphael, that i should much confide, but solemn and sublime, whom not to offend, with reverence i must meet, and thou retire. he ended; and th' arch-angel soon drew nigh, not in his shape celestial, but as man clad to meet man; over his lucid armes a militarie vest of purple flowd livelier then meliboean, or the graine of sarra, worn by kings and hero's old in time of truce; lris had dipt the wooff; his starrie helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime in manhood where youth ended; by his side as in a glistering zodiac hung the sword, satans dire dread, and in his hand the spear. adam bowd low, hee kingly from his state inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd. adam, heav'ns high behest no preface needs: sufficient that thy prayers are heard, and death, then due by sentence when thou didst transgress, defeated of his seisure many dayes giv'n thee of grace, wherein thou may'st repent, and one bad act with many deeds well done mayst cover: well may then thy lord appeas'd redeem thee quite from deaths rapacious claime; but longer in this paradise to dwell permits not; to remove thee i am come, and send thee from the garden forth to till the ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter soile. he added not, for adam at the newes heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, that all his senses bound; eve, who unseen yet all had heard, with audible lament discover'd soon the place of her retire. o unexpected stroke, worse then of death! must i thus leave thee paradise? thus leave thee native soile, these happie walks and shades, fit haunt of gods? where i had hope to spend, quiet though sad, the respit of that day that must be mortal to us both. o flours, that never will in other climate grow, my early visitation, and my last at eev'n, which i bred up with tender hand from the first op'ning bud, and gave ye names, who now shall reare ye to the sun, or ranke your tribes, and water from th' ambrosial fount? thee lastly nuptial bowre, by mee adornd with what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee how shall i part, and whither wander down into a lower world, to this obscure and wilde, how shall we breath in other aire less pure, accustomd to immortal fruits? whom thus the angel interrupted milde. lament not eve, but patiently resigne what justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart, thus over-fond, on that which is not thine; thy going is not lonely, with thee goes thy husband, him to follow thou art bound; where he abides, think there thy native soile. adam by this from the cold sudden damp recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd, to michael thus his humble words addressd. celestial, whether among the thrones, or nam'd of them the highest, for such of shape may seem prince above princes, gently hast thou tould thy message, which might else in telling wound, and in performing end us; what besides of sorrow and dejection and despair our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring, departure from this happy place, our sweet recess, and onely consolation left familiar to our eyes, all places else inhospitable appeer and desolate, nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer incessant i could hope to change the will of him who all things can, i would not cease to wearie him with my assiduous cries: but prayer against his absolute decree no more availes then breath against the winde, blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth: therefore to his great bidding i submit. this most afflicts me, that departing hence, as from his face i shall be hid, deprivd his blessed count'nance; here i could frequent, with worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd presence divine, and to my sons relate; on this mount he appeerd, under this tree stood visible, among these pines his voice i heard, here with him at this fountain talk'd: so many grateful altars i would reare of grassie terfe, and pile up every stone of lustre from the brook, in memorie, or monument to ages, and thereon offer sweet smelling gumms and fruits and flours: in yonder nether world where shall i seek his bright appearances, or foot-step trace? for though i fled him angrie, yet recall'd to life prolongd and promisd race, i now gladly behold though but his utmost skirts of glory, and farr off his steps adore. to whom thus michael with regard benigne. adam, thou know'st heav'n his, and all the earth. not this rock onely; his omnipresence fills land, sea, and aire, and every kinde that lives, fomented by his virtual power and warmd: all th' earth he gave thee to possess and rule, no despicable gift; surmise not then his presence to these narrow bounds confin'd of paradise or eden: this had been perhaps thy capital seate, from whence had spred all generations, and had hither come from all the ends of th' earth, to celebrate and reverence thee thir great progenitor. but this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down to dwell on eeven ground now with thy sons: yet doubt not but in vallie and in plaine god is as here, and will be found alike present, and of his presence many a signe still following thee, still compassing thee round with goodness and paternal love, his face express, and of his steps the track divine. which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd ere thou from hence depart, know i am sent to shew thee what shall come in future dayes to thee and to thy ofspring; good with bad expect to hear, supernal grace contending with sinfulness of men; thereby to learn true patience, and to temper joy with fear and pious sorrow, equally enur'd by moderation either state to beare, prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure thy mortal passage when it comes. ascend this hill; let eve (for i have drencht her eyes) here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st, as once thou slepst, while shee to life was formd. to whom thus adam gratefully repli'd. ascend, i follow thee, safe guide, the path thou lead'st me, and to the hand of heav'n submit, however chast'ning, to the evil turne my obvious breast, arming to overcom by suffering, and earne rest from labour won, if so i may attain. so both ascend in the visions of god: it was a hill of paradise the highest, from whose top the hemisphere of earth in cleerest ken stretcht out to the amplest reach of prospect lay. not higher that hill nor wider looking round, whereon for different cause the tempter set our second adam in the wilderness, to shew him all earths kingdomes and thir glory. his eye might there command wherever stood city of old or modern fame, the seat of mightiest empire, from the destind walls of cambalu, seat of cathaian can and samarchand by oxus, temirs throne, to paquin of sinaean kings, and thence to agra and lahor of great mogul down to the golden chersonese, or where the persian in ecbatan sate, or since in hispahan, or where the russian ksar in mosco, or the sultan in bizance, turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken th' empire of negus to his utmost port ercoco and the less maritim kings mombaza, and quiloa, and melind, and sofala thought ophir, to the realme of congo, and angola fardest south; or thence from niger flood to atlas mount the kingdoms of almansor, fez and sus, marocco and algiers, and tremisen; on europe thence, and where rome was to sway the world: in spirit perhaps he also saw rich mexico the seat of motezume, and cusco in peru, the richer seat of atabalipa, and yet unspoil'd guiana, whose great citie geryons sons call el dorado: but to nobler sights michael from adams eyes the filme remov'd which that false fruit that promis'd clearer sight had bred; then purg'd with euphrasie and rue the visual nerve, for he had much to see; and from the well of life three drops instill'd. so deep the power of these ingredients pierc'd, eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight, that adam now enforc't to close his eyes, sunk down and all his spirits became intranst: but him the gentle angel by the hand soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd. adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought in some to spring from thee, who never touch'd th' excepted tree, nor with the snake conspir'd, nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive corruption to bring forth more violent deeds. his eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field, part arable and tilth, whereon were sheaves new reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds; ith' midst an altar as the land-mark stood rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon a sweatie reaper from his tillage brought first fruits, the green eare, and the yellow sheaf, uncull'd, as came to hand; a shepherd next more meek came with the firstlings of his flock choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid the inwards and thir fat, with incense strew'd, on the cleft wood, and all due rites perform'd. his offring soon propitious fire from heav'n consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame; the others not, for his was not sincere; whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd, smote him into the midriff with a stone that beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale groand out his soul with gushing bloud effus'd. much at that sight was adam in his heart dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' angel cri'd. o teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n to that meek man, who well had sacrific'd; is pietie thus and pure devotion paid? t' whom michael thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd. these two are brethren, adam, and to come out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain, for envie that his brothers offering found from heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie fact will be aveng'd, and th' others faith approv'd loose no reward, though here thou see him die, rowling in dust and gore. to which our sire. alas, both for the deed and for the cause! but have i now seen death? is this the way i must return to native dust? o sight of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, horrid to think, how horrible to feel! to whom thus michael. death thou hast seen in his first shape on man; but many shapes of death, and many are the wayes that lead to his grim cave, all dismal; yet to sense more terrible at th' entrance then within. some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die, by fire, flood, famin, by intemperance more in meats and drinks which on the earth shall bring diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know what miserie th' inabstinence of eve shall bring on men. immediately a place before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark, a lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies of gastly spasm, or racking torture, qualmes of heart-sick agonie, all feavorous kinds, convulsions, epilepsies, fierce catarrhs, intestin stone and ulcer, colic pangs, daemoniac phrenzie, moaping melancholie and moon-struck madness, pining atrophie, marasmus, and wide-wasting pestilence, dropsies, and asthma's, and joint-racking rheums. dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair tended the sick busiest from couch to couch; and over them triumphant death his dart shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't with vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. sight so deform what heart of rock could long drie-ey'd behold? adam could not, but wept, though not of woman born; compassion quell'd his best of man, and gave him up to tears a space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess, and scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd. o miserable mankind, to what fall degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd! better end heer unborn. why is life giv'n to be thus wrested from us? rather why obtruded on us thus? who if we knew what we receive, would either not accept life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down, glad to be so dismist in peace. can thus th' image of god in man created once so goodly and erect, though faultie since, to such unsightly sufferings be debas't under inhuman pains? why should not man, retaining still divine similitude in part, from such deformities be free, and for his makers image sake exempt? thir makers image, answerd michael, then forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd to serve ungovern'd appetite, and took his image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice, inductive mainly to the sin of eve. therefore so abject is thir punishment, disfiguring not gods likeness, but thir own, or if his likeness, by themselves defac't while they pervert pure natures healthful rules to loathsom sickness, worthily, since they gods image did not reverence in themselves. i yield it just, said adam, and submit. but is there yet no other way, besides these painful passages, how we may come to death, and mix with our connatural dust; there is, said michael, if thou well observe the rule of not too much, by temperance taught in what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, till many years over thy head return: so maist thou live, till like ripe fruit thou drop into thy mothers lap, or be with ease gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature: this is old age; but then thou must outlive thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change to witherd weak and gray; thy senses then obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe, to what thou hast, and for the aire of youth hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne a melancholy damp of cold and dry to weigh thy spirits down, and last consume the balme of life. to whom our ancestor. henceforth i flie not death, nor would prolong life much, bent rather how i may be quit fairest and easiest of this combrous charge, which i must keep till my appointed day of rendring up, and patiently attend my dissolution. michael repli'd. nor love thy life, nor hate; but what thou livst live well, how long or short permit to heav'n: and now prepare thee for another sight. he lookd and saw a spacious plaine, whereon were tents of various hue; by some were herds of cattel grazing: others, whence the sound of instruments that made melodious chime was heard, of harp and organ; and who moovd thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch instinct through all proportions low and high fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue. in other part stood one who at the forge labouring, two massie clods of iron and brass had melted (whether found where casual fire had wasted woods on mountain or in vale, down to the veins of earth, thence gliding hot to som caves mouth, or whether washt by stream from underground) the liquid ore he dreind into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd first his own tooles; then, what might else be wrought fusil or grav'n in mettle. after these, but on the hether side a different sort from the high neighbouring hills, which was thir seat, down to the plain descended: by thir guise just men they seemd, and all thir study bent to worship god aright, and know his works not hid, nor those things last which might preserve freedom and peace to men: they on the plain long had not walkt, when from the tents behold a beavie of fair women, richly gay in gems and wanton dress; to the harp they sung soft amorous ditties, and in dance came on: the men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes rove without rein, till in the amorous net fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose; and now of love they treat till th' eevning star loves harbinger appeerd; then all in heat they light the nuptial torch, and bid invoke hymen, then first to marriage rites invok't; with feast and musick all the tents resound. such happy interview and fair event of love and youth not lost, songs, garlands, flours, and charming symphonies attach'd the heart of adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight, the bent of nature; which he thus express'd. true opener of mine eyes, prime angel blest, much better seems this vision, and more hope of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, here nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. to whom thus michael. judg not what is best by pleasure, though to nature seeming meet, created, as thou art, to nobler end holie and pure, conformitie divine. those tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the tents of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his race who slew his brother; studious they appere of arts that polish life, inventers rare, unmindful of thir maker, though his spirit taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none. yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget; for that fair femal troop thou sawst, that seemd of goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, yet empty of all good wherein consists womans domestic honour and chief praise; bred onely and completed to the taste of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance, to dress, and troule the tongue, and roule the eye. to these that sober race of men, whose lives religious titl'd them the sons of god, shall yield up all thir vertue, all thir fame ignobly, to the traines and to the smiles of these fair atheists, and now swim in joy, (erelong to swim at large) and laugh; for which the world erelong a world of tears must weepe. to whom thus adam of short joy bereft. o pittie and shame, that they who to live well enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! but still i see the tenor of mans woe holds on the same, from woman to begin. from mans effeminate slackness it begins, said th' angel, who should better hold his place by wisdome, and superiour gifts receav'd. but now prepare thee for another scene. he lookd and saw wide territorie spred before him, towns, and rural works between, cities of men with lofty gates and towrs, concours in arms, fierce faces threatning warr, giants of mightie bone, and bould emprise; part wield thir arms, part courb the foaming steed, single or in array of battel rang'd both horse and foot, nor idely mustring stood; one way a band select from forage drives a herd of beeves, faire oxen and faire kine from a fat meddow ground; or fleecy flock, ewes and thir bleating lambs over the plaine, thir bootie; scarce with life the shepherds flye, but call in aide, which makes a bloody fray; with cruel tournament the squadrons joine; where cattle pastur'd late, now scatterd lies with carcasses and arms th' ensanguind field deserted: others to a citie strong lay seige, encampt; by batterie, scale, and mine, assaulting; others from the wall defend with dart and jav'lin, stones and sulfurous fire; on each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. in other part the scepter'd haralds call to council in the citie gates: anon grey-headed men and grave, with warriours mixt, assemble, and harangues are heard, but soon in factious opposition, till at last of middle age one rising, eminent in wise deport, spake much of right and wrong, of justice, of religion, truth and peace, and judgment from above: him old and young exploded and had seiz'd with violent hands, had not a cloud descending snatch'd him thence unseen amid the throng: so violence proceeded, and oppression, and sword-law through all the plain, and refuge none was found. adam was all in tears, and to his guide lamenting turnd full sad; o what are these, deaths ministers, not men, who thus deal death inhumanly to men, and multiply ten thousandfould the sin of him who slew his brother; for of whom such massacher make they but of thir brethren, men of men? but who was that just man, whom had not heav'n rescu'd, had in his righteousness bin lost? to whom thus michael. these are the product of those ill mated marriages thou saw'st; where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt, produce prodigious births of bodie or mind. such were these giants, men of high renown; for in those dayes might onely shall be admir'd, and valour and heroic vertu call'd; to overcome in battle, and subdue nations, and bring home spoils with infinite man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch of human glorie, and for glorie done of triumph, to be styl'd great conquerours, patrons of mankind, gods, and sons of gods, destroyers rightlier call'd and plagues of men. thus fame shall be atchiev'd, renown on earth, and what most merits fame in silence hid. but hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst the onely righteous in a world perverse, and therefore hated, therefore so beset with foes for daring single to be just, and utter odious truth, that god would come to judge them with his saints: him the most high rapt in a balmie cloud with winged steeds did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with god high in salvation and the climes of bliss, exempt from death; to shew thee what reward awaits the good, the rest what punishment; which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. he look'd, and saw the face of things quite chang'd, the brazen throat of warr had ceast to roar, all now was turn'd to jollitie and game, to luxurie and riot, feast and dance, marrying or prostituting, as befell, rape or adulterie, where passing faire allurd them; thence from cups to civil broiles. at length a reverend sire among them came, and of thir doings great dislike declar'd, and testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft frequented thir assemblies, whereso met, triumphs or festivals, and to them preachd conversion and repentance, as to souls in prison under judgements imminent: but all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd contending, and remov'd his tents farr off; then from the mountain hewing timber tall, began to build a vessel of huge bulk, measur'd by cubit, length, and breadth, and highth, smeard round with pitch, and in the side a dore contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large for man and beast: when loe a wonder strange! of every beast, and bird, and insect small came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught thir order: last the sire, and his three sons with thir four wives; and god made fast the dore. meanwhile the southwind rose, and with black wings wide hovering, all the clouds together drove from under heav'n; the hills to their supplie vapour, and exhalation dusk and moist, sent up amain; and now the thick'nd skie like a dark ceeling stood; down rush'd the rain impetuous, and continu'd till the earth no more was seen; the floating vessel swum uplifted; and secure with beaked prow rode tilting o're the waves, all dwellings else flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp deep under water rould; sea cover'd sea, sea without shoar; and in thir palaces where luxurie late reign'd, sea-monsters whelp'd and stabl'd; of mankind, so numerous late, all left, in one small bottom swum imbark't. how didst thou grieve then, adam, to behold the end of all thy ofspring, end so sad, depopulation; thee another floud, of tears and sorrow a floud thee also drown'd, and sunk thee as thy sons; till gently reard by th' angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last, though comfortless, as when a father mourns his children, all in view destroyd at once; and scarce to th' angel utterdst thus thy plaint. o visions ill foreseen! better had i liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne my part of evil onely, each dayes lot anough to beare; those now, that were dispenst the burd'n of many ages, on me light at once, by my foreknowledge gaining birth abortive, to torment me ere thir being, with thought that they must be. let no man seek henceforth to be foretold what shall befall him or his childern, evil he may be sure, which neither his foreknowing can prevent, and hee the future evil shall no less in apprehension then in substance feel grievous to bear: but that care now is past, man is not whom to warne: those few escap't famin and anguish will at last consume wandring that watrie desert: i had hope when violence was ceas't, and warr on earth, all would have then gon well, peace would have crownd with length of happy dayes the race of man; but i was farr deceav'd; for now i see peace to corrupt no less then warr to waste. how comes it thus? unfould, celestial guide, and whether here the race of man will end. to whom thus michael. those whom last thou sawst in triumph and luxurious wealth, are they first seen in acts of prowess eminent and great exploits, but of true vertu void; who having spilt much blood, and don much waste subduing nations, and achievd thereby fame in the world, high titles, and rich prey, shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride raise out of friendship hostil deeds in peace. the conquerd also, and enslav'd by warr shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose and fear of god, from whom thir pietie feign'd in sharp contest of battel found no aide against invaders; therefore coold in zeale thenceforth shall practice how to live secure, worldlie or dissolute, on what thir lords shall leave them to enjoy; for th' earth shall bear more then anough, that temperance may be tri'd: so all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd, justice and temperance, truth and faith forgot; one man except, the onely son of light in a dark age, against example good, against allurement, custom, and a world offended; fearless of reproach and scorn, or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes shall them admonish, and before them set the paths of righteousness, how much more safe, and full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come on thir impenitence; and shall returne of them derided, but of god observd the one just man alive; by his command shall build a wondrous ark, as thou beheldst, to save himself and household from amidst a world devote to universal rack. no sooner hee with them of man and beast select for life shall in the ark be lodg'd, and shelterd round, but all the cataracts of heav'n set open on the earth shall powre raine day and night, all fountains of the deep broke up, shall heave the ocean to usurp beyond all bounds, till inundation rise above the highest hills: then shall this mount of paradise by might of waves be moovd out of his place, pushd by the horned floud, with all his verdure spoil'd, and trees adrift down the great river to the op'ning gulf, and there take root an iland salt and bare, the haunt of seales and orcs, and sea-mews clang. to teach thee that god attributes to place no sanctitie, if none be thither brought by men who there frequent, or therein dwell. and now what further shall ensue, behold. he lookd, and saw the ark hull on the floud, which now abated, for the clouds were fled, drivn by a keen north-winde, that blowing drie wrinkl'd the face of deluge, as decai'd; and the cleer sun on his wide watrie glass gaz'd hot, and of the fresh wave largely drew, as after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink from standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole with soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt his sluces, as the heav'n his windows shut. the ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground fast on the top of som high mountain fixt. and now the tops of hills as rocks appeer; with clamor thence the rapid currents drive towards the retreating sea thir furious tyde. forthwith from out the arke a raven flies, and after him, the surer messenger, a dove sent forth once and agen to spie green tree or ground whereon his foot may light; the second time returning, in his bill an olive leafe he brings, pacific signe: anon drie ground appeers, and from his arke the ancient sire descends with all his train; then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout, grateful to heav'n, over his head beholds a dewie cloud, and in the cloud a bow conspicuous with three listed colours gay, betok'ning peace from god, and cov'nant new. whereat the heart of adam erst so sad greatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke forth. o thou who future things canst represent as present, heav'nly instructer, i revive at this last sight, assur'd that man shall live with all the creatures, and thir seed preserve. farr less i now lament for one whole world of wicked sons destroyd, then i rejoyce for one man found so perfet and so just, that god voutsafes to raise another world from him, and all his anger to forget. but say, what mean those colourd streaks in heavn, distended as the brow of god appeas'd, or serve they as a flourie verge to binde the fluid skirts of that same watrie cloud, least it again dissolve and showr the earth? to whom th' archangel. dextrously thou aim'st; so willingly doth god remit his ire, though late repenting him of man deprav'd, griev'd at his heart, when looking down he saw the whole earth fill'd with violence, and all flesh corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov'd, such grace shall one just man find in his sight, that he relents, not to blot out mankind, and makes a covenant never to destroy the earth again by flood, nor let the sea surpass his bounds, nor rain to drown the world with man therein or beast; but when he brings over the earth a cloud, will therein set his triple-colour'd bow, whereon to look and call to mind his cov'nant: day and night, seed time and harvest, heat and hoary frost shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new, both heav'n and earth, wherein the just shall dwell. <line>","religion,christianity,god & the divine"

9943,12027,"<line> <line>words can bang around in your head forever, if you let them and you give them room. i used to love poetry, and mostly i still do, though sometimes “i, too, dislike it.” there must be something real beyond the fiddle and perfunctoryconsolations and the quarrels—as of coursethere is, though what it is is difficult to say.the salt is on the briar rose, the fog is in the fir trees.i didn’t know what it was, and i don’t know now,but it was what i started out to do, and now, a lifetime later, all i’ve really done. the opening of the field, roots and branches, rivers and mountains: i sat in my roomalone, their fragments shored against the ruin or revelationthat was sure to come, breathing in their secret atmosphere,repeating them until they almost seemed my own.we like to think our lives are what they study to become,and yet so much of life is waiting, waiting on a whim.so much of what we are is sheer coincidence,like a sentence whose significance is retrospective,made up out of elementary particles that are in some sensesimply sounds, like syllables that finally settle into place.you probably think that this is a poem about poetry (and obviously it is), yet its real subject is time, for that’s what poetry is—a way to live through time and sometimes, just for a while, to bring it back. <line> <line> <line> <line>* * * <line> <line>a paneled dining room in holder hall. stage right, enter twit:“mr. ashbery, i’m your biggest campus fan.” we hit it offand talked about “the skaters” and my preference for “clepsydra” vs. “fragment.” later on that night john asked me to a party in new york, and saturday, after dinner and a panel on the artist’s role as something (and a party), driving lewis’s austin-healey through the rain i sealed our friendship with an accident. the party was on broadway,an apartment (white of course, with paintings) just downstairsfrom frank o’hara’s, who finally wandered down. i talked to hima little about love poems (tentative title), which pleased him,and quoted a line from “poem” about the rain, which seemed to please him too.the party ended, john and i went off to max’s, ordered steaks and talked about our mothers. all that talking!—poems and paintings,parents, all those parties, and the age of manifestos still to come!i started coming to new york for lunch. we’d meet at art news,walk to fifty-sixth street to larre’s, a restaurant filled with french expatriates,have martinis and the prix fixe for $2.50 (!), drink rose de provenceand talk (of course) about genet and james and words like “coca-cola.”it was an afternoon in may when john brought up a playthat he and kenneth koch and frank o’hara—holy trinity!(batman was in vogue)—had started years ago and never finished.there was a dictator named edgar and some penicillin,but that’s all i remember. they hadn’t actually been togetherin years, but planned to finish it that night at john’s new apartmenton ninety-fifth street, and he said to come by for a drinkbefore they ate and got to work. it was a new york dreamcome true: a brownstone floor-through, white and full of paintings(naturally), “with a good library and record collection.”john had procured a huge steak, and as i helped him set the tablethe doorbell rang and frank o’hara, fresh from the museumand svelte in a hound’s tooth sports coat entered, followed shortlyby “excitement-prone kenneth koch” in somber gray,and i was one with my immortals. in the small mythologieswe make up out of memories and the flow of timea few moments remain frozen, though the feel of them is lost,the feel of talk. it ranged from puns to gossip, always coming back to poems and poets. frank was fiercely loyal to young poets(joe ceravolo’s name came up i think), and when i mentioned lewisin a way that must have sounded catty, he leapt to his defense,leaving me to backtrack in embarrassment and have another drink,which is what everyone had. i think you see where it was going:conversation drifting into dinner, then i stayed for dinnerand everyone forgot about the play, which was never finished(though i think i’ve seen a fragment of it somewhere). i see a tablein a cone of light, but there’s no sound except for kenneth’s deadpan “love to see a boy eat” as i speared a piece of steak;and then the only voice i’m sure i hear is mine,as those moments that had once seemed singular and cleardissolve into a “general mess of imprecision of feeling”and images, augmented by line breaks. there were phone calls,other people arrived, the narrative of the night dissolvedand finally everyone went home. school and spring wound down.the semester ended, then the weekend that i wrote about in “sally’s hair”arrived and went, and then a late-night cruise around manhattan for a rich friend’sparents’ anniversary bash, followed by an upper east side preppie barthat left me looking for a place to crash, and so i rang john’s bell at 2 amand failed (thank god) to rouse him, caught a plane to san diegothe next day, worked at my summer job and worked on poemsand started reading proust, and got a card one afternoonfrom peter schjeldahl telling me that frank o’hara had been killed.ninety-fifth street soldiered on for several years.i remember a cocktail party (the symposium of those days),followed by dinner just around the corner at elaine’s,pre-woody allen. it was there i learned of r.f.k.’s assassinationwhen i woke up on the daybed in the living room, and wherejohn told me getting married would ruin me as a poet(i don’t know why—most of his friends were married), a judgmenthe revised when he met susan and inscribed the double dream of spring“if this is all we need fear from spinach, then i don’t mind so much”(which was probably premature—watering his plants one dayshe soaked his landlord, giorgio cavallon, dozing in the garden below).it was where peter delacorte late one night recited an entire sideof a firesign theatre album from memory, and set john on that path,to his friends’ subsequent dismay, and where he blessed me with his extra copyof the poems, and next day had second thoughts (though i kept it anyway). sometimes a vague, amorphous stretch of years assumes a shape,and then becomes an age, and then a golden age alive with possibilities,when change was in the air and you could wander through its streetsas though through florence and the renaissance. i know it sounds ridiculous,but that’s the way life flows: in stages that take form in retrospect,when all the momentary things that occupy the mind from day to dayhave vanished into time, and something takes their place that wasn’t there,a sense of freedom—one which gradually slipped away. the centerof the conversation moved downtown, the renaissance gave way to mannerismas the junior faculty took charge, leaving the emeriti alone and out of itof course, lying on the fringes, happily awake; but for the rest the laws proscribing what you couldn’t do were clear. i got so tiredof writing all those new york poems (though by then i’d moved to boston—to siena, you might say) that led to nowhere but the next one,so i started writing poems about whatever moved me: what it’s liketo be alive within a world that holds no place for you, yet seems so beautiful;the feeling of the future, and its disappointments; the trajectory of a life,that always brought me back to time and memory (i’d finished proust by then),and brings me back to this. john finally moved downtown himself,into a two-story apartment at twenty-fifth and tenth, with a spiral staircase leading to a library, the locus of the incident of susan, alydar and john and the pitcher of water (i’ll draw a veil over it), and jimmy schuyler sighing“it’s so beautiful,” as bernadette peters sang “raining in my heart” from dames at sea.the poetry still continued—mine and everyone’s. i’d added jimmy to my pantheon (as you’ve probably noticed), but the night in nineteen sixty-six seemed more and more remote: i never saw kenneth anymore,and there were new epicenters, with new casts of characters, like madoo, bob dash’s garden in sagaponack, and bill and willy’s loft in soho.john moved again, to twenty-second street, and susan and i moved to milwaukee,where our son was born. i stopped coming to new york, and writing poems, for several years, while i tried to dream enough philosophy for tenure.one afternoon in may i found myself at ninth and twenty-second,and as though on cue two people whom i hadn’t seen in years—david kalstone, darragh park—just happened by, and then i took a taxi down to sohoto the loft, and then a gallery to hear joe brainard read from i remember,back to john’s and out to dinner—as though i’d never been away, though it was all too clear i had. poems were in the air, but theory too, and members of the thought police department (who must have also gotten tenure) turned up everywhere, with arguments that poetry was called upon to prove.it mattered, but in a different way, as though it floated free from poemsand wasn’t quite the point. i kept on coming back, as i still do.half my life was still to come, and yet the rest was mostly personal:i got divorced, and willy killed himself, and here i am now, ready to retire.there was an obituary in the times last week for michael goldberg,a painter you’ll recall from frank o’hara’s poems (“why i am not a painter,”“ode to michael goldberg (’s birth and other births)”). i didn’t know him,but a few months after the soiree on ninety-fifth street i was at a partyin his studio on the bowery, which was still his studio when he died.the new york art world demimonde was there, including nearly everyonewho’s turned up in this poem. i remember staring at a guy wholooked like something from the black lagoon, dancing with a gorgeouswoman half his age. that’s my new york: an island dreamof personalities and evenings, nights where poetry was second natureand their lives flowed through it and around it as it gave them life.o brave new world (now old) that had such people in’t! <line> <line>* * * <line> <line>“the tiresome old man is telling us his life story.” i guess i am, but that’s what poets do—not always quite as obviously as this, and usually more by indirectionand omission, but beneath the poetry lies the singular reality and unreality of an individual life. i see it as a long,illuminated tunnel, lined with windows giving on the scenes outside—on ninety-fifth street forty years ago. as life goes onyou start to get increasingly distracted by your own reflectionand the darkness gradually becoming visible at the end. i try not to look too far ahead, but just to stay here— quick now, here, now, always—only something pulls meback (as they say) to the day, when poems were more like secrets,with their own vernacular, and you could tell your friends by who and what they read. and now john’s practically become a national treasure, and whenever i look up i think i see him floating in the sky like the cheshire cat. i don’t knowwhat to make of it, but it makes me happy—like seeing kenneth just before he died (“i’m going west john, i’m going west”) in his apartment on a side street near columbia, or rememberingonce again that warm spring night in nineteen sixty-six. i like to think of them together once again, at the cocktail partyat the end of the mind, where i could blunder in and ruin it one last time.meanwhile, on a hillside in the driftless region to the west,a few miles from the small town where the straight story ends,i’m building a house on a meadow, if i’m permitted to return,behind a screen of trees above a lower meadow, with some apple treesin which the fog collects on autumn afternoons, and a vistaof an upland pasture without heaviness. i see myselfsitting on the deck and sipping a martini, as i used to at larre’s, in a future that feels almost like a past i’m positive is there— but where? i think my life is still all conversation,only now it’s with myself. i can see it continuing forever,even in my absence, as i close the windows and turn off the lightsand it begins to rain. and then we’re there together in the house on the meadow, waiting for whatever’s left to comein what’s become the near future—two versions of myself and of the people that we knew, each one an otherto the other, yet both indelibly there: the twit of twentyand the aging child of sixty-two, still separateand searching in the night, listening through the nightto the noise of the rain and memories of rainand evenings when we’d wander out into the renaissance,when i could see you and talk to you and it could still change;and still there in the morning when the rain has stopped,and the apples are all getting tinted in the cool light.

the cross was still and shimmered <line> <line>as if it held its breath so as to observe him. <line> <line>he was trembling, he saw the ghostly limbs <line> <line>behind the bright-dim curtain, those long wired veins <line> <line>through which pulse flickered and the wine flowed, <line> <line>the chest breathed with almost no sound at all. <line> <line>this figure had nothing to do with the gods who brought him, <line> <line>tugged at his heart, took their leave when most he needed. <line> <line>this looked like the son of the god he had sought to elude, <line> <line>now a giant surveying a world and a singular man <line> <line>abandoned by everything he'd served, but nonetheless <line> <line>dancing and shivering above the scrum of waves. <line> <line>cities had grown on the mainland meanwhile, monks and priors, <line> <line>grew fat;

he must have had a father and a mother — in fact i've heard him say so — and a dog, as a boy should, i venture; and the dog, most likely, was the only man who knew him. a dog, for all i know, is what he needs as much as anything right here to-day, to counsel him about his disillusions, old aches, and parturitions of what's coming, — a dog of orders, an emeritus, to wag his tail at him when he comes home, and then to put his paws up on his knees and say, ""for god's sake, what's it all about?"" i don't know whether he needs a dog or not — or what he needs. i tell him he needs greek; i'll talk of rules and aristotle with him, and if his tongue's at home he'll say to that, i have your word that aristotle knows, and you mine that i don't know aristotle."" he's all at odds with all the unities, and what's yet worse, it doesn't seem to matter; he treads along through time's old wilderness as if the tramp of all the centuries had left no roads — and there are none, for him; he doesn't see them, even with those eyes, — and that's a pity, or i say it is. accordingly we have him as we have him — going his way, the way that he goes best, a pleasant animal with no great noise or nonsense anywhere to set him off — save only divers and inclement devils have made of late his heart their dwelling place. a flame half ready to fly out sometimes at some annoyance may be fanned up in him, but soon it falls, and when it falls goes out; he knows how little room there is in there for crude and futile animosities, and how much for the joy of being whole, and how much for long sorrow and old pain. on our side there are some who may be given to grow old wondering what he thinks of us and some above us, who are, in his eyes, above himself, — and that's quite right and english. yet here we smile, or disappoint the gods who made it so: the gods have always eyes to see men scratch; and they see one down here who itches, manor-bitten to the bone, albeit he knows himself — yes, yes, he knows — the lord of more than england and of more than all the seas of england in all time shall ever wash. d'ye wonder that i laugh? he sees me, and he doesn't seem to care; and why the devil should he? i can't tell you. i'll meet him out alone of a bright sunday, trim, rather spruce, and quite the gentleman. ""what ho, my lord!"" say i. he doesn't hear me; wherefore i have to pause and look at him. he's not enormous, but one looks at him. a little on the round if you insist, for now, god save the mark, he's growing old; he's five and forty, and to hear him talk these days you'd call him eighty; then you'd add more years to that. he's old enough to be the father of a world, and so he is. ""ben, you're a scholar, what's the time of day?"" says he; and there shines out of him again an aged light that has no age or station — the mystery that's his — a mischievous half-mad serenity that laughs at fame for being won so easy, and at friends who laugh at him for what he wants the most, and for his dukedom down in warwickshire; — by which you see we're all a little jealous ... poor greene! i fear the color of his name was even as that of his ascending soul; and he was one where there are many others, — some scrivening to the end against their fate, their puppets all in ink and all to die there; and some with hands that once would shade an eye that scanned euripides and æschylus will reach by this time for a pot-house mop to slush their first and last of royalties. poor devils! and they all play to his hand; for so it was in athens and old rome. but that's not here or there; i've wandered off. greene does it, or i'm careful. where's that boy? yes, he'll go back to stratford. and we'll miss him? dear sir, there'll be no london here without him. we'll all be riding, one of these fine days, down there to see him — and his wife won't like us; and then we'll think of what he never said of women — which, if taken all in all with what he did say, would buy many horses. though nowadays he's not so much for women: ""so few of them,"" he says, ""are worth the guessing."" but there's a worm at work when he says that, and while he says it one feels in the air a deal of circumambient hocus-pocus. they've had him dancing till his toes were tender, and he can feel 'em now, come chilly rains. there's no long cry for going into it, however, and we don't know much about it. but you in stratford, like most here in london, have more now in the sonnets than you paid for; he's put one there with all her poison on, to make a singing fiction of a shadow that's in his life a fact, and always will be. but she's no care of ours, though time, i fear, will have a more reverberant ado about her than about another one who seems to have decoyed him, married him, and sent him scuttling on his way to london, — with much already learned, and more to learn, and more to follow. lord! how i see him now, pretending, maybe trying, to be like us. whatever he may have meant, we never had him; he failed us, or escaped, or what you will, — and there was that about him (god knows what, — we'd flayed another had he tried it on us) that made as many of us as had wits more fond of all his easy distances than one another's noise and clap-your-shoulder. but think you not, my friend, he'd never talk! talk? he was eldritch at it; and we listened — thereby acquiring much we knew before about ourselves, and hitherto had held irrelevant, or not prime to the purpose. and there were some, of course, and there be now, disordered and reduced amazedly to resignation by the mystic seal of young finality the gods had laid on everything that made him a young demon; and one or two shot looks at him already as he had been their executioner; and once or twice he was, not knowing it, — or knowing, being sorry for poor clay and saying nothing ... yet, for all his engines, you'll meet a thousand of an afternoon who strut and sun themselves and see around 'em a world made out of more that has a reason than his, i swear, that he sees here to-day; though he may scarcely give a fool an exit but we mark how he sees in everything a law that, given we flout it once too often, brings fire and iron down on our naked heads. to me it looks as if the power that made him, for fear of giving all things to one creature, left out the first, — faith, innocence, illusion, whatever 'tis that keeps us out o' bedlam, — and thereby, for his too consuming vision, empowered him out of nature; though to see him, you'd never guess what's going on inside him. he'll break out some day like a keg of ale with too much independent frenzy in it; and all for collaring what he knows won't keep, and what he'd best forget — but that he can't. you'll have it, and have more than i'm foretelling; and there'll be such a roaring at the globe as never stunned the bleeding gladiators. he'll have to change the color of its hair a bit, for now he calls it cleopatra. black hair would never do for cleopatra. but you and i are not yet two old women, and you're a man of office. what he does is more to you than how it is he does it, — and that's what the lord god has never told him. they work together, and the devil helps 'em; they do it of a morning, or if not, they do it of a night; in which event he's peevish of a morning. he seems old; he's not the proper stomach or the sleep — and they're two sovran agents to conserve him against the fiery art that has no mercy but what's in that prodigious grand new house. i gather something happening in his boyhood fulfilled him with a boy's determination to make all stratford 'ware of him. well, well, i hope at last he'll have his joy of it, and all his pigs and sheep and bellowing beeves, and frogs and owls and unicorns, moreover, be less than hell to his attendant ears. oh, past a doubt we'll all go down to see him. he may be wise. with london two days off, down there some wind of heaven may yet revive him; but there's no quickening breath from anywhere small make of him again the poised young faun from warwickshire, who'd made, it seems, already a legend of himself before i came to blink before the last of his first lightning. whatever there be, there'll be no more of that; the coming on of his old monster time has made him a still man; and he has dreams were fair to think on once, and all found hollow. he knows how much of what men paint themselves would blister in the light of what they are; he sees how much of what was great now shares an eminence transformed and ordinary; he knows too much of what the world has hushed in others, to be loud now for himself; he knows now at what height low enemies may reach his heart, and high friends let him fall; but what not even such as he may know bedevils him the worst: his lark may sing at heaven's gate how he will, and for as long as joy may listen, but he sees no gate, save one whereat the spent clay waits a little before the churchyard has it, and the worm. not long ago, late in an afternoon, i came on him unseen down lambeth way, and on my life i was afear'd of him: he gloomed and mumbled like a soul from tophet, his hands behind him and his head bent solemn. ""what is it now,"" said i, — ""another woman?"" that made him sorry for me, and he smiled. ""no, ben,"" he mused; ""it's nothing. it's all nothing. we come, we go; and when we're done, we're done."" spiders and flies — we're mostly one or t'other — we come, we go; and when we're done, we're done; ""by god, you sing that song as if you knew it!"" said i, by way of cheering him; ""what ails ye?"" ""i think i must have come down here to think,"" says he to that, and pulls his little beard; ""your fly will serve as well as anybody, and what's his hour? he flies, and flies, and flies, and in his fly's mind has a brave appearance; and then your spider gets him in her net, and eats him out, and hangs him up to dry. that's nature, the kind mother of us all. and then your slattern housemaid swings her broom, and where's your spider? and that's nature, also. it's nature, and it's nothing. it's all nothing. it's all a world where bugs and emperors go singularly back to the same dust, each in his time; and the old, ordered stars that sang together, ben, will sing the same old stave to-morrow."" when he talks like that, there's nothing for a human man to do but lead him to some grateful nook like this where we be now, and there to make him drink. he'll drink, for love of me, and then be sick; a sad sign always in a man of parts, and always very ominous. the great should be as large in liquor as in love, — and our great friend is not so large in either: one disaffects him, and the other fails him; whatso he drinks that has an antic in it, he's wondering what's to pay in his insides; and while his eyes are on the cyprian he's fribbling all the time with that damned house. we laugh here at his thrift, but after all it may be thrift that saves him from the devil; god gave it, anyhow, — and we'll suppose he knew the compound of his handiwork. to-day the clouds are with him, but anon he'll out of 'em enough to shake the tree of life itself and bring down fruit unheard-of, — and, throwing in the bruised and whole together, prepare a wine to make us drunk with wonder; and if he live, there'll be a sunset spell thrown over him as over a glassed lake that yesterday was all a black wild water. god send he live to give us, if no more, what now's a-rampage in him, and exhibit, with a decent half-allegiance to the ages an earnest of at least a casual eye turned once on what he owes to gutenberg, and to the fealty of more centuries than are as yet a picture in our vision. ""there's time enough, — i'll do it when i'm old, and we're immortal men,"" he says to that; and then he says to me, ""ben, what's 'immortal'? think you by any force of ordination it may be nothing of a sort more noisy than a small oblivion of component ashes that of a dream-addicted world was once a moving atomy much like your friend here?"" nothing will help that man. to make him laugh, i said then he was a mad mountebank, — and by the lord i nearer made him cry. i could have eat an eft then, on my knees, tail, claws, and all of him; for i had stung the king of men, who had no sting for me, and i had hurt him in his memories; and i say now, as i shall say again, i love the man this side idolatry. he'll do it when he's old, he says. i wonder. he may not be so ancient as all that. for such as he, the thing that is to do will do itself, — but there's a reckoning; the sessions that are now too much his own, the roiling inward of a stilled outside, the churning out of all those blood-fed lines, the nights of many schemes and little sleep, the full brain hammered hot with too much thinking, the vexed heart over-worn with too much aching, — this weary jangling of conjoined affairs made out of elements that have no end, and all confused at once, i understand, is not what makes a man to live forever. o no, not now! he'll not be going now: there'll be time yet for god knows what explosions before he goes. he'll stay awhile. just wait: just wait a year or two for cleopatra, for she's to be a balsam and a comfort; and that's not all a jape of mine now, either. for granted once the old way of apollo sings in a man, he may then, if he's able, strike unafraid whatever strings he will upon the last and wildest of new lyres; nor out of his new magic, though it hymn the shrieks of dungeoned hell, shall he create a madness or a gloom to shut quite out a cleaving daylight, and a last great calm triumphant over shipwreck and all storms. he might have given aristotle creeps, but surely would have given him his katharsis. he'll not be going yet. there's too much yet unsung within the man. but when he goes, i'd stake ye coin o' the realm his only care for a phantom world he sounded and found wanting will be a portion here, a portion there, of this or that thing or some other thing that has a patent and intrinsical equivalence in those egregious shillings. and yet he knows, god help him! tell me, now, if ever there was anything let loose on earth by gods or devils heretofore like this mad, careful, proud, indifferent shakespeare! where was it, if it ever was? by heaven, 'twas never yet in rhodes or pergamon — in thebes or nineveh, a thing like this! no thing like this was ever out of england; and that he knows. i wonder if he cares. perhaps he does .... o lord, that house in stratford! <line>","arts & sciences,poetry & poets,social commentaries,cities & urban life,mythology & folklore,heroes & patriotism"

the prince god loves!” see teucer’s bow. hear teucer’s: “this time lucky.” his— but this time it was not our father, god, who saved your life, my prince. as agamemnon cried: “the ships are safe. stand at the riverside’s far bank.” teléspiax heard the rustle of lord teucer’s shot and stood between yourself and it. his head was opened, egglike, at the back, mucked with thick blood, blood trickling from his mouth. his last words were: “prince, your trumpeter has lost his breath.” “our worst fear was his face would fade,” teléspiax’s father said. “but it did not. we will remember it until we die.” “give his instrument to hogem,” hector said, and went— lutie on reins—between the sea and snow, throwing his chariots wide, scamánderwards, as easily as others might a cloak. diomed among this traffic, on his own, among his dead, their pools of blood, their cut-off body-parts, their cut-off heads, ashamed as his head cleared to see odysseus, idomeneo, the ajax—big and small— whipping away downslope, shouting towards odysseus: “where are you going with your back to the battle?” who shouted back, although he did not turn: “look left!” and there was lutie driving hector onto him, sure they would trample him, for sure queen hera’s human, diomed, would stand and die, except: “arms up, young king—” nestor, full tilt, reins round his tummy, leaning out “—and jump . . .” wrists locked “. . . you young are just . . .” swinging him up onto the plate “. . . too much.” “with your permission, da?” nod. drew. then threw the chariot’s javelin as lutie spun his wheels, and hector threw— those skewers trading brilliance as they passed— and missed—both vehicles slither-straightening, regaining speed, close, close, then driven apart by empty cars careering off the incline, or stationary cars, their horses cropping grass. “daddy, go slow. hector will say i ran.” “but not the widows you have made.” and slow and low cruising the blue above this mix heaven’s queen and ringsight-eyed athena trumpeting down huge worms of sound as hector’s car rereached king nestor’s, and: “what kept you, prince?” diomed offered as they came abreast: “you went for a refreshing towel?” and threw his axe, that toppled through the air, and, oh, hector, my hector, as you thought: “if heaven helps me heaven shows it loves the best,” parted your lutie’s mesh and smashed into his heart. what did you say as god called you to death dear lutie? “king prince, i leave you driverless.” and put the reins into his hands, and fled into oblivion as hector with his other hand held what his lutie was, upright, face forwards, in between the chariot’s basket and himself, shouting as he drove after them: “loathsome greek, your loathsome hair, your loathsome blood, your loathsome breath, your loathsome heart, jump in your loathsome ships, i will come after you, come over the aegean after you, and find you though you hide inside your loathsome father’s grave and with my bare hands twist your loathsome head off your loathsome neck.” there was a greek called themion. mad about armour. if not armour, cars. of course he went to troy. and troy saw a stray spear transfix him as he drove. companionably, his horses galloped up on starlight’s side, and muddled starlight down, and bertie down, and brought the prince (still holding lutie) down, as all the world hurried, as if by windheads, on towards scamánder’s ford. hether you reach it from the palisade or through the trees that dot the incline’s last stretch you hear scamánder’s voice before you see what one may talk across on quiet days its rippling sunspangled breadth streaming across the bars of pebbly sand that form its ford —though on the fleet’s side deeper, darkly bright. and here tiptoeing from this bar to that, settling the cloudy sunshine of her hair, her towel retained by nothing save herself, the god of tops and thongs our lady aphrodité came, her eyes brimfull with tears. scamánder is astonished by his luck. “beauty of beauties, why are you weeping?” “i have been hurt, scamánder.” “no . . .” “humiliated.” “no . . .” “me. a god. just like yourself. touched . . .” “touched!” “by a man.” “a man!” “a greek.” “death to all greeks!” “he cut me!” “sacrilege! . . . but where?” “i need your healing touch.” “how can i help you if you do not show me where?” “moisten its lips and my wound will be healed.” “you must say where!” “well . . .” the towel has slipped an inch. “i am afraid you will be disappointed.” “never.” “are you sure?” “yes!” “you will not criticize me?” “no!” her wrist upturned. out-turned. her opened palm. fanning the fingers of her other hand, stroking his spangles with her fingertips. “goddess, i love you. i have always loved you. say that you love me. even a little. i beg you. god grant it.” “i need your help, scamánder.” “take pity on me. come into me.” “you have your nymphs.” “bores! bores!” “i might be nibbled by an eel!” “death to all eels!” the towel is down. “step into me . . . i love your toes . . . please let me kiss your toes . . . your little dinkum-inkum toes . . .” “no one has kissed them so nicely, scamánder.” “and now your knees . . .” “you tickle me . . .” “and now your thighs!” “oh, oh, go on . . .” “and now your bum! your holy bum! your sacred bum! the bum of paradise!” “oh, my scamánder, i must have your help . . .” “anything!” the towel goes curling off, and as she floated on his stream our lady aphrodité said: “at any moment now the greeks will reach your troy-side bank . . .” recall those sequences when horsemen ride out of the trees and down into a stream somewhere in kansas or missouri, say. so—save they were thousands—greece into scamánder’s ford. coming downstream, a smallish wave that passes but scamánder’s flow does not relapse. indeed almost without a sound its murmuring radiance rose into a dark, torrential surge, clouded with boulders, crammed with trees, as clamorous as if it were a sea, that lifted greece, then pulled greece down, cars gone, masks gone, gone under, reappearing, gone: “onto your knees! praise hector for this flood! the prince god loves!” prince hector claims as he comes through the trees. they do. then up and run, run, thousands of them, to hold those greeks who got back out under until their bubbles stopped; while those swept off turned somersaults amid scamánder’s undertow. the flat— 1000 yards of it between the river and the palisade. the king: “the lord has not abandoned us. to cross will be as bad for them.” but it was not to be as bad for them. indeed, as hector drove towards scamánder’s brink, and as—their banners rising one by one, one after one and then another one— he and all ilium began to enter it, the river reassumed its softly-spoken, smooth, sunspangled way. and agamemnon cried: “god, what are you for? what use are you to me?” as hector cries: “two miracles! your prince is close to god!” and hera to athena: “fog?” and fog came down. and most of greece got out. troy holding hands midstream. an army peering through its masks. miss tops and thongs to god: “your hera has . . .” and with a wish he turned the fog to light and with a word he called them back to heaven. sky. snow. the 1000 yards. the palisade. hector: “i am your prince. my name means he-who-holds. troy. and the plain. and now the ships. for troy!” his battle cry, rising into a common cry, that cry into a clamour, and that clamour to bayings of hatred. 800 yards. the child: “we are the greeks. we fight to win. if one is lost, close his eyes, step over him, and kill his enemy.” 800 yards. the greeks are tiring. nestor is on his knees: “god of all gods, most holy and most high, if greece has ever sacrificed fresh blood to you, protect our ships.” heaven. soft music. summertime. queen hera and athena? yes . . . some lesser gods observing their approach, approach, salaam, and then lead them— now both in black wraparound tops— to god: “darling daddy, here we are.” “and” (hera) “here we stay until you stop that worthless hector killing greeks.” up steps love. hera: “why is she wearing a tent?” love: “father, see this.” (her wrist.) “human strikes god! communism! the end of everything!” “darlings,” he said, “you know that being a god means being blamed. do this—no good. do that—the same. the answer is: avoid humanity. remember—i am god. i see the bigger picture.” “and i am hera, heaven’s queen, greece worships me.” “stuff greece,” love said. “your blubber-bummed wife with her gobstopper nipples hates troy because troy’s paris put her last when we stripped off for him. as for the ithacan boat-boy’s undercurved preceptatrix, she hates troy because my statue stands on its acropolis.” hera: “the cities’ whores were taxed to pay for it.” love (dropping onto her knees before himself): “please . . . stop them harming troy. the greatest city in the world.” while hera and athena sang: “cleavage! cleavage! queen of the foaming hole. mammoth or man or midge she sucks from pole to pole.” and god has had enough of it. lifting his scales he said: “hector will have his day of victory.” then crashed them to the ground. 700 yards. the palisade. its gate. late sunlight on gilt beaks. “there’s no escape from troy.” “or from the plain at troy.” begging for ransom, trojan hoti, his arms around king menelaos’ knees. king agamemnon: “off.” then he punched hoti in the face. then punched him in the face again. and then again. and when he fell king agamemnon kicked him in the groin. kicking him in the groin with so much force it took a step to follow up each kick. then pulled him up, then dragged him by his hair this way and that, then left him, calling: “finish him off.” and someone did. “i was sixteen. i said: ‘where is achilles?’ hard as it is to share another’s troubles when your own are pressing great ajax took my hands in his and said: ‘he loves us. he is with us. he will come.’” but he did not. then ajax to himself: “dear lord, you made me straight. give me the strength to last till dark.” the prince: “i get past everything i see. their war is lost.” it was. aenéas, ábassee, sarpédon, gray, calling to one another down the line. then, with a mighty wall of sound, as if a slope of stones rolled down into a lake of broken glass we ran at them. and now the light of evening has begun to shawl across the plain: blue gray, gold gray, blue gold, translucent nothingnesses readying our space, within the deep, unchanging sea of space, for hesper’s entrance, and the silver wrap. covered with blood, mostly their own, loyal to death, reckoning to die odysseus, ajax, diomed, idomeneo, nestor, menelaos and the king: “do not die because others have died.” “do not show them the palms of your hands.” “achil!” “achil!” “if he won’t help us, heaven help us.” “stand still and fight.” “feel shame in one another’s eyes.” “i curse you, god. you are a liar, god. troy will be yours by dark—immortal lies.” “home!” “home!” “there’s no such place.” “you can’t launch burning ships.” “more men survive if no one runs.” but that is what greece did. dropping their wounded, throwing down their dead, their shields, their spears, their swords, they ran. leaving their heroes tattered, filthy, torn and ran and ran above their cries: “i am the prince! the victory is mine!” chylábborak: “do not take cowardice for granted.” scarce had he said it, when his son, kykéon, standing next to him took ajax’ final spear cast in his chest. “i shall not wear your armour, sir,” he said. and died. “my son is dead.” the prince: “hector is loved by god.” and greece, a wall of walking swords, but walking backwards, leaving the plain in silence and in tears. idomeneo, running back out at those trojans who came too close: “you know my name. come look for me. and boy, the day you do will be the day you die.” hector to troy: “soldiers!— unmatched my force, unconquerable my will. after ten years of days, in one long day to be remembered for as many days as there are days to come, this is my day, your hector’s day. troy given back to troy. my day of victory!” and when the cheering died: “some say: destroy greece now. but i say no. out of your cars. eat by your fires. two hundred fires! around each fire five hundred men! “the sound of grindstones turning through the night, the firelight that stands between our blades, so let king agamemnon’s own hold hands and look into each other’s frightened eyes. “true god! great master of the widespread sky! if only you would turn me into a god, as you, through me, tomorrow by their ships will see greece die.” silence. a ring of lights. within immaculate in boat-cloaks lined with red king agamemnon’s lords— the depression of retreat. the depression of returning to camp. him at the centre of their circle sobbing, then shouting: “we must run for it!” dark glasses in parked cars. “king agamemnon of mycenae, god called, god raised, god recognized, you are a piece of shit,” diomed said. silence again. “let us praise god,” lord ajax said, “that hector stopped before he reached the ships.” silence again. then nestor (putting his knee back in): “paramount agamemnon, king of kings, lord of the shore, the islands and the sea i shall begin, and end, with you. greece needs good words. like them or not, the credit will be yours. determined. keen to fight, that is our diomed— as i should know. when just a boy of ten i fought blowback of missolonghi, a cannibal, drank blood, he captured you, he buggered you, you never walked again. but diomed lacks experience. god has saved us, momentarily. god loves achilles. you took, and you have kept, achilles’ ribband she.” “i was a fool!” “and now you must appease him, agamemnon. humble words. hands shaken. gifts.” the king—wiping his eyes: “as usual, pylos has said the only things worth hearing. i was mad to take the she. i shall pay fitting damages. plus her, i offer him the corfiot armour that my father wore.” silence. the sea. its whispering. “to which i add: a set of shields. posy, standard, ceremonial. the last, cut from the hide of a one ton lesbian bull.” silence. the sea. “and . . . a chariot! from my own équipe! they smoke along the ground . . . they ride its undulations like a breeze . . .” the sea. “plus: six horses—saddled, bridled and caparisoned, their grooms and veterinarians . . . . . . and six tall shes: two good dancers, two good stitchers, two good cooks. all capable of bearing boys . . . “oh, very well then: twenty loaves of gold, the same of silver, and the same of iron.” masks. lights. behind the lords some hundreds from the army have walked up. lord nestor smiles. lord menelaos smiles. “plus— though it may well reduce your king to destitution: a’kimi’kúriex, my summer palace by the argive sea, its lawns, its terraces, its curtains in whose depths larks dive above a field of waving lilies and fishscale-breakers shatter on blue rocks. then, as he draws their silky heights aside, standing among huge chests of looted booty, long necked, with lowered lids, but candid eyes, my living daughter, íphaniss, a diamond big as a cheeseball for her belly stud. his wife to be! minus—i need not say—her otherwise huge bride-price.” “more!” “more!” “more!” lord ajax almost has to hold him up. “the whole of eastern pel’po’nesia— an area of outstanding natural beauty— its cities, epi’dávros, trów’é’zen, their fortresses, their harbours and their fleets, their taxpayers—glad to accept his modest ways— all this, the greatest benefaction ever known, if he agrees to fight. and he admits i am his king.” instantly, nestor: “an offer god himself could not refuse. all that remains to say is: who shall take it to achilles?” agamemnon: “you will.” starlight. the starlight on the sea. the sea. its whispering mixed with the prayers of ajax and of nestor as they walk along the shore towards achilles’ gate. “my lords?” “your lord.” “this way.” they find him, with guitar, singing of gilgamesh. “take my hands. here they are.” you cannot take your eyes away from him. his own so bright they slow you down. his voice so low, and yet so clear. you know that he is dangerous. “patroclus? friends in need. still, friends. that has not changed, i think. autómedon? wine. “dear lord and master of the widespread sky, accept ourselves, accept our prayers.” their cups are taken. “father friend?” king nestor (for his life): “you know why we are here. we face death. the mass choose slavery. mycenae has admitted he was wrong to wrong yourself. in recompense he offers you the greatest benefaction ever known. take it, and fight. or else hector will burn the ships then kill us randomly. remember what your father said the day when ajax and myself drove up to ask if you could come with us to troy? that you should stand among the blades where honour grows. and secondly, to let your anger go. spirit, and strength, and beauty have combined such awesome power in you a vacant heaven would offer you its throne. think of what those who will come after us will say. save us from hector’s god, from hector, and from hector’s force. i go down on my knees to you, achilles.” “i must admire your courage, father friend, for treating me as if i was a fool. i shall deal with hector as i want to. you and your fellow countrymen will die for how your king has treated me. i have spent five years fighting for your king. my record is: ten coastal and ten inland cities burnt to the ground. their males, massacred. their cattle, and their women, given to him. among the rest, briseis the beautiful, my ribband she. not that i got her courtesy of him. she joined my stock in recognition of my strength, my courage, my superiority, courtesy of yourselves, my lords. i will not fight for him. he aims to personalise my loss. briseis taken from achilles—standard practice: helen from menelaos—war. lord busy busy, building his palisade, mounting my she, one that i might have picked to run my house, raising her to the status of a wife. do i hate him? yes, i hate him. hate him. and should he be afraid of me? he should. i want to harm him. i want him to feel pain. in his body, and between his ears. i must admit, some of the things that you have said are true. but look what he has done to me! to me! the king on whom his kingliness depends! i will not fight for him. hearing your steps, i thought: at last, my friends have come to visit me. they took their time about it, true— after he took my she none of you came— now, though—admittedly they are in trouble, serious trouble—they have arrived as friends, and of their own accord. but you have not come here as friends. and you have not come of your own accord. you came because your king told you to come. you came because i am his last resort. and, incidentally, your last resort. at least he offers stuff. all you have offered is advice: ‘keep your temper . . . mind your tongue . . . think what the world will say . . .’ no mention of your king’s treatment of me. no sign of love for me behind your tears. i will not fight for him. i can remember very well indeed the day you two grand lords came visiting my father’s house, how i ran out to you, and took your hands— the greatest men that i had ever seen: ajax, my fighting cousin, strong, brave, unafraid to die; nestor, the king of sandy pylos, wisdom’s sword. and then, when all had had enough to eat and drink and it was sealed that i should come to troy, then my dear father said that lordship knows not only how to fight, and when to hold its tongue, but of the difference between a child enraged and honour bound lords. i will not fight for him. there is a king to be maintained. you are his lords. my fighting powers prove my inferiority. whatever he, through you, may grant, i must receive it as a favour, not of right, go back to him with downcast looks, a suppliant tone, acknowledge my transgressions—i did not applaud his sticky fingers on my she’s meek flesh. my mother says i have a choice: live as a happy backwood king for aye or give the world an everlasting murmur of my name, and die. be up tomorrow sharp to see me sacrifice to lord poseidon and set sail. oh, yes, his gifts: ‘the greatest benefaction ever known.’ if he put heaven in my hand i would not want it. his offers magnify himself. likewise his child. i do not want to trash the girl. she is like me. bad luck to have poor friends. bad luck to have his kingship as your sire. my father will select my wife. each spring a dozen local kings drive up and lead their daughters naked round our yard. some decent local girl. my father’s worth is all the wealth we will require. you greeks will not take troy. you have disintegrated as a fighting force. troy is your cemetery. blame your king. the man who you say has done all he can. the man who has admitted he was wrong. but he has not done all he can. and he has not admitted he was wrong. or not to me. i want him here, your king. his arms straight down his sides, his shoulders back, announcing loud and clear that he was wrong to take my she. apologising for that wrong, to me, the son of péleus. before my followers, with you, pylos and salamis, crete. sparta. tyrins, argos, calydon, the islands, here, stood to attention on either side of him. that is my offer. take it, or die. nestor may stay the night. you, dear cousin ajax, tell your king what i have said. preferably, in front of everyone.” who said, as my achilles lifted his guitar: “lord, i was never so bethumped with words since first i called my father dad.” the sea. their feet along the sand to agamemnon’s gate. and in starlit air the trojans singing: “i love my wife, i love her dearly, i love the hole she pisses through, i love her lily-white tits and her nut-brown arsehole, i could eat her shit with a wooden spoon.” <line>","living,death,religion,other religions,social commentaries,history & politics,war & conflict,mythology & folklore,greek & roman mythology,heroes & patriotism"

10246,6196,"<line> <line>unlike the ashes that make their home with hot coals, snails prefer moist earth. go on: they advance while gluing themselves to it with their entire bodies. they carry it, they eat it, they shit it. they go through it, it goes through them. it’s the best kind of interpenetration, as between tones, one passive and one active. the passive bathes and nourishes the active, which overturns the other while it eats. <line> <line> <line>(there is more to be said about snails. first of all their immaculate clamminess. their sangfroid. their stretchiness.) <line> <line> <line>one can scarcely conceive of a snail outside its shell and unmoving. the moment it rests it sinks down deep into itself. in fact, its modesty obliges it to move as soon as it has shown its nakedness and revealed its vulnerable shape. the moment it’s exposed, it moves on. <line> <line> <line>during periods of dryness they withdraw into ditches where it seems their bodies are enough to maintain their dampness. no doubt their neighbors there are toads and frogs and other ectothermic animals. but when they come out again they don’t move as quickly. you have to admire their willingness to go into the ditch, given how hard it is for them to come out again. <line> <line> <line>note also that though snails like moist soil, they have no affection for places that are too wet such as marshes or ponds. most assuredly they prefer firm earth, as long as it’s fertile and damp. <line> <line> <line>they are fond as well of moisture-rich vegetables and green leafy plants. they know how to feed on them leaving only the veins, cutting free the most tender leaves. they are hell on salads. <line> <line> <line>what are these beings from the depths of the ditches? though snails love many of their trenches’ qualities they have every intention of leaving. they are in their element but they are also wanderers. and when they emerge into the daylight onto firm ground their shells will preserve their vagabond’s hauteur. <line> <line> <line>it must be a pain to have to haul that trailer around with them everywhere, but they never complain and in the end they are happy about it. how valuable, after all, to be able to go home any time, no matter where you may find yourself, eluding all intruders. it must be worth it. <line> <line> <line>they are a little vain about this convenient ability: “look at me, a vulnerable and sensitive being, who is nevertheless protected from unwanted guests, and so always in possession of happiness and peace of mind!” it’s not surprising the snail holds his head so high. <line> <line> <line>“at the same time i am glued to the earth, always touching it, always progressing, though slowly, and always capable of pulling loose from the soil into myself. après moi le déluge, i don’t care, the slightest kick may roll me anywhere. i can always get up again onto my single foot and reglue myself to the dirt where fate has planted me, and that’s my pantry: the earth, the most common of foods.” <line> <line> <line>joy to the snail! but they leave their proud slime on everything they touch. a silvery trail follows them. and maybe this points the way for the beaks of birds that love to eat them. ay, there’s the rub: “to be or not to be, that is the question!” such vanity! but that’s the danger they face. <line> <line> <line>alone? yes, the snail is quite alone. he has few friends. but he needs no friends to be happy. he sticks to nature, he enjoys his perfect nearness, he is the friend of the soil which he kisses with his whole body. and he befriends the leaves, and the heavens toward which he proudly stretches his head, with eyes sensitive enough to signify nobility, slowness, wisdom, pride, vanity, fire. <line> <line> <line>no, he is nothing like the pig. he lacks those pitiful little scurrying anxious feet. that needful flight from shame. the stoic snail is tougher than that. he is more methodical, more proud, and without a doubt less gluttonous than any pig — pigs after all are capricious, leaving behind one bit of food to chase after something else. that panicky, hurried gluttony, that fear of missing out on something — that’s not for the snail. <line> <line> <line>nothing could be more beautiful than that deliberate and discreet advance. what it must cost them to glide so perfectly along the earth they honor with their presence! each is like a ship trailing its silver wake. they proceed with a majesty that is all the more complete when you consider again the vulnerability of those highly sensitive eyeballs. <line> <line> <line>is the anger of snails perceptible? what examples can be found? as it makes no other gestures, the snail’s passion can probably only be discovered by a more profuse and rapid effusion of slime. the slime of pride. so one can see the expression of their rage is identical with that of their egotism. so they rule the world in their rich and silvery fashion. <line> <line> <line>the expression of their anger, like that of their pride, shines as it dries. but it also makes the trail that reveals them to predators. what’s more, this trail is ephemeral and lasts only until the next rain. <line> <line> <line>that’s how it is with everyone who speaks in an entirely subjective way, in verses and lines only, without taking care to build their phrases into a solid dwelling with more than two dimensions. something more durable than themselves. <line> <line> <line>but undoubtedly they don’t feel this need. they are heroes, that is to say beings whose existence alone is a work of art — not artists who merely make masterpieces. <line> <line> <line>here i touch on one of the main points of their lesson, something they have in common with all shelled beings: that shell, part of their essence, is at the same time a work of art, a monument. it lasts longer than they do. <line> <line> <line>that is the example that snails offer us: saints who make masterpieces of their lives, works of art of their own perfection. they secrete form. nothing outside themselves, their necessity, or their needs is their work. nothing is out of proportion with their physical being. nothing that is unnecessary or obligatory. <line> <line> <line>and so they delineate the duties of humanity: great thoughts come from the heart. live a better life and make better verses. morality and rhetoric combine in the ambition and desire of the wise. <line> <line> <line>how are they saints? precisely by obedience to their nature. so: know yourself. and accept yourself for what you are. in agreement with your vices. in proportion with your measure. <line> <line> <line>what is most appropriate to the human being?

10307,8506,"<line> <line>1 afoot and light-hearted i take to the open road, healthy, free, the world before me, the long brown path before me leading wherever i choose. henceforth i ask not good-fortune, i myself am good-fortune, henceforth i whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing, done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms, strong and content i travel the open road. the earth, that is sufficient, i do not want the constellations any nearer, i know they are very well where they are, i know they suffice for those who belong to them. (still here i carry my old delicious burdens, i carry them, men and women, i carry them with me wherever i go, i swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them, i am fill’d with them, and i will fill them in return.) 2 you road i enter upon and look around, i believe you are not all that is here, i believe that much unseen is also here. here the profound lesson of reception, nor preference nor denial, the black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas’d, the illiterate person, are not denied; the birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar’s tramp, the drunkard’s stagger, the laughing party of mechanics, the escaped youth, the rich person’s carriage, the fop, the eloping couple, the early market-man, the hearse, the moving of furniture into the town, the return back from the town, they pass, i also pass, any thing passes, none can be interdicted, none but are accepted, none but shall be dear to me. 3 you air that serves me with breath to speak! you objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them shape! you light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable showers! you paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides! i believe you are latent with unseen existences, you are so dear to me. you flagg’d walks of the cities! you strong curbs at the edges! you ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timber-lined sides! you distant ships! you rows of houses! you window-pierc’d façades! you roofs! you porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards! you windows whose transparent shells might expose so much! you doors and ascending steps! you arches! you gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden crossings! from all that has touch’d you i believe you have imparted to yourselves, and now would impart the same secretly to me, from the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive surfaces, and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable with me. 4 the earth expanding right hand and left hand, the picture alive, every part in its best light, the music falling in where it is wanted, and stopping where it is not wanted, the cheerful voice of the public road, the gay fresh sentiment of the road. o highway i travel, do you say to me do not leave me? do you say venture not—if you leave me you are lost? do you say i am already prepared, i am well-beaten and undenied, adhere to me? o public road, i say back i am not afraid to leave you, yet i love you, you express me better than i can express myself, you shall be more to me than my poem. i think heroic deeds were all conceiv’d in the open air, and all free poems also, i think i could stop here myself and do miracles, i think whatever i shall meet on the road i shall like, and whoever beholds me shall like me, i think whoever i see must be happy. 5 from this hour i ordain myself loos’d of limits and imaginary lines, going where i list, my own master total and absolute, listening to others, considering well what they say, pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating, gently,but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that would hold me. i inhale great draughts of space, the east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are mine. i am larger, better than i thought, i did not know i held so much goodness. all seems beautiful to me, i can repeat over to men and women you have done such good to me i would do the same to you, i will recruit for myself and you as i go, i will scatter myself among men and women as i go, i will toss a new gladness and roughness among them, whoever denies me it shall not trouble me, whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me. 6 now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me, now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear’d it would not astonish me. now i see the secret of the making of the best persons, it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth. here a great personal deed has room, (such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men, its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all authority and all argument against it.) here is the test of wisdom, wisdom is not finally tested in schools, wisdom cannot be pass’d from one having it to another not having it, wisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own proof, applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content, is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and the excellence of things; something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes it out of the soul. now i re-examine philosophies and religions, they may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at all under the spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents. here is realization, here is a man tallied—he realizes here what he has in him, the past, the future, majesty, love—if they are vacant of you, you are vacant of them. only the kernel of every object nourishes; where is he who tears off the husks for you and me? where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me? here is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion’d, it is apropos; do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers? do you know the talk of those turning eye-balls? 7 here is the efflux of the soul, the efflux of the soul comes from within through embower’d gates, ever provoking questions, these yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness why are they? why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight expands my blood? why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank? why are there trees i never walk under but large and melodious thoughts descend upon me? (i think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always drop fruit as i pass;) what is it i interchange so suddenly with strangers? what with some driver as i ride on the seat by his side? what with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as i walk by and pause? what gives me to be free to a woman’s and man’s good-will? what gives them to be free to mine? 8 the efflux of the soul is happiness, here is happiness, i think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times, now it flows unto us, we are rightly charged. here rises the fluid and attaching character, the fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of man and woman, (the herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day out of the roots of themselves, than it sprouts fresh and sweet continually out of itself.) toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the love of young and old, from it falls distill’d the charm that mocks beauty and attainments, toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact. 9 allons! whoever you are come travel with me! traveling with me you find what never tires. the earth never tires, the earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first, nature is rude and incomprehensible at first, be not discouraged, keep on, there are divine things well envelop’d, i swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can tell. allons! we must not stop here, however sweet these laid-up stores, however convenient this dwelling we cannot remain here, however shelter’d this port and however calm these waters we must not anchor here, however welcome the hospitality that surrounds us we are permitted to receive it but a little while. 10 allons! the inducements shall be greater, we will sail pathless and wild seas, we will go where winds blow, waves dash, and the yankee clipper speeds by under full sail. allons! with power, liberty, the earth, the elements, health, defiance, gayety, self-esteem, curiosity; allons! from all formules! from your formules, o bat-eyed and materialistic priests. the stale cadaver blocks up the passage—the burial waits no longer. allons! yet take warning! he traveling with me needs the best blood, thews, endurance, none may come to the trial till he or she bring courage and health, come not here if you have already spent the best of yourself, only those may come who come in sweet and determin’d bodies, no diseas’d person, no rum-drinker or venereal taint is permitted here. (i and mine do not convince by arguments, similes, rhymes, we convince by our presence.) 11 listen! i will be honest with you, i do not offer the old smooth prizes, but offer rough new prizes, these are the days that must happen to you: you shall not heap up what is call’d riches, you shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve, you but arrive at the city to which you were destin’d, you hardly settle yourself to satisfaction before you are call’d by an irresistible call to depart, you shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those who remain behind you, what beckonings of love you receive you shall only answer with passionate kisses of parting, you shall not allow the hold of those who spread their reach’d hands toward you. 12 allons! after the great companions, and to belong to them! they too are on the road—they are the swift and majestic men—they are the greatest women, enjoyers of calms of seas and storms of seas, sailors of many a ship, walkers of many a mile of land, habituès of many distant countries, habituès of far-distant dwellings, trusters of men and women, observers of cities, solitary toilers, pausers and contemplators of tufts, blossoms, shells of the shore, dancers at wedding-dances, kissers of brides, tender helpers of children, bearers of children, soldiers of revolts, standers by gaping graves, lowerers-down of coffins, journeyers over consecutive seasons, over the years, the curious years each emerging from that which preceded it, journeyers as with companions, namely their own diverse phases, forth-steppers from the latent unrealized baby-days, journeyers gayly with their own youth, journeyers with their bearded and well-grain’d manhood, journeyers with their womanhood, ample, unsurpass’d, content, journeyers with their own sublime old age of manhood or womanhood, old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth of the universe, old age, flowing free with the delicious near-by freedom of death. 13 allons! to that which is endless as it was beginningless, to undergo much, tramps of days, rests of nights, to merge all in the travel they tend to, and the days and nights they tend to, again to merge them in the start of superior journeys, to see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it and pass it, to conceive no time, however distant, but what you may reach it and pass it, to look up or down no road but it stretches and waits for you, however long but it stretches and waits for you, to see no being, not god’s or any, but you also go thither, to see no possession but you may possess it, enjoying all without labor or purchase, abstracting the feast yet not abstracting one particle of it, to take the best of the farmer’s farm and the rich man’s elegant villa, and the chaste blessings of the well-married couple, and the fruits of orchards and flowers of gardens, to take to your use out of the compact cities as you pass through, to carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever you go, to gather the minds of men out of their brains as you encounter them, to gather the love out of their hearts, to take your lovers on the road with you, for all that you leave them behind you, to know the universe itself as a road, as many roads, as roads for traveling souls. all parts away for the progress of souls, all religion, all solid things, arts, governments—all that was or is apparent upon this globe or any globe, falls into niches and corners before the procession of souls along the grand roads of the universe. of the progress of the souls of men and women along the grand roads of the universe, all other progress is the needed emblem and sustenance. forever alive, forever forward, stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn, baffled, mad, turbulent, feeble, dissatisfied, desperate, proud, fond, sick, accepted by men, rejected by men, they go! they go! i know that they go, but i know not where they go, but i know that they go toward the best—toward something great. whoever you are, come forth! or man or woman come forth! you must not stay sleeping and dallying there in the house, though you built it, or though it has been built for you. out of the dark confinement! out from behind the screen! it is useless to protest, i know all and expose it. behold through you as bad as the rest, through the laughter, dancing, dining, supping, of people, inside of dresses and ornaments, inside of those wash’d and trimm’d faces, behold a secret silent loathing and despair. no husband, no wife, no friend, trusted to hear the confession, another self, a duplicate of every one, skulking and hiding it goes, formless and wordless through the streets of the cities, polite and bland in the parlors, in the cars of railroads, in steamboats, in the public assembly, home to the houses of men and women, at the table, in the bedroom, everywhere, smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright, death under the breast-bones, hell under the skull-bones, under the broadcloth and gloves, under the ribbons and artificial flowers, keeping fair with the customs, speaking not a syllable of itself, speaking of any thing else but never of itself. 14 allons! through struggles and wars! the goal that was named cannot be countermanded. have the past struggles succeeded? what has succeeded? yourself? your nation? nature? now understand me well—it is provided in the essence of things that from any fruition of success, no matter what, shall come forth something to make a greater struggle necessary. my call is the call of battle, i nourish active rebellion, he going with me must go well arm’d, he going with me goes often with spare diet, poverty, angry enemies, desertions. 15 allons! the road is before us! it is safe—i have tried it—my own feet have tried it well—be not detain’d! let the paper remain on the desk unwritten, and the book on the shelf unopen’d! let the tools remain in the workshop! let the money remain unearn’d! let the school stand! mind not the cry of the teacher! let the preacher preach in his pulpit! let the lawyer plead in the court, and the judge expound the law. camerado, i give you my hand!

10309,12516,"<line> <line>by the last few times we saw her it was clear that things were different. when you tried to help her get out of the car or get from the car to the door or across the apartment house hall to the elevator there was a new sense of heaviness or of inertia in the body. it wasn’t that she was less willing to be helped to walk but that the walking itself had become less willing. maybe the stupid demogorgon blind recalcitrance of body, resentful of the laws of mind and spirit, was getting its own back now, or maybe a new and subtle, alien, intelligence of body was obedient now to other laws: “weight is the measure of the force with which a body is drawn downward to the center of the earth”; “inertia is the tendency of a body to resist proceeding to its fate in any way other than that determined for itself.” that evening, at the bromells’ apartment, after she had been carried up through the rational structure by articulate stages, floor after flashing floor, and after we helped her get across the hall, and get across the room to a chair, somehow we got her seated in a chair that was placed a little too far away from the nearest table, at the edge of the abyss, and there she sat, exposed, her body the object of our attention— the heaviness of it, the helpless graceless leg, the thick stocking, the leg brace, the medical shoe. at work between herself and us there was a new principle of social awkwardness and skillfulness required of each of us. our tones of voice in this easy conversation were instruments of marvelous finesse, measuring and maintaining with exactitude “the fact or condition of the difference there was between us, both in space and time.” her smiling made her look as if she had just then tasted something delicious, the charm her courtesy attributed to her friends. this decent elegant fellow human being was seated in virtue, character, disability, behind her the order of the ranged bookshelves, the windows monitored by venetian blinds— “these can be raised or lowered; numerous slats, horizontally arranged, and parallel, which can be tilted so as to admit precisely the desired light or air.” we were all her friends, maggie, and bill, and anne, and i, and the nice boston brahmin elderly man named duncan, utterly friendly and benign. and of course it wasn’t whether or not the world was benign but whether it looked at her too much. she wasn’t “painfully shy” but just the same i wouldn’t be surprised if there had been painfulness in her shyness earlier on, say at dancing school. like others, though, she had survived her childhood somehow. nor do i mean she was unhappy. maybe more or less so before her marriage. one had the sense of trips arranged, committees, concerts, baffled courage living it through, giving it order and style. and one had the sense of the late marriage as of two bafflements inventing the sense they made together. the marriage seemed, to the outside world, and probably was, radiant and triumphant, and i think that one could almost certainly say that during the last, heroic, phase of things, after his death, and after the stroke, she had by force of character and careful management, maintained a certain degree of happiness. the books there on the bookshelves told their stories, line after line, all of them evenly spaced, and spaces between the words. you could fall through the spaces. in one of the books dr. johnson told the story: “in the scale of being, wherever it begins, or ends, there are chasms infinitely deep; infinite vacuities ... for surely, nothing can so disturb the passions, or perplex the intellects of man so much, as the disruption of this union with visible nature, separation from all that has delighted or engaged him, a change not only of the place but of the manner of his being, an entrance into a state not simply which he knows not, but perhaps a state he has not faculties to know.” the dinner was delicious, fresh greens, and reds, and yellows, produce of the season due, and fish from the nearby sea; and there were also ashes to be eaten, and dirt to drink. <line>","living,health & illness,the body,relationships,friends & enemies,nature"

<line> <line> i opened my eyes and saw one of the girls running toward me, her hands like claws, as if she intended to tear me apart. she screamed again: murderer! and then stopped abruptly a few paces away, filthy, disheveled, with a great bewilderment, spreading across her face, a wondrous pity. i stood in front of her, rifle in my hands, tears in my eyes. <line> <line> and they were certainly a marvelous thing, those tears, not only for her, but for me as well. <line> <line> my mother . . . <line> <line> my mother was lying on her back, her eyes were closed, and she seemed to be asleep; even her hand, abandoned on the sheets, had dozed off. i fell silent, looking at the moon rising inch by inch <line> <line> over the olive trees of settignano. <line> <line> it gave me great solace, that moon and those trees. that bright silver moon over silvery trees, that moon in the shape of an olive leaf, clean and transparent, shining like a vein of silver, pulsing through green marble in the incensed darkness of a church. <line>","living,death,social commentaries,crime & punishment,war & conflict"

downdrafts of its current. <line> <line>the breeze threshed the palms on the cool december road <line> <line>where the comet hurtled with empty leopard seats, <line> <line>so fast a man on a donkey trying to read <line> <line>its oncoming fiery sign heard only two thudding beats <line> <line>from the up-tempo zouk that its stereo played <line> <line>when it screeched round a bridge and began to ascend <line> <line>away from the palm-fronds and their wickerwork shade <line> <line>that left the windscreen clear as it locked round the bend, <line> <line>where hector suddenly saw the trotting piglet <line> <line>and thought of plunkett’s warning as he heard it screel <line> <line>with the same sound that the tires of the comet <line> <line>made rounding the curve from the sweat-greased steering wheel. <line> <line>the rear wheels spin to a dead stop, like a helm. <line> <line>the piglet trots down the safer side of the road. <line> <line>lodged in their broken branches the curled letters flame. <line> <line>hector had both hands on the wheel. his head was bowed <line> <line>under the swaying statue of the madonna <line> <line>of the rocks, her smile swayed under the blue hood, <line> <line>and when her fluted robe stilled, the smile stayed on her <line> <line>dimpled porcelain. she saw, in the bowed man, the calm <line> <line>common oval of prayer, the head’s usual angle <line> <line>over the pew of the dashboard. her lifted palm, <line> <line>small as a doll’s from its cerulean mantle, <line> <line>indicated that he had prayed enough to the lace <line> <line>of foam round the cliff’s altar, that now, if he wished, <line> <line>he could lift his head, but he stayed in the same place, <line> <line>the way a man will remain when mass is finished, <line> <line>not unclenching his hands or freeing one to cross <line> <line>forehead, heart, and shoulders swiftly and then kneel <line> <line>facing the altar. he bowed in endless remorse, <line> <line>for her mercy at what he had done to achille, <line> <line>his brother. but his arc was over, for the course <line> <line>of every comet is such. the fated crescent <line> <line>was printed on the road by the scorching tires. <line> <line>a salt tear ran down the porcelain cheek and it went <line> <line>in one slow drop to the clenched knuckle that still gripped <line> <line>the wheel. on the flecked sea, the uninterrupted <line> <line>wind herded the long african combers, and whipped <line> <line>the small flag of the island on its silver spearhead.ii <line> <line>drivers leant over the rail. one seized my luggage <line> <line>off the porter’s cart. the rest burst into patois, <line> <line>with gestures of despair at the lost privilege <line> <line>of driving me, then turned to other customers. <line> <line>in the evening pastures horses grazed, their hides wet <line> <line>with light that shot its lances over the combers. <line> <line>i had the transport all to myself. <line> <line> “you all set? <line> <line>good. a good pal of mine died in that chariot <line> <line>of his called the comet.” <line> <line> he turned in the front seat, <line> <line>spinning the air with his free hand. i sat, sprawled out <line> <line>in the back, discouraging talk, with my crossed feet. <line> <line>“you never know when, eh? i was at the airport <line> <line>that day. i see him take off like a rocket. <line> <line>i always said that thing have too much horsepower. <line> <line>and so said, so done. the same hotel, chief, correct?” <line> <line>i saw the coastal villages receding as <line> <line>the highway’s tongue translated bush into forest, <line> <line>the wild savannah into moderate pastures, <line> <line>that other life going in its “change for the best,” <line> <line>its peace paralyzed in a postcard, a concrete <line> <line>future ahead of it all, in the cinder-blocks <line> <line>of hotel development with the obsolete <line> <line>craft of the carpenter, as i sensed, in the neat <line> <line>marinas, the fisherman’s phantom. old oarlocks <line> <line>and rusting fretsaw. my craft required the same <line> <line>crouching care, the same crabbed, natural devotion <line> <line>of the hand that stencilled a flowered window-frame <line> <line>or planed an elegant canoe; its time was gone <line> <line>with the spirit in the wood, as wood grew obsolete <line> <line>and plasterers smoothed the blank page of white concrete. <line> <line>i watched the afternoon sea. didn’t i want the poor <line> <line>to stay in the same light so that i could transfix <line> <line>them in amber, the afterglow of an empire, <line> <line>preferring a shed of palm-thatch with tilted sticks <line> <line>to that blue bus-stop? didn’t i prefer a road <line> <line>from which tracks climbed into the thickening syntax <line> <line>of colonial travellers, the measured prose i read <line> <line>as a schoolboy? that cove, with its brown shallows <line> <line>there, praslin? that heron? had they waited for me <line> <line>to develop my craft? why hallow that pretence <line> <line>of preserving what they left, the hypocrisy <line> <line>of loving them from hotels, a biscuit-tin fence <line> <line>smothered in love-vines, scenes to which i was attached <line> <line>as blindly as plunkett with his remorseful research? <line> <line>art is history’s nostalgia, it prefers a thatched <line> <line>roof to a concrete factory, and the huge church <line> <line>above a bleached village. the gap between the driver <line> <line>and me increased when he said: <line> <line> “the place changing, eh?” <line> <line>where an old rumshop had gone, but not that river <line> <line>with its clogged shadows. that would make me a stranger. <line> <line>“all to the good,” he said. i said, “all to the good,” <line> <line>then, “whoever they are,” to myself. i caught his eyes <line> <line>in the mirror. we were climbing out of micoud. <line> <line>hadn’t i made their poverty my paradise? <line> <line>his back could have been hector’s, ferrying tourists <line> <line>in the other direction home, the leopard seat <line> <line>scratching their damp backs like the fur-covered armrests. <line> <line>he had driven his burnt-out cargo, tired of sweat, <line> <line>who longed for snow on the moon and didn’t have to face <line> <line>the heat of that sinking sun, who knew a climate <line> <line>as monotonous as this one could only produce <line> <line>from its unvarying vegetation flashes <line> <line>of a primal insight like those red-pronged lilies <line> <line>that shot from the verge, that their dried calabashes <line> <line>of fake african masks for a fake achilles <line> <line>rattled with the seeds that came from other men’s minds. <line> <line>so let them think that. who needed art in this place <line> <line>where even the old women strode with stiff-backed spines, <line> <line>and the fishermen had such adept thumbs, such grace <line> <line>these people had, but what they envied most in them <line> <line>was the calypso part, the caribbean lilt <line> <line>still in the shells of their ears, like the surf’s rhythm, <line> <line>until too much happiness was shadowed with guilt <line> <line>like any eden, and they sighed at the sign: hewannorra (iounalao), the gold sea <line> <line>flat as a credit-card, extending its line <line> <line>to a beach that now looked just like everywhere else, <line> <line>greece or hawaii. now the goddamn souvenir <line> <line>felt absurd, excessive. the painted gourds, the shells. <line> <line>their own faces as brown as gourds. mine felt as strange <line> <line>as those at the counter feeling their bodies change.iii <line> <line>change lay in our silence. we had come to that bend <line> <line>where the trees are warped by wind, and the cliffs, raw, <line> <line>shelve surely to foam. <line> <line> “is right here everything end,” <line> <line>the driver said, and rammed open the transport door <line> <line>on his side, then mine. <line> <line> “anyway, chief, the view nice.” <line> <line>i joined him at the gusting edge. <line> <line> “his name was hector.” <line> <line>the name was bent like the trees on the precipice <line> <line>to point inland. in its echo a man-o’-war <line> <line>screamed on the wind. the driver moved off for a piss, <line> <line>then shouted over his shoulder: <line> <line> “a road-warrior. <line> <line>he would drive like a madman when the power took. <line> <line>he had a nice woman. maybe he died for her.” <line> <line>for her and tourism, i thought. the driver shook <line> <line>himself, zipping then hoisting his crotch. <line> <line> “crazy, but <line> <line>a gentle fellow anyway, with a very good brain.” <line> <line>cut to a leopard galloping on a dry plain <line> <line>across serengeti. cut to the spraying fans <line> <line>drummed by a riderless stallion, its wild mane <line> <line>scaring the scamander. cut to a woman’s hands <line> <line>clenched towards her mouth with no sound. cut to the wheel <line> <line>of a chariot’s spiked hubcap. cut to the face <line> <line>of his muscling jaw, then flashback to achille <line> <line>hurling a red tin and a cutlass. next, a vase <line> <line>with a girl’s hoarse whisper echoing “omeros,” <line> <line>as in a conch-shell. cut to a shield of silver <line> <line>rolling like a hubcap. rewind, in slow motion, <line> <line>myrmidons gathering by a village river <line> <line>with lances for oars. cut to the surpliced ocean <line> <line>droning its missal. cut. a crane hoisting a wreck. <line> <line>a horse nosing the surf, then shuddering its neck. <line> <line>he’d paid the penalty of giving up the sea <line> <line>as graceless and as treacherous as it had seemed, <line> <line>for the taxi-business; he was making money, <line> <line>but all of that money was making him ashamed <line> <line>of the long afternoons of shouting by the wharf <line> <line>hustling passengers. he missed the uncertain sand <line> <line>under his feet, he sighed for the trough of a wave, <line> <line>and the jerk of the oar when it turned in his hand, <line> <line>and the rose conch sunset with its low pelicans. <line> <line>castries was corrupting him with its roaring life, <line> <line>its littered market, with too many transport vans <line> <line>competing. castries had been his common-law wife <line> <line>who, like helen, he had longed for from a distance, <line> <line>and now he had both, but a frightening discontent <line> <line>hollowed his face; to find that the sea was a love <line> <line>he could never lose made every gesture violent: <line> <line>ramming the side-door shut, raking the clutch. he drove <line> <line>as if driven by furies, but furies paid the rent. <line> <line>a man who cursed the sea had cursed his own mother. mer was both mother and sea. in his lost canoe <line> <line>he had said his prayers. but now he was in another <line> <line>kind of life that was changing him with his brand-new <line> <line>stereo, its endless garages, where he could not <line> <line>whip off his shirt, hearing the conch’s summoning note.chapter xlvii <line> <line>hector was buried near the sea he had loved once. <line> <line>not too far from the shallows where he fought achille <line> <line>for a tin and helen. he did not hear the sea-almond’s <line> <line>moan over the bay when philoctete blew the shell, <line> <line>nor the one drumbeat of a wave-thud, nor a sail <line> <line>rattling to rest as its day’s work was over, <line> <line>and its mate, gauging depth, bent over the gunwale, <line> <line>then wearily sounding the fathoms with an oar, <line> <line>the same rite his shipmates would repeat soon enough <line> <line>when it was their turn to lie quiet as hector, <line> <line>lowering a pitch-pine canoe in the earth’s trough, <line> <line>to sleep under the piled conchs, through every weather <line> <line>on the violet-wreathed mound. crouching for his friend to hear, <line> <line>achille whispered about their ancestral river, <line> <line>and those things he would recognize when he got there, <line> <line>his true home, forever and ever and ever, <line> <line>forever, compère. then philoctete limped over <line> <line>and rested his hand firmly on a shaking shoulder <line> <line>to anchor his sorrow. seven seas and helen <line> <line>did not come nearer. achille had carried an oar <line> <line>to the church and propped it outside with the red tin. <line> <line>now his voice strengthened. he said: “mate, this is your spear,” <line> <line>and laid the oar slowly, the same way he had placed <line> <line>the parallel oars in the hull of the gommier <line> <line>the day the african swift and its shadow raced. <line> <line>and this was the prayer that achille could not utter: <line> <line>“the spear that i give you, my friend, is only wood. <line> <line>vexation is past. i know how well you treat her. <line> <line>you never know my admiration, when you stood <line> <line>crossing the sun at the bow of the long canoe <line> <line>with the plates of your chest like a shield; i would say <line> <line>any enemy so was a compliment. ’cause no <line> <line>african ever hurled his wide seine at the bay <line> <line>by which he was born with such beauty. you hear me? men <line> <line>did not know you like me. all right. sleep good. good night.” <line> <line>achille moved philoctete’s hand, then he saw helen <line> <line>standing alone and veiled in the widowing light. <line> <line>then he reached down to the grave and lifted the tin <line> <line>to her. helen nodded. a wind blew out the sun.ii <line> <line>pride set in helen’s face after this, like a stone <line> <line>bracketed with hector’s name; her lips were incised <line> <line>by its dates in parenthesis. she seemed more stern, <line> <line>more ennobled by distance as she slowly crossed <line> <line>the hot street of the village like a distant sail <line> <line>on the horizon. grief heightened her. when she smiled <line> <line>it was with such distance that it was hard to tell <line> <line>if she had heard your condolence. it was the child, <line> <line>ma kilman told them, that made her more beautiful.iii <line> <line>the rites of the island were simplified by its elements, <line> <line>which changed places. the grooved sea was achille’s garden, <line> <line>the ridged plot of rattling plantains carried their sense <line> <line>of the sea, and philoctete, on his height, often heard, in <line> <line>a wind that suddenly churned the rage of deep gorges, <line> <line>the leafy sound of far breakers plunging with smoke, <line> <line>and for smoke there were the bonfires which the sun catches <line> <line>on the blue heights at sunrise, doing the same work <line> <line>as philoctete clearing his plot, just as, at sunset, <line> <line>smoke came from the glowing rim of the horizon as if <line> <line>from his enamel pot. the woodsmoke smelt of a regret <line> <line>that men cannot name. on the charred field, the massive <line> <line>sawn trunks burnt slowly like towers, and the great <line> <line>indigo dusk slowly plumed down, devouring the still leaves, <line> <line>igniting the firefly huts, lifting the panicky egret <line> <line>to beat its lagoon and shelve in the cage of the mangroves, <line> <line>take in the spars of its sails, then with quick-pricking head <line> <line>anchor itself shiftingly, and lift its question again. <line> <line>at night, the island reversed its elements, the heron <line> <line>of a quarter-moon floated from hector’s grave, rain <line> <line>rose upwards from the sea, and the corrugated iron <line> <line>of the sea glittered with nailheads. ragged <line> <line>plantains bent and stepped with their rustling powers <line> <line>over the furrows of philoctete’s garden, a chorus of aged <line> <line>ancestors and straw, and, rustling, surrounded every house <line> <line>in the village with its back garden, with its rank midden <line> <line>of rusted chamber pots, rotting nets, and the moon’s cold basin. <line> <line>they sounded, when they shook, after the moonlit meridian <line> <line>of their crossing, like the night-surf; they gazed in <line> <line>silence at the shadows of their lamplit children. <line> <line>at philoctete, groaning and soaking the flower on his shin <line> <line>with hot sulphur, cleaning its edges with yellow vaseline, <line> <line>and, gripping his knee, squeezing rags from the basin. <line> <line>at night, when yards are asleep, and the broken line <line> <line>of the surf hisses like philo, “bon dieu, aie, waie, my sin <line> <line>is this sore?” the old plantains suffer and shine.chapter xlviii <line> <line>islands of bay leaves in the medicinal bath <line> <line>of a cauldron, a sibylline cure. the citron <line> <line>sprig of a lime-tree dividing the sky in half <line> <line>dipped its divining rod. the white spray of the thorn, <line> <line>which the swift bends lightly, waited for a black hand <line> <line>to break it in bits and boil its leaves for the wound <line> <line>from the pronged anchor rusting in clean bottom-sand. <line> <line>ma kilman, in a black hat with its berried fringe, <line> <line>eased herself sideways down the broken concrete step <line> <line>of the rumshop’s back door, closed it, and rammed the hinge <line> <line>tight. the bolt caught a finger and with that her instep <line> <line>arch twisted and she let out a soft catholic <line> <line>curse, then crossed herself. she closed the gate. the asphalt <line> <line>sweated with the heat, the limp breadfruit leaves were thick <line> <line>over the fence. her spectacles swam in their sweat. <line> <line>she plucked an armpit. the damn wig was badly made. <line> <line>she was going to five o’clock mass, to la messe, <line> <line>and sometimes she had to straighten it as she prayed <line> <line>until the wafer dissolved her with tenderness, <line> <line>the way a raindrop melts on the tongue of a breeze. <line> <line>in the church’s cool cave the sweat dried from her eyes. <line> <line>she rolled down the elastic bands below the knees <line> <line>of her swollen stockings. it was then that their vise <line> <line>round her calves reminded her of philoctete. then, <line> <line>numbering her beads, she began her own litany <line> <line>of berries, hail mary marigolds that stiffen <line> <line>their aureoles in the heights, mild anemone <line> <line>and clear watercress, the sacred heart of jesus <line> <line>pierced like the anthurium, the thorns of logwood, <line> <line>called the tree of life, the aloe good for seizures, <line> <line>the hole in the daisy’s palm, with its drying blood <line> <line>that was the hole in the fisherman’s shin since he was <line> <line>pierced by a hook; there was the pale, roadside tisane <line> <line>of her malarial childhood. there was this one <line> <line>for easing a birth-breach, that one for a love-bath, <line> <line>before the buds of green sugar-apples in the sun <line> <line>ripened like her nipples in girlhood. but what path <line> <line>led through nettles to the cure, the furious sibyl <line> <line>couldn’t remember. mimosa winced from her fingers, <line> <line>shutting like jalousies at some passing evil <line> <line>when she reached for them. the smell of incense lingers <line> <line>in her clothes. inside, the candle-flames are erect <line> <line>round the bier of the altar while she and her friends <line> <line>old-talk on the steps, but the plant keeps its secret <line> <line>when her memory reaches, shuttering in its fronds.ii <line> <line>the dew had not yet dried on the white-ribbed awnings <line> <line>and the nodding palanquins of umbrella yams <line> <line>where the dark grove had not heat but early mornings <line> <line>of perpetual freshness, in which the bearded arms <line> <line>of a cedar held council. between its gnarled toes <line> <line>grew the reek of an unknown weed; its pronged flower <line> <line>sprang like a buried anchor; its windborne odours <line> <line>diverted the bee from its pollen, but its power, <line> <line>rooted in bitterness, drew her bowed head by the nose <line> <line>as a spike does a circling bull. to approach it <line> <line>ma kilman lowered her head to one side and screened <line> <line>the stench with a cologned handkerchief. the mulch it <line> <line>was rooted in carried the smell, when it gangrened, <line> <line>of philoctete’s cut. in her black dress, her berried <line> <line>black hat, she climbed a goat-path up from the village, <line> <line>past the stones with dried palms and conchs, where the buried <line> <line>suffer the sun all day sunday, while goats forage <line> <line>the new wreaths. once more she pulled at the itch in her <line> <line>armpits, nearly dropping her purse. then she climbed hard <line> <line>up the rain-cracked path, the bay closing behind her <line> <line>like a wound, and rested. everything that echoed <line> <line>repeated its outline: a goat’s doddering bleat, <line> <line>a hammer multiplying a roof, and, through the back yards, <line> <line>a mother cursing a boy too nimble to beat. <line> <line>ma kilman picked up her purse and sighed on upwards <line> <line>to the thread of the smell, one arm behind her back, <line> <line>passing the cactus, the thorn trees, and then the wood <line> <line>appeared over her, thick green, the green almost black <line> <line>as her dress in its shade, its border of flowers <line> <line>flecking the pasture with spray. then she staggered back <line> <line>from the line of ants at her feet. she saw the course <line> <line>they had kept behind her, following her from church, <line> <line>signalling a language she could not recognize.iii <line> <line>a swift had carried the strong seed in its stomach <line> <line>centuries ago from its antipodal shore, <line> <line>skimming the sea-troughs, outdarting ospreys, her luck <line> <line>held to its shadow. she aimed to carry the cure <line> <line>that precedes every wound; the reversible bight <line> <line>of benin was her bow, her target the ringed haze <line> <line>of a circling horizon. the star-grains at night <line> <line>made her hungrier; the leafless sea with no house <line> <line>for her weariness. sometimes she dozed in her flight <line> <line>for a swift’s second, closing the seeds of her stare, <line> <line>then ruddering straight. the dry sea-flakes whitened her <line> <line>breast, her feathers thinned. then, one dawn the day-star <line> <line>rose slowly from the wrong place and it frightened her <line> <line>because all the breakers were blowing from the wrong <line> <line>east. she saw the horned island and uncurled her claws <line> <line>with one frail cry, since swifts are not given to song, <line> <line>and fluttered down to a beach, ejecting the seed <line> <line>in grass near the sand. she nestled in dry seaweed. <line> <line>in a year she was bleached bone. all of that motion <line> <line>a pile of fragile ash from the fire of her will, <line> <line>but the vine grew its own wings, out of the ocean <line> <line>it climbed like the ants, the ancestors of achille, <line> <line>the women carrying coals after the dark door <line> <line>slid over the hold. as the weed grew in odour <line> <line>so did its strength at the damp root of the cedar, <line> <line>where the flower was anchored at the mottled root <line> <line>as a lizard crawled upwards, foot by sallow foot. <line>","activities,travels & journeys,relationships,men &

10443,6408,"<line> <line>was it pascal who said “almost all our misery has come from not being able to remain alone in our rooms”? baudelaire thought it might have been, but was not sure. and let’s take a look at that “almost” which i’m very glad is there. i can think of lots of misery that had nothing to do with my not having been alone in my room. when i get a rejection email on a train for a piece of work i had high hopes for is one example. or to go way back, when i returned home to find my white mouse dead when i was eleven or twelve. or to take a mundane example, when a plane i’m booked on is twelve hours delayed, while i hang about the airport. <line> <line>i have never had a huge problem with solitude, it is true. as a child i read voraciously, and would find some hidden corner to lurk with my book. the game of golf is one where one can enjoy being alone, especially very early on a beautiful morning. the time when i most felt alone was when the missionaries came to my school and we all had to endure a silent retreat for three days. at the end of that time i felt like one of those astronauts in films who have to stay on the moon for months. <line> <line>baudelaire claimed his friend the devil loved bleak, solitary places where the spirit of murder and lust was more likely to ignite. he decided that this was not really a danger for most of us, though, only for those idle, fanciful folk prone to enigmas and dreaming. the type of person who should most avoid being alone is a chatterbox or maybe a television pundit. but what’s to stop these people being verbose in their own company? did crusoe, for example, stay quiet on his island before friday came? according to elizabeth bishop in her great poem, “crusoe in england,” he did not. <line> <line>and in order to write that poem, ms. bishop needed to be alone. this did not stop her from cooking meals and inviting friends to help her eat the food and drink wine with her. after this, probably the next morning, she went back to the poem and her solitude. <line> <line>i feel the french maybe exaggerate the benefits of being alone. that philosopher and writer jean-paul sartre for example, his play huis-clos with its famous line “l’enfer, c’est les autres.” yes, we all know how annoying other people often are, and how strong the urge to escape from them can be. but the two characters vladimir and estragon in beckett’s waiting for godot show that even in an absurdist setting companionship has its importance. it’s said beckett got his inspiration for this play from one or other of two versions of caspar david friedrich’s painting two men contemplating the moon which he saw on a trip to germany in 1936 or ’37. in both versions of the painting one of the men has his hand on the other man’s shoulder, a sign of companionship if ever there was one. <line> <line>baudelaire quotes the french philosopher and moralist jean de la bruyère (or delabruyère, as the man signed himself), “what a great misfortune we cannot be alone,” as if to chastise anyone who wants to plunge into a crowd or go into a busy bar. what about the great french word fraternité, the third of the three words that were the rallying cry of the revolution? i want to close this by giving another quote from de la bruyère: “out of difficulties grow miracles.” i prefer this one. anyone in an awkward social situation should dwell on that. <line>","living,life choices,the mind,activities,eating & drinking,arts & sciences,philosophy,poetry & poets"

on his right the radiant image of his glory sat, his onely son; on earth he first beheld our two first parents, yet the onely two of mankind, in the happie garden plac't, reaping immortal fruits of joy and love, uninterrupted joy, unrivald love in blissful solitude; he then survey'd hell and the gulf between, and satan there coasting the wall of heav'n on this side night in the dun air sublime, and ready now to stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet on the bare outside of this world, that seem'd firm land imbosom'd without firmament, uncertain which, in ocean or in air. him god beholding from his prospect high, wherein past, present, future he beholds, thus to his onely son foreseeing spake. onely begotten son, seest thou what rage transports our adversarie, whom no bounds prescrib'd, no barrs of hell, nor all the chains heapt on him there, nor yet the main abyss wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems on desparate reveng, that shall redound upon his own rebellious head. and now through all restraint broke loose he wings his way not farr off heav'n, in the precincts of light, directly towards the new created world, and man there plac't, with purpose to assay if him by force he can destroy, or worse, by some false guile pervert; and shall pervert for man will hark'n to his glozing lyes, and easily transgress the sole command, sole pledge of his obedience: so will fall, hee and his faithless progenie: whose fault? whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee all he could have; i made him just and right, sufficient to have stood, though free to fall. such i created all th' ethereal powers and spirits, both them who stood and them who faild; freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell. not free, what proof could they have givn sincere of true allegiance, constant faith or love, where onely what they needs must do, appeard, not what they would? what praise could they receive? what pleasure i from such obedience paid, when will and reason (reason also is choice) useless and vain, of freedom both despoild, made passive both, had servd necessitie, not mee. they therefore as to right belongd, so were created, nor can justly accuse thir maker, or thir making, or thir fate, as if predestination over-rul'd thir will, dispos'd by absolute decree or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed thir own revolt, not i: if i foreknew, foreknowledge had no influence on their fault, which had no less prov'd certain unforeknown. so without least impulse or shadow of fate, or aught by me immutablie foreseen, they trespass, authors to themselves in all both what they judge and what they choose; for so i formd them free, and free they must remain, till they enthrall themselves: i else must change thir nature, and revoke the high decree unchangeable, eternal, which ordain'd thir freedom, they themselves ordain'd thir fall. the first sort by thir own suggestion fell, self-tempted, self-deprav'd: man falls deceiv'd by the other first: man therefore shall find grace, the other none: in mercy and justice both, through heav'n and earth, so shall my glorie excel, but mercy first and last shall brightest shine. thus while god spake, ambrosial fragrance fill'd all heav'n, and in the blessed spirits elect sense of new joy ineffable diffus'd: beyond compare the son of god was seen most glorious, in him all his father shon substantially express'd, and in his face divine compassion visibly appeerd, love without end, and without measure grace, which uttering thus he to his father spake. o father, gracious was that word which clos'd thy sovran sentence, that man should find grace; for which both heav'n and earth shall high extoll thy praises, with th' innumerable sound of hymns and sacred songs, wherewith thy throne encompass'd shall resound thee ever blest. for should man finally be lost, should man thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest son fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd with his own folly? that be from thee farr, that farr be from thee, father, who art judg of all things made, and judgest onely right. or shall the adversarie thus obtain his end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill his malice, and thy goodness bring to naught, or proud return though to his heavier doom, yet with revenge accomplish't and to hell draw after him the whole race of mankind, by him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self abolish thy creation, and unmake, for him, what for thy glorie thou hast made? so should thy goodness and thy greatness both be questiond and blaspheam'd without defence. to whom the great creatour thus reply'd. o son, in whom my soul hath chief delight, son of my bosom, son who art alone my word, my wisdom, and effectual might, all hast thou spok'n as my thoughts are, all as my eternal purpose hath decreed: man shall not quite be lost, but sav'd who will, yet not of will in him, but grace in me freely voutsaft; once more i will renew his lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall'd by sin to foul exorbitant desires; upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand on even ground against his mortal foe, by me upheld, that he may know how frail his fall'n condition is, and to me ow all his deliv'rance, and to none but me. some i have chosen of peculiar grace elect above the rest; so is my will: the rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd thir sinful state, and to appease betimes th' incensed deitie, while offerd grace invites; for i will cleer thir senses dark, what may sufflce, and soft'n stonie hearts to pray, repent, and bring obedience due. to prayer, repentance, and obedience due, though but endevord with sincere intent, mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut. and i will place within them as a guide my umpire conscience, whom if they will hear, light after light well us'd they shall attain, and to the end persisting, safe arrive. this my long sufferance and my day of grace they who neglect and scorn, shall never taste; but hard be hard'nd, blind be blinded more, that they may stumble on, and deeper fall; and none but such from mercy i exclude. but yet all is not don; man disobeying, disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns against the high supremacie of heav'n, affecting god-head, and so loosing all, to expiate his treason hath naught left, but to destruction sacred and devote, he with his whole posteritie must dye, dye hee or justice must; unless for him som other able, and as willing, pay the rigid satisfaction, death for death. say heav'nly powers, where shall we find such love, which of ye will be mortal to redeem mans mortal crime, and just th' unjust to save, dwels in all heaven charitie so deare? he ask'd, but all the heav'nly quire stood mute, and silence was in heav'n: on mans behalf patron or intercessor none appeerd, much less that durst upon his own head draw the deadly forfeiture, and ransom set. and now without redemption all mankind must have bin lost, adjudg'd to death and hell by doom severe, had not the son of god, in whom the fulness dwels of love divine, his dearest mediation thus renewd. father, thy word is past, man shall find grace; and shall grace not find means, that finds her way, the speediest of thy winged messengers, to visit all thy creatures, and to all comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought, happie for man, so coming; he her aide can never seek, once dead in sins and lost; attonement for himself or offering meet, indebted and undon, hath none to bring: behold mee then, mee for him, life for life i offer, on mee let thine anger fall; account mee man; i for his sake will leave thy bosom, and this glorie next to thee freely put off, and for him lastly dye well pleas'd, on me let death wreck all his rage; under his gloomie power i shall not long lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess life in my self for ever, by thee i live, though now to death i yield, and am his due all that of me can die, yet that debt paid, thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave his prey, nor suffer my unspotted soule for ever with corruption there to dwell; but i shall rise victorious, and subdue my vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile; death his deaths wound shall then receive, and stoop inglorious, of his mortall sting disarm'd. i through the ample air in triumph high shall lead hell captive maugre hell, and show the powers of darkness bound. thou at the sight pleas'd, out of heaven shalt look down and smile, while by thee rais'd i ruin all my foes, death last, and with his carcass glut the grave: then with the multitude of my redeemd shall enter heaven long absent, and returne, father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud of anger shall remain, but peace assur'd, and reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire. his words here ended, but his meek aspect silent yet spake, and breath'd immortal love to mortal men, above which only shon filial obedience: as a sacrifice glad to be offer'd, he attends the will of his great father. admiration seis'd all heav'n, what this might mean, and whither tend wondring; but soon th' almighty thus reply'd: o thou in heav'n and earth the only peace found out for mankind under wrauth, o thou my sole complacence! well thou know'st how dear, to me are all my works, nor man the least though last created, that for him i spare thee from my bosom and right hand, to save, by loosing thee a while, the whole race lost. thou therefore whom thou only canst redeem, thir nature also to thy nature joyn; and be thy self man among men on earth, made flesh, when time shall be, of virgin seed, by wondrous birth: be thou in adams room the head of all mankind, though adams son. as in him perish all men, so in thee as from a second root shall be restor'd, as many as are restor'd, without thee none. his crime makes guiltie all his sons, thy merit imputed shall absolve them who renounce thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds, and live in thee transplanted, and from thee receive new life. so man, as is most just, shall satisfie for man, be judg'd and die, and dying rise, and rising with him raise his brethren, ransomd with his own dear life. so heav'nly love shall outdoo hellish hate giving to death, and dying to redeeme, so dearly to redeem what hellish hate so easily destroy'd, and still destroyes in those who, when they may, accept not grace. nor shalt thou by descending to assume mans nature, less'n or degrade thine owne. because thou hast, though thron'd in highest bliss equal to god, and equally enjoying god-like fruition, quitted all to save a world from utter loss, and hast been found by merit more then birthright son of god, found worthiest to be so by being good, farr more then great or high; because in thee love hath abounded more then glory abounds, therefore thy humiliation shall exalt with thee thy manhood also to this throne; here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt reign both god and man, son both of god and man, anointed universal king, all power i give thee, reign for ever, and assume thy merits; under thee as head supream thrones, princedoms, powers, dominions i reduce: all knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide in heaven, or earth, or under earth in hell; when thou attended gloriously from heav'n shalt in the sky appeer, and from thee send the summoning arch-angels to proclaime thy dread tribunal: forthwith from all windes the living, and forthwith the cited dead of all past ages to the general doom shall hast'n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep. then all thy saints assembl'd, thou shalt judge bad men and angels, they arraignd shall sink beneath thy sentence; hell, her numbers full, thenceforth shall be for ever shut. mean while the world shall burn, and from her ashes spring new heav'n and earth, wherein the just shall dwell, and after all thir tribulations long see golden days, fruitful of golden deeds, with joy and love triumphing, and fair truth. then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by, for regal scepter then no more shall need, god shall be all in all. but all ye gods, adore him, who to compass all this dies, adore the son, and honour him as mee. no sooner had th' almighty ceas't, but all the multitude of angels with a shout loud as from numbers without number, sweet as from blest voices, uttering joy, heav'n rung with jubilee, and loud hosanna's filld th' eternal regions: lowly reverent towards either throne they bow, and to the ground with solemn adoration down they cast thir crowns inwove with amarant and gold, immortal amarant, a flour which once in paradise, fast by the tree of life began to bloom, but soon for mans offence to heav'n remov'd where first it grew, there grows, and flours aloft shading the fount of life, and where the river of bliss through midst of heavn rowls o're elisian flours her amber stream; with these that never fade the spirits elect bind thir resplendent locks inwreath'd with beams, now in loose garlands thick thrown off, the bright pavement that like a sea of jasper shon impurpl'd with celestial roses smil'd. then crown'd again thir gold'n harps they took, harps ever tun'd, that glittering by thir side like quivers hung, and with praeamble sweet of charming symphonie they introduce thir sacred song, and waken raptures high; no voice exempt, no voice but well could joine melodious part, such concord is in heav'n. thee father first they sung omnipotent, immutable, immortal, infinite, eternal king; thee author of all being, fountain of light, thy self invisible amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st thron'd inaccessible, but when thou shad'st the full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine, dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer, yet dazle heav'n, that brightest seraphim approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes. thee next they sang of all creation first, begotten son, divine similitude, in whose conspicuous count'nance, without cloud made visible, th' almighty father shines, whom else no creature can behold; on thee impresst the effulgence of his glorie abides, transfus'd on thee his ample spirit rests. hee heav'n of heavens and all the powers therein by thee created, and by thee threw down th' aspiring dominations: thou that day thy fathers dreadful thunder didst not spare, nor stop thy flaming chariot wheels, that shook heav'ns everlasting frame, while o're the necks thou drov'st of warring angels disarraid. back from pursuit thy powers with loud acclaime thee only extoll'd, son of thy fathers might, to execute fierce vengeance on his foes, not so on man; him through their malice fall'n, father of mercie and grace, thou didst not doome so strictly, but much more to pitie encline: no sooner did thy dear and onely son perceive thee purpos'd not to doom frail man so strictly, but much more to pitie enclin'd, he to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife of mercy and justice in thy face discern'd, regardless of the bliss wherein hee sat second to thee, offerd himself to die for mans offence. o unexampl'd love, love no where to be found less then divine! hail son of god, saviour of men, thy name shall be the copious matter of my song henceforth, and never shall my harp thy praise forget, nor from thy fathers praise disjoine. thus they in heav'n, above the starry sphear, thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent. mean while upon the firm opacous globe of this round world, whose first convex divides the luminous inferior orbs, enclos'd from chaos and th' inroad of darkness old, satan alighted walks: a globe farr off it seem'd, now seems a boundless continent dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of night starless expos'd, and ever-threatning storms of chaos blustring round, inclement skie; save on that side which from the wall of heav'n though distant farr som small reflection gaines of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud: here walk'd the fiend at large in spacious field. as when a vultur on imaus bred, whose snowie ridge the roving tartar bounds, dislodging from a region scarce of prey to gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids on hills where flocks are fed, flies toward the springs of ganges or hydaspes, indian streams; but in his way lights on the barren plaines of sericana, where chineses drive with sails and wind thir canie waggons light: so on this windie sea of land, the fiend walk'd up and down alone bent on his prey, alone, for other creature in this place living or liveless to be found was none, none yet, but store hereafter from the earth up hither like aereal vapours flew of all things transitorie and vain, when sin with vanity had filld the works of men: both all things vain, and all who in vain things built thir fond hopes of glorie or lasting fame, or happiness in this or th' other life; all who have thir reward on earth, the fruits of painful superstition and blind zeal, naught seeking but the praise of men, here find fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds; all th, unaccomplisht works of natures hand, abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt, dissolvd on earth, fleet hither, and in vain, till final dissolution, wander here, not in the neighbouring moon, as some have dreamd; those argent fields more likely habitants, translated saints, or middle spirits hold betwixt th' angelical and human kinde: hither of ill-joynd sons and daughters born first from the ancient world those giants came with many a vain exploit, though then renownd: the builders next of babel on the plain of sennaar, and still with vain designe new babels, had they wherewithall, would build: others came single; he who to be deemd a god, leap'd fondly into aetna flames, empedocles, and hee who to enjoy plato's elysium, leap'd into the sea, cleombrotus, and many more too long, embryo's and idiots, eremits and friers white, black and grey, with all thir trumperie. here pilgrims roam, that stray'd so farr to seek in golgotha him dead, who lives in heav'n; and they who to be sure of paradise dying put on the weeds of dominic, or in franciscan think to pass disguis'd; they pass the planets seven, and pass the fixt, and that crystalline sphear whose ballance weighs the trepidation talkt, and that first mov'd; and now saint peter at heav'ns wicket seems to wait them with his keys, and now at foot of heav'ns ascent they lift thir feet, when loe a violent cross wind from either coast blows them transverse ten thousand leagues awry into the devious air; then might ye see cowles, hoods and habits with thir wearers tost and flutterd into raggs, then reliques, beads, indulgences, dispenses, pardons, bulls, the sport of winds: all these upwhirld aloft fly o're the backside of the world farr off into a limbo large and broad, since calld the paradise of fools, to few unknown long after, now unpeopl'd, and untrod; all this dark globe the fiend found as he pass'd, and long he wanderd, till at last a gleame of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste his travell'd steps; farr distant he descries ascending by degrees magnificent up to the wall of heaven a structure high, at top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd the work as of a kingly palace gate with frontispice of diamond and gold imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient gemmes the portal shon, inimitable on earth by model, or by shading pencil drawn. the stairs were such as whereon jacob saw angels ascending and descending, bands of guardians bright, when he from esau fled to padan-aram in the field of luz, dreaming by night under the open skie, and waking cri'd, this is the gate of heav'n. each stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood there alwayes, but drawn up to heav'n somtimes viewless, and underneath a bright sea flow'd of jasper, or of liquid pearle, whereon who after came from earth, sayling arriv'd, wafted by angels, or flew o're the lake rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds. the stairs were then let down, whether to dare the fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate his sad exclusion from the dores of bliss. direct against which op'nd from beneath, just o're the blissful seat of paradise, a passage down to th' earth, a passage wide, wider by farr then that of after-times over mount sion, and, though that were large, over the promis'd land to god so dear, by which, to visit oft those happy tribes, on high behests his angels to and fro pass'd frequent, and his eye with choice regard from paneas the fount of jordans flood to beersaba, where the holy land borders on aegypt and the arabian shoare; so wide the op'ning seemd, where bounds were set to darkness, such as bound the ocean wave. satan from hence now on the lower stair that scal'd by steps of gold to heav'n gate looks down with wonder at the sudden view of all this world at once. as when a scout through dark and desart wayes with peril gone all night; at last by break of chearful dawne obtains the brow of some high-climbing hill, which to his eye discovers unaware the goodly prospect of some forein land first-seen, or some renown'd metropolis with glistering spires and pinnacles adornd, which now the rising sun guilds with his beams. such wonder seis'd, though after heaven seen, the spirit maligne, but much more envy seis'd at sight of all this world beheld so faire. round he surveys, and well might, where he stood so high above the circling canopie of nights extended shade; from eastern point of libra to the fleecie starr that bears andromeda farr off atlantic seas beyond th' horizon; then from pole to pole he views in bredth, and without longer pause down right into the worlds first region throws his flight precipitant, and windes with ease through the pure marble air his oblique way amongst innumerable starrs, that shon stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other worlds, or other worlds they seemd, or happy iles, like those hesperian gardens fam'd of old, fortunate fields, and groves and flourie vales, thrice happy iles, but who dwelt happy there he stayd not to enquire: above them all the golden sun in splendor likest heaven allur'd his eye: thither his course he bends through the calm firmament; but up or downe by center, or eccentric, hard to tell, or longitude, where the great luminarie alooff the vulgar constellations thick, that from his lordly eye keep distance due, dispenses light from farr; they as they move thir starry dance in numbers that compute days, months, & years, towards his all-chearing lamp turn swift thir various motions, or are turnd by his magnetic beam, that gently warms the univers, and to each inward part with gentle penetration, though unseen, shoots invisible vertue even to the deep: so wondrously was set his station bright. there lands the fiend, a spot like which perhaps astronomer in the sun's lucent orbe through his glaz'd optic tube yet never saw. the place he found beyond expression bright, compar'd with aught on earth, medal or stone; not all parts like, but all alike informd with radiant light, as glowing iron with fire; if mettal, part seemd gold, part silver cleer; if stone, carbuncle most or chrysolite, rubie or topaz, to the twelve that shon in aarons brest-plate, and a stone besides imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen, that stone, or like to that which here below philosophers in vain so long have sought, in vain, though by thir powerful art they binde volatil hermes, and call up unbound in various shapes old proteus from the sea, draind through a limbec to his native forme. what wonder then if fields and regions here breathe forth elixir pure, and rivers run potable gold, when with one vertuous touch th' arch-chimic sun so farr from us remote produces with terrestrial humor mixt here in the dark so many precious things of colour glorious and effect so rare? here matter new to gaze the devil met undazl'd, farr and wide his eye commands, for sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, but all sun-shine, as when his beams at noon culminate from th' aequator, as they now shot upward still direct, whence no way round shadow from body opaque can fall, and the aire, no where so cleer, sharp'nd his visual ray to objects distant farr, whereby he soon saw within kenn a glorious angel stand, the same whom john saw also in the sun: his back was turnd, but not his brightness hid; of beaming sunnie raies, a golden tiar circl'd his head, nor less his locks behind illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings lay waving round; on som great charge imploy'd he seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep. glad was the spirit impure as now in hope to find who might direct his wandring flight to paradise the happie seat of man, his journies end and our beginning woe. but first he casts to change his proper shape, which else might work him danger or delay: and now a stripling cherube he appeers, not of the prime, yet such as in his face youth smil'd celestial, and to every limb sutable grace diffus'd, so well he feignd; under a coronet his flowing haire in curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore of many a colourd plume sprinkl'd with gold, his habit fit for speed succinct, and held before his decent steps a silver wand. he drew not nigh unheard, the angel bright, ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd, admonisht by his ear, and strait was known th' arch-angel uriel, one of the seav'n who in gods presence, neerest to his throne stand ready at command, and are his eyes that run through all the heav'ns, or down to th' earth bear his swift errands over moist and dry, o're sea and land: him satan thus accostes; uriel, for thou of those seav'n spirits that stand in sight of god's high throne, gloriously bright, the first art wont his great authentic will interpreter through highest heav'n to bring, where all his sons thy embassie attend; and here art likeliest by supream decree like honour to obtain, and as his eye to visit oft this new creation round; unspeakable desire to see, and know all these his wondrous works, but chiefly man, his chief delight and favour, him for whom all these his works so wondrous he ordaind, hath brought me from the quires of cherubim alone thus wandring. brightest seraph tell in which of all these shining orbes hath man his fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none, but all these shining orbes his choice to dwell; that i may find him, and with secret gaze, or open admiration him behold on whom the great creator hath bestowd worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd; that both in him and all things, as is meet, the universal maker we may praise; who justly hath drivn out his rebell foes to deepest hell, and to repair that loss created this new happie race of men to serve him better: wise are all his wayes. so spake the false dissembler unperceivd; for neither man nor angel can discern hypocrisie, the onely evil that walks invisible, except to god alone, by his permissive will, through heav'n and earth: and oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps at wisdoms gate, and to simplicitie resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill where no ill seems: which now for once beguil'd uriel, though regent of the sun, and held the sharpest sighted spirit of all in heav'n; who to the fraudulent impostor foule in his uprightness answer thus returnd. fair angel, thy desire which tends to know the works of god, thereby to glorifie the great work-maister, leads to no excess that reaches blame, but rather merits praise the more it seems excess, that led thee hither from thy empyreal mansion thus alone, to witness with thine eyes what some perhaps contented with report hear onely in heav'n: for wonderful indeed are all his works, pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all had in remembrance alwayes with delight; but what created mind can comprehend thir number, or the wisdom infinite that brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep. i saw when at his word the formless mass, this worlds material mould, came to a heap: confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar stood rul'd, stood vast infinitude confin'd; till at his second bidding darkness fled, light shon, and order from disorder sprung: swift to thir several quarters hasted then the cumbrous elements, earth, flood, aire, fire, and this ethereal quintessence of heav'n flew upward, spirited with various forms, that rowld orbicular, and turnd to starrs numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; each had his place appointed, each his course, the rest in circuit walles this universe. look downward on that globe whose hither side with light from hence, though but reflected, shines; that place is earth the seat of man, that light his day, which else as th' other hemisphere night would invade, but there the neighbouring moon (so call that opposite fair starr) her aide timely interposes, and her monthly round still ending, still renewing, through mid heav'n;

10782,6933,"<line> <line>1 sometime now past in the autumnal tide, when phoebus wanted but one hour to bed, the trees all richly clad, yet void of pride, were gilded o’re by his rich golden head. their leaves and fruits seem’d painted but was true of green, of red, of yellow, mixed hew, rapt were my senses at this delectable view. 2 i wist not what to wish, yet sure thought i, if so much excellence abide below, how excellent is he that dwells on high? whose power and beauty by his works we know. sure he is goodness, wisdom, glory, light, that hath this under world so richly dight. more heaven than earth was here, no winter and no night. 3 then on a stately oak i cast mine eye, whose ruffling top the clouds seem’d to aspire; how long since thou wast in thine infancy? thy strength and stature, more thy years admire, hath hundred winters past since thou wast born? or thousand since thou brakest thy shell of horn, if so, all these as nought, eternity doth scorn. 4 then higher on the glistering sun i gaz’d, whose beams was shaded by the leafy tree. the more i look’d, the more i grew amaz’d and softly said, what glory’s like to thee? soul of this world, this universe’s eye, no wonder some made thee a deity: had i not better known (alas) the same had i. 5 thou as a bridegroom from thy chamber rushes and as a strong man joys to run a race. the morn doth usher thee with smiles and blushes. the earth reflects her glances in thy face. birds, insects, animals with vegative, thy heat from death and dullness doth revive: and in the darksome womb of fruitful nature dive. 6 thy swift annual and diurnal course, thy daily straight and yearly oblique path, thy pleasing fervour, and thy scorching force, all mortals here the feeling knowledge hath. thy presence makes it day, thy absence night, quaternal seasons caused by thy might: hail creature, full of sweetness, beauty, and delight. 7 art thou so full of glory that no eye hath strength thy shining rays once to behold? and is thy splendid throne erect so high? as, to approach it, can no earthly mould. how full of glory then must thy creator be? who gave this bright light luster unto thee: admir’d, ador’d for ever be that majesty. 8 silent alone where none or saw, or heard, in pathless paths i lead my wand’ring feet. my humble eyes to lofty skies i rear’d to sing some song my mazed muse thought meet. my great creator i would magnifie, that nature had thus decked liberally: but ah and ah again, my imbecility! 9 i heard the merry grasshopper then sing, the black clad cricket bear a second part. they kept one tune and played on the same string, seeming to glory in their little art. shall creatures abject thus their voices raise? and in their kind resound their maker’s praise: whilst i, as mute, can warble forth no higher layes. 10 when present times look back to ages past and men in being fancy those are dead, it makes things gone perpetually to last and calls back months and years that long since fled it makes a man more aged in conceit, than was methuselah or’s grand-sire great: while of their persons and their acts his mind doth treat. 11 sometimes in eden fair he seems to be, see glorious adam there made lord of all, fancies the apple, dangle on the tree, that turn’d his sovereign to a naked thrall, who like a miscreant’s driven from that place to get his bread with pain and sweat of face: a penalty impos’d on his backsliding race. 12 here sits our grandame in retired place, and in her lap her bloody cain new born, the weeping imp oft looks her in the face, bewails his unknown hap and fate forlorn; his mother sighs to think of paradise, and how she lost her bliss, to be more wise, believing him that was, and is, father of lyes. 13 here cain and abel come to sacrifice, fruits of the earth and fatlings each do bring, on abels gift the fire descends from skies, but no such sign on false cain’s offering; with sullen hateful looks he goes his wayes. hath thousand thoughts to end his brothers dayes, upon whose blood his future good he hopes to raise. 14 there abel keeps his sheep, no ill he thinks, his brother comes, then acts his fratricide. the virgin earth of blood her first draught drinks, but since that time she often hath been cloy’d; the wretch with ghastly face and dreadful mind, thinks each he sees will serve him in his kind, though none on earth but kindred near then could he find. 15 who fancies not his looks now at the barr, his face like death, his heart with horror fraught, nor male-factor ever felt like warr, when deep despair with wish of life hath fought, branded with guilt, and crusht with treble woes, a vagabond to land of nod he goes. a city builds, that wals might him secure from foes. 16 who thinks not oft upon the fathers ages. their long descent, how nephews sons they saw, the starry observations of those sages, and how their precepts to their sons were law, how adam sigh’d to see his progeny, cloath’d all in his black, sinful livery, who neither guilt not yet the punishment could fly. 17 our life compare we with their length of dayes who to the tenth of theirs doth now arrive? and though thus short, we shorten many wayes, living so little while we are alive; in eating, drinking, sleeping, vain delight so unawares comes on perpetual night, and puts all pleasures vain unto eternal flight. 18 when i behold the heavens as in their prime, and then the earth (though old) still clad in green, the stones and trees, insensible of time, nor age nor wrinkle on their front are seen; if winter come, and greenness then do fade, a spring returns, and they more youthfull made; but man grows old, lies down, remains where once he’s laid. 19 by birth more noble than those creatures all, yet seems by nature and by custom curs’d, no sooner born, but grief and care makes fall that state obliterate he had at first: nor youth, nor strength, nor wisdom spring again nor habitations long their names retain, but in oblivion to the final day remain. 20 shall i then praise the heavens, the trees, the earth because their beauty and their strength last longer shall i wish there, or never to had birth, because they’re bigger and their bodyes stronger? nay, they shall darken, perish, fade and dye, and when unmade, so ever shall they lye, but man was made for endless immortality. 21 under the cooling shadow of a stately elm close sate i by a goodly rivers side, where gliding streams the rocks did overwhelm; a lonely place, with pleasures dignifi’d. i once that lov’d the shady woods so well, now thought the rivers did the trees excel, and if the sun would ever shine, there would i dwell. 22 while on the stealing stream i fixt mine eye, which to the long’d-for ocean held its course, i markt, nor crooks, nor rubs that there did lye could hinder ought but still augment its force: o happy flood, quoth i, that holds thy race till thou arrive at thy beloved place, nor is it rocks or shoals that can obstruct thy pace. 23 nor is’t enough that thou alone may’st slide, but hundred brooks in thy cleer waves do meet, so hand in hand along with thee they glide to thetis house, where all imbrace and greet: thou emblem true of what i count the best, o could i lead my rivolets to rest, so may we press to that vast mansion, ever blest. 24 ye fish which in this liquid region ’bide that for each season have your habitation, now salt, now fresh where you think best to glide to unknown coasts to give a visitation, in lakes and ponds, you leave your numerous fry, so nature taught, and yet you know not why, you watry folk that know not your felicity. 25 look how the wantons frisk to tast the air, then to the colder bottome streight they dive, eftsoon to neptun’s glassy hall repair to see what trade they, great ones, there do drive, who forrage o’re the spacious sea-green field, and take the trembling prey before it yield, whose armour is their scales, their spreading fins their shield. 26 while musing thus with contemplation fed, and thousand fancies buzzing in my brain, the sweet-tongu’d philomel percht ore my head, and chanted forth a most melodious strain which rapt me so with wonder and delight, i judg’d my hearing better than my sight, and wisht me wings with her a while to take my flight. 27 o merry bird (said i) that fears no snares, that neither toyles nor hoards up in thy barn, feels no sad thoughts, nor cruciating cares to gain more good, or shun what might thee harm thy clothes ne’re wear, thy meat is every where, thy bed a bough, thy drink the water cleer, reminds not what is past, nor whats to come dost fear. 28 the dawning morn with songs thou dost prevent, sets hundred notes unto thy feathered crew, so each one tunes his pretty instrument, and warbling out the old, begin anew, and thus they pass their youth in summer season, then follow thee into a better region, where winter’s never felt by that sweet airy legion. 29 man at the best a creature frail and vain, in knowledge ignorant, in strength but weak, subject to sorrows, losses, sickness, pain, each storm his state, his mind, his body break, from some of these he never finds cessation, but day or night, within, without, vexation, troubles from foes, from friends, from dearest, near’st relation. 30 and yet this sinfull creature, frail and vain, this lump of wretchedness, of sin and sorrow, this weather-beaten vessel wrackt with pain, joys not in hope of an eternal morrow; nor all his losses, crosses and vexation, in weight, in frequency and long duration can make him deeply groan for that divine translation. 31 the mariner that on smooth waves doth glide, sings merrily and steers his barque with ease, as if he had command of wind and tide, and now becomes great master of the seas; but suddenly a storm spoils all the sport, and makes him long for a more quiet port, which ’gainst all adverse winds may serve for fort. 32 so he that faileth in this world of pleasure, feeding on sweets, that never bit of th’ sowre, that’s full of friends, of honour and of treasure, fond fool, he takes this earth ev’n for heav’ns bower, but sad affliction comes and makes him see here’s neither honour, wealth, nor safety; only above is found all with security. 33 o time the fatal wrack of mortal things, that draws oblivions curtains over kings, their sumptuous monuments, men know them not, their names without a record are forgot, their parts, their ports, their pomp’s all laid in th’ dust. nor wit, nor gold, nor buildings scape times rust; but he whose name is grav’d in the white stone shall last and shine when all of these are gone. <line>","living,death,growing old,time & brevity,nature,fall,trees & flowers,arts & sciences,philosophy"

(you see there is always the detail of iku being overprotective. the relationship is like playing with a leopard—even an affectionate jab with its paw will cause a scar). the head will also have to be ritually prepared & fed with bits of white fruit among other ingredients & thus given a firm root, stability—“para que su cabeza no esté en el aire,” he said. <line> <line> <line>we were witness to this event. we heard what needed to be done. there was actually a time, maybe this is still going on, when people consulted with the spirit world, the other world, on such occasions as the third month after birth. we collected the ingredients that would shape his destiny & began to assemble them. much of them were from the river, the jungle, & of course, the cemetery. we heard what needed to <line> <line> <line>be done. <line> <line> <line>ara orun are hip to the images & subtle rhythms that stories & verses evoke. the same images & subtle rhythms running through our lives. edikán said that barring some details of modernity, his life would follow a certain ancient story pertaining to the divination— <line> <line> <line>ofun is like this/ <line> <line> <line>ofun ni jé bé— <line> <line> <line>the page continues to turn.the rhythm, the rhythm <line> <line> <line>will come from dreams. <line> <line> <line> <line>","living,time & brevity,relationships,family & ancestors,religion,other religions,mythology & folklore,fairy-tales & legends"

""only a very little, mr. flood— for auld lang syne. no more, sir; that will do."" so, for the time, apparently it did, and eben evidently thought so too; for soon amid the silver loneliness of night he lifted up his voice and sang, secure, with only two moons listening, until the whole harmonious landscape rang— ""for auld lang syne."" the weary throat gave out, the last word wavered; and the song being done, he raised again the jug regretfully and shook his head, and was again alone. there was not much that was ahead of him, and there was nothing in the town below— where strangers would have shut the many doors that many friends had opened long ago. <line>","living,disappointment & failure,growing old,time & brevity,activities,eating & drinking,new year"
