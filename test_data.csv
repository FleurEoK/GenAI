""for poetry he's past his prime: he takes an hour to find a rhyme; his fire is out, his wit decay'd, his fancy sunk, his muse a jade. i'd have him throw away his pen;— but there's no talking to some men!"" and then their tenderness appears, by adding largely to my years: ""he's older than he would be reckon'd and well remembers charles the second. ""he hardly drinks a pint of wine; and that, i doubt, is no good sign. his stomach too begins to fail: last year we thought him strong and hale; but now he's quite another thing: i wish he may hold out till spring."" then hug themselves, and reason thus: ""it is not yet so bad with us."" in such a case, they talk in tropes, and by their fears express their hopes: some great misfortune to portend, no enemy can match a friend. with all the kindness they profess, the merit of a lucky guess (when daily ""how d'ye's"" come of course, and servants answer, ""worse and worse!"") would please 'em better, than to tell, that, ""god be prais'd, the dean is well."" then he who prophecy'd the best approves his foresight to the rest: ""you know i always fear'd the worst, and often told you so at first."" he'd rather choose that i should die, than his prediction prove a lie. not one foretells i shall recover; but all agree to give me over. yet, should some neighbour feel a pain just in the parts where i complain, how many a message would he send? what hearty prayers that i should mend? inquire what regimen i kept, what gave me ease, and how i slept? and more lament when i was dead, than all the sniv'llers round my bed. my good companions, never fear; for though you may mistake a year, though your prognostics run too fast, they must be verify'd at last. behold the fatal day arrive!

'tis time he should. he's dead, you say; why, let him rot: i'm glad the medals were forgot. i promis'd them, i own; but when? i only was the princess then; but now, as consort of a king, you know, 'tis quite a different thing."" now chartres, at sir robert's levee, tells with a sneer the tidings heavy: ""why, is he dead without his shoes?"" cries bob, ""i'm sorry for the news: o, were the wretch but living still, and in his place my good friend will! or had a mitre on his head, provided bolingbroke were dead!"" now curll his shop from rubbish drains: three genuine tomes of swift's remains! and then, to make them pass the glibber, revis'd by tibbalds, moore, and cibber. he'll treat me as he does my betters, publish my will, my life, my letters: revive the libels born to die; which pope must bear, as well as i. here shift the scene, to represent how those i love my death lament. poor pope will grieve a month, and gay a week, and arbuthnot a day. st. john himself will scarce forbear to bite his pen, and drop a tear. the rest will give a shrug, and cry, ""i'm sorry—but we all must die!"" indifference, clad in wisdom's guise, all fortitude of mind supplies: for how can stony bowels melt in those who never pity felt? when we are lash'd, they kiss the rod, resigning to the will of god. the fools, my juniors by a year, are tortur'd with suspense and fear; who wisely thought my age a screen, when death approach'd, to stand between: the screen remov'd, their hearts are trembling; they mourn for me without dissembling. my female friends, whose tender hearts have better learn'd to act their parts, receive the news in doleful dumps: ""the dean is dead: (and what is trumps?) then, lord have mercy on his soul! (ladies, i'll venture for the vole.) six deans, they say, must bear the pall: (i wish i knew what king to call.) madam, your husband will attend the funeral of so good a friend. no, madam, 'tis a shocking sight: and he's engag'd to-morrow night: my lady club would take it ill, if he should fail her at quadrille. he lov'd the dean—(i lead a heart) but dearest friends, they say, must part. his time was come: he ran his race; we hope he's in a better place."" why do we grieve that friends should die? no loss more easy to supply. one year is past; a different scene! no further mention of the dean; who now, alas! no more is miss'd, than if he never did exist. where's now this fav'rite of apollo! departed:—and his works must follow; must undergo the common fate; his kind of wit is out of date. some country squire to lintot goes, inquires for ""swift in verse and prose."" says lintot, ""i have heard the name; he died a year ago.""—""the same."" he searcheth all his shop in vain. ""sir, you may find them in duck-lane; i sent them with a load of books, last monday to the pastry-cook's. to fancy they could live a year! i find you're but a stranger here. the dean was famous in his time, and had a kind of knack at rhyme. his way of writing now is past; the town hath got a better taste; i keep no antiquated stuff, but spick and span i have enough. pray do but give me leave to show 'em; here's colley cibber's birth-day poem. this ode you never yet have seen, by stephen duck, upon the queen. then here's a letter finely penn'd against the craftsman and his friend: it clearly shows that all reflection on ministers is disaffection. next, here's sir robert's vindication, and mr. henley's last oration. the hawkers have not got 'em yet: your honour please to buy a set? ""here's woolston's tracts, the twelfth edition; 'tis read by every politician: the country members, when in town, to all their boroughs send them down; you never met a thing so smart; the courtiers have them all by heart: those maids of honour who can read are taught to use them for their creed. the rev'rend author's good intention hath been rewarded with a pension. he doth an honour to his gown, by bravely running priestcraft down: he shows, as sure as god's in gloucester, that jesus was a grand imposter; that all his miracles were cheats, perform'd as jugglers do their feats: the church had never such a writer; a shame he hath not got a mitre!"" suppose me dead; and then suppose a club assembled at the rose ; where, from discourse of this and that, i grow the subject of their chat. and while they toss my name about, with favour some, and some without, one, quite indiff'rent in the cause, my character impartial draws: ""the dean, if we believe report, was never ill receiv'd at court. as for his works in verse and prose i own myself no judge of those; nor can i tell what critics thought 'em: but this i know, all people bought 'em. as with a moral view design'd to cure the vices of mankind: his vein, ironically grave, expos'd the fool, and lash'd the knave. to steal a hint was never known, but what he writ was all his own. ""he never thought an honour done him, because a duke was proud to own him, would rather slip aside and choose to talk with wits in dirty shoes; despis'd the fools with stars and garters, so often seen caressing chartres. he never courted men in station, nor persons held in admiration; of no man's greatness was afraid, because he sought for no man's aid. though trusted long in great affairs he gave himself no haughty airs: without regarding private ends, spent all his credit for his friends; and only chose the wise and good; no flatt'rers; no allies in blood: but succour'd virtue in distress, and seldom fail'd of good success; as numbers in their hearts must own, who, but for him, had been unknown. ""with princes kept a due decorum, but never stood in awe before 'em. he follow'd david's lesson just: 'in princes never put thy trust'; and, would you make him truly sour, provoke him with a slave in pow'r. the irish senate if you nam'd, with what impatience he declaim'd! fair liberty was all his cry, for her he stood prepar'd to die; for her he boldly stood alone; for her he oft expos'd his own. two kingdoms, just as faction led, had set a price upon his head; but not a traitor could be found to sell him for six hundred pound. ""had he but spar'd his tongue and pen he might have rose like other men: but pow'r was never in his thought, and wealth he valu'd not a groat: ingratitude he often found, and pity'd those who meant the wound: but kept the tenor of his mind, to merit well of human kind: nor made a sacrifice of those who still were true, to please his foes. he labour'd many a fruitless hour to reconcile his friends in pow'r; saw mischief by a faction brewing, while they pursu'd each other's ruin. but, finding vain was all his care, he left the court in mere despair. ""and, oh! how short are human schemes! here ended all our golden dreams. what st. john's skill in state affairs, what ormond's valour, oxford's cares, to save their sinking country lent, was all destroy'd by one event. too soon that precious life was ended, on which alone our weal depended. when up a dangerous faction starts, with wrath and vengeance in their hearts; by solemn league and cov'nant bound, to ruin, slaughter, and confound; to turn religion to a fable, and make the government a babel; pervert the law, disgrace the gown, corrupt the senate, rob the crown; to sacrifice old england's glory, and make her infamous in story: when such a tempest shook the land, how could unguarded virtue stand? ""with horror, grief, despair, the dean beheld the dire destructive scene: his friends in exile, or the tower, himself within the frown of power, pursu'd by base envenom'd pens, far to the land of slaves and fens; a servile race in folly nurs'd, who truckle most when treated worst. ""by innocence and resolution, he bore continual persecution, while numbers to preferment rose, whose merits were, to be his foes; when ev'n his own familiar friends, intent upon their private ends, like renegadoes now he feels, against him lifting up their heels. ""the dean did by his pen defeat an infamous destructive cheat; taught fools their int'rest how to know, and gave them arms to ward the blow. envy hath own'd it was his doing, to save that helpless land from ruin; while they who at the steerage stood, and reap'd the profit, sought his blood. ""to save them from their evil fate, in him was held a crime of state. a wicked monster on the bench, whose fury blood could never quench, as vile and profligate a villain, as modern scroggs, or old tresilian, who long all justice had discarded, nor fear'd he god, nor man regarded, vow'd on the dean his rage to vent, and make him of his zeal repent; but heav'n his innocence defends, the grateful people stand his friends. not strains of law, nor judge's frown, nor topics brought to please the crown, nor witness hir'd, nor jury pick'd, prevail to bring him in convict. ""in exile, with a steady heart, he spent his life's declining part; where folly, pride, and faction sway, remote from st. john, pope, and gay. ""his friendships there, to few confin'd, were always of the middling kind; no fools of rank, a mongrel breed, who fain would pass for lords indeed: where titles gave no right or power and peerage is a wither'd flower; he would have held it a disgrace, if such a wretch had known his face. on rural squires, that kingdom's bane, he vented oft his wrath in vain; biennial squires to market brought; who sell their souls and votes for nought; the nation stripp'd, go joyful back, to rob the church, their tenants rack, go snacks with thieves and rapparees, and keep the peace to pick up fees; in ev'ry job to have a share, a jail or barrack to repair; and turn the tax for public roads, commodious to their own abodes. ""perhaps i may allow, the dean had too much satire in his vein; and seem'd determin'd not to starve it, because no age could more deserve it. yet malice never was his aim; he lash'd the vice, but spar'd the name; no individual could resent, where thousands equally were meant. his satire points at no defect, but what all mortals may correct; for he abhorr'd that senseless tribe who call it humour when they gibe. he spar'd a hump, or crooked nose, whose owners set not up for beaux. true genuine dulness mov'd his pity, unless it offer'd to be witty. those who their ignorance confess'd he ne'er offended with a jest; but laugh'd to hear an idiot quote a verse from horace, learn'd by rote. ""he knew a hundred pleasant stories with all the turns of whigs and tories: was cheerful to his dying day; and friends would let him have his way. ""he gave the little wealth he had to build a house for fools and mad; and show'd by one satiric touch, no nation wanted it so much. that kingdom he hath left his debtor, i wish it soon may have a better."" <line>","living,death,arts & sciences,humor & satire"

9157,13669,"<line> <line>some days i catch a rhythm, almost a song in my own breath. i'm alone here in brooklyn heights, late morning, the sky above the st. george hotel clear, clear for new york, that is. the radio playing ""bird flight,"" parker in his california tragic voice fifty years ago, his faltering ""lover man"" just before he crashed into chaos. i would guess that outside the recording studio in burbank the sun was high above the jacarandas, it was late march, the worst of yesterday's rain had come and gone, the sky washed blue. bird could have seen for miles if he'd looked, but what he saw was so foreign he clenched his eyes, shook his head, and barked like a dog—just once— and then howard mcghee took his arm and assured him he'd be ok. i know this because howard told me years later that he thought bird could lie down in the hotel room they shared, sleep for an hour or more, and waken as himself. the perfect sunlight angles into my little room above willow street. i listen to my breath come and go and try to catch its curious taste, part milk, part iron, part blood, as it passes from me into the world. this is not me, this is automatic, this entering and exiting, my body's essential occupation without which i am a thing. the whole process has a name, a word i don't know, an elegant word not in english or yiddish or spanish, a word that means nothing to me. howard truly believed what he said that day when he steered parker into a cab and drove the silent miles beside him while the bright world unfurled around them: filling stations, stands of fruits and vegetables, a kiosk selling trinkets from mexico and the philippines. it was all so actual and western, it was a new creation coming into being, like the music of charlie parker someone later called ""glad,"" though that day i would have said silent, ""the silent music of charlie parker."" howard said nothing. he paid the driver and helped bird up two flights to their room, got his boots off, and went out to let him sleep as the afternoon entered the history of darkness. i'm not judging howard, he did better than i could have now or then. then i was 19, working on the loading docks at railway express, coming day by day into the damaged body of a man while i sang into the filthy air the yiddish drinking songs my zadie taught me before his breath failed. now howard is gone, eleven long years gone, the sweet voice silenced. ""the subtle bridge between eldridge and navarro,"" they later wrote, all that rising passion a footnote to others. i remember in '85 walking the halls of cass tech, the high school where he taught after his performing days, when suddenly he took my left hand in his two hands to tell me it all worked out for the best. maybe he'd gotten religion, maybe he knew how little time was left, maybe that day he was just worn down by my questions about parker. to him bird was truly charlie parker, a man, a silent note going out forever on the breath of genius which now i hear soaring above my own breath as this bright morning fades into afternoon. music, i'll call it music. it's what we need as the sun staggers behind the low gray clouds blowing relentlessly in from that nameless ocean, the calm and endless one i've still to cross. <line>","living,growing old,relationships,friends & enemies,arts & sciences,music"

9160,897,"<line> <line>meanwhile the hainous and despightfull act of satan done in paradise, and how hee in the serpent, had perverted eve, her husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit, was known in heav'n; for what can scape the eye of god all-seeing, or deceave his heart omniscient, who in all things wise and just, hinder'd not satan to attempt the minde of man, with strength entire, and free will arm'd, complete to have discover'd and repulst whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend. for still they knew, and ought to have still remember'd the high injunction not to taste that fruit, whoever tempted; which they not obeying, incurr'd, what could they less, the penaltie, and manifold in sin, deserv'd to fall. up into heav'n from paradise in haste th' angelic guards ascended, mute and sad for man, for of his state by this they knew, much wondring how the suttle fiend had stoln entrance unseen. soon as th' unwelcome news from earth arriv'd at heaven gate, displeas'd all were who heard, dim sadness did not spare that time celestial visages, yet mixt with pitie, violated not thir bliss. about the new-arriv'd, in multitudes th' ethereal people ran, to hear and know how all befell: they towards the throne supream accountable made haste to make appear with righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance, and easily approv'd; when the most high eternal father from his secret cloud, amidst in thunder utter'd thus his voice. assembl'd angels, and ye powers return'd from unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid, nor troubl'd at these tidings from the earth, which your sincerest care could not prevent, foretold so lately what would come to pass, when first this tempter cross'd the gulf from hell. i told ye then he should prevail and speed on his bad errand, man should be seduc't and flatter'd out of all, believing lies against his maker; no decree of mine concurring to necessitate his fall, or touch with lightest moment of impulse his free will, to her own inclining left in eevn scale. but fall'n he is, and now what rests but that the mortal sentence pass on his transgression, death denounc't that day, which he presumes already vain and void, because not yet inflicted, as he fear'd, by some immediate stroak; but soon shall find forbearance no acquittance ere day end. justice shall not return as bountie scorn'd. but whom send i to judge them? whom but thee vicegerent son, to thee i have transferr'd all judgement, whether in heav'n, or earth, or hell. easie it might be seen that i intend mercie collegue with justice, sending thee mans friend, his mediator, his design'd both ransom and redeemer voluntarie, and destin'd man himself to judge man fall'n. so spake the father, and unfoulding bright toward the right hand his glorie, on the son blaz'd forth unclouded deitie; he full resplendent all his father manifest express'd, and thus divinely answer'd milde. father eternal, thine is to decree, mine both in heav'n and earth to do thy will supream, that thou in mee thy son belov'd mayst ever rest well pleas'd. i go to judge on earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst, whoever judg'd, the worst on mee must light, when time shall be, for so i undertook before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine of right, that i may mitigate thir doom on me deriv'd, yet i shall temper so justice with mercie, as may illustrate most them fully satisfied, and thee appease. attendance none shall need, nor train, where none are to behold the judgment, but the judg'd, those two; the third best absent is condemn'd, convict by flight, and rebel to all law conviction to the serpent none belongs. thus saying, from his radiant seat he rose of high collateral glorie: him thrones and powers, princedoms, and dominations ministrant accompanied to heaven gate, from whence eden and all the coast in prospect lay. down he descended strait; the speed of gods time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing'd. now was the sun in western cadence low from noon, and gentle aires due at thir hour to fan the earth now wak'd, and usher in the eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole came the mild judge and intercessor both to sentence man: the voice of god they heard now walking in the garden, by soft windes brought to thir ears, while day declin'd, they heard, and from his presence hid themselves among the thickest trees, both man and wife, till god approaching, thus to adam call'd aloud. where art thou adam, wont with joy to meet my coming seen far off? i miss thee here, not pleas'd, thus entertaind with solitude, where obvious dutie erewhile appear'd unsaught: or come i less conspicuous, or what change absents thee, or what chance detains? come forth. he came, and with him eve, more loth, though first to offend, discount'nanc't both, and discompos'd; love was not in thir looks, either to god or to each other, but apparent guilt, and shame, and perturbation, and despaire, anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile. whence adam faultring long, thus answer'd brief. i heard thee in the garden, and of thy voice affraid, being naked, hid my self. to whom the gracious judge without revile repli'd. my voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear'd, but still rejoyc't, how is it now become so dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the tree whereof i gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat? to whom thus adam sore beset repli'd. o heav'n! in evil strait this day i stand before my judge, either to undergoe my self the total crime, or to accuse my other self, the partner of my life; whose failing, while her faith to me remaines, i should conceal, and not expose to blame by my complaint; but strict necessitie subdues me, and calamitous constraint least on my head both sin and punishment, however insupportable, be all devolv'd; though should i hold my peace, yet thou wouldst easily detect what i conceale. this woman whom thou mad'st to be my help, and gav'st me as thy perfet gift, so good, so fit, so acceptable, so divine, that from her hand i could suspect no ill, and what she did, whatever in it self, her doing seem'd to justifie the deed; shee gave me of the tree, and i did eate. to whom the sovran presence thus repli'd. was shee thy god, that her thou didst obey before his voice, or was shee made thy guide, superior, or but equal, that to her thou did'st resigne thy manhood, and the place wherein god set thee above her made of thee, and for thee, whose perfection farr excell'd hers in all real dignitie: adornd shee was indeed, and lovely to attract thy love, not thy subjection, and her gifts were such as under government well seem'd, unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part and person, had'st thou known thy self aright. so having said, he thus to eve in few: say woman, what is this which thou hast done? to whom sad eve with shame nigh overwhelm'd, confessing soon, yet not before her judge bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli'd. the serpent me beguil'd and i did eate. which when the lord god heard, without delay to judgement he proceeded on th' accus'd serpent though brute, unable to transferre the guilt on him who made him instrument of mischief, and polluted from the end of his creation; justly then accurst, as vitiated in nature: more to know concern'd not man (since he no further knew) nor alter'd his offence; yet god at last to satan first in sin his doom apply'd, though in mysterious terms, judg'd as then best: and on the serpent thus his curse let fall. because thou hast done this, thou art accurst above all cattle, each beast of the field; upon thy belly groveling thou shalt goe, and dust shalt eat all the dayes of thy life. between thee and the woman i will put enmitie, and between thine and her seed; her seed shall bruse thy head, thou bruise his heel. so spake this oracle, then verifi'd when jesus son of mary second eve, saw satan fall like lightning down from heav'n, prince of the aire; then rising from his grave spoild principalities and powers, triumpht in open shew, and with ascention bright captivity led captive through the aire, the realm it self of satan long usurpt, whom he shall tread at last under our feet; eeven hee who now foretold his fatal bruise, and to the woman thus his sentence turn'd. thy sorrow i will greatly multiplie by thy conception; children thou shalt bring in sorrow forth, and to thy husbands will thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule. on adam last thus judgement he pronounc'd. because thou hast heark'nd to the voice of thy wife, and eaten of the tree concerning which i charg'd thee, saying: thou shalt not eate thereof, curs'd is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow shalt eate thereof all the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth unbid, and thou shalt eate th' herb of th' field, in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground, for thou out of the ground wast taken, know thy birth, for dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne. so judg'd he man, both judge and saviour sent, and th' instant stroke of death denounc't that day remov'd farr off; then pittying how they stood before him naked to the aire, that now must suffer change, disdain'd not to begin thenceforth the form of servant to assume, as when he wash'd his servants feet so now as father of his familie he clad thir nakedness with skins of beasts, or slain, or as the snake with youthful coate repaid; and thought not much to cloath his enemies: nor hee thir outward onely with the skins of beasts, but inward nakedness, much more opprobrious, with his robe of righteousness, araying cover'd from his fathers sight. to him with swift ascent he up returnd, into his blissful bosom reassum'd in glory as of old, to him appeas'd all, though all-knowing, what had past with man recounted, mixing intercession sweet. meanwhile ere thus was sin'd and judg'd on earth, within the gates of hell sate sin and death, in counterview within the gates, that now stood open wide, belching outrageous flame farr into chaos, since the fiend pass'd through, sin opening, who thus now to death began. o son, why sit we here each other viewing idlely, while satan our great author thrives in other worlds, and happier seat provides for us his ofspring deare; it cannot be but that success attends him; if mishap, ere this he had return'd, with fury driv'n by his avenger, since no place like this can fit his punishment, or their revenge. methinks i feel new strength within me rise, wings growing, and dominion giv'n me large beyond this deep; whatever drawes me on, or sympathie, or som connatural force powerful at greatest distance to unite with secret amity things of like kinde by secretest conveyance. thou my shade inseparable must with mee along: for death from sin no power can separate. but least the difficultie of passing back stay his return perhaps over this gulfe impassable, impervious, let us try adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine not unagreeable, to found a path over this maine from hell to that new world where satan now prevailes, a monument of merit high to all th' infernal host, easing thir passage hence, for intercourse, or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead. nor can i miss the way, so strongly drawn by this new felt attraction and instinct. whom thus the meager shadow answerd soon. goe whither fate and inclination strong leads thee, i shall not lag behinde, nor erre the way, thou leading, such a sent i draw of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste the savour of death from all things there that live: nor shall i to the work thou enterprisest be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. so saying, with delight he snuff'd the smell of mortal change on earth. as when a flock of ravenous fowl, though many a league remote, against the day of battel, to a field, where armies lie encampt, come flying, lur'd with sent of living carcasses design'd for death, the following day, in bloodie fight. so sented the grim feature, and upturn'd his nostril wide into the murkie air, sagacious of his quarry from so farr. then both from out hell gates into the waste wide anarchie of chaos damp and dark flew divers, and with power (thir power was great) hovering upon the waters; what they met solid or slimie, as in raging sea tost up and down, together crowded drove from each side shoaling towards the mouth of hell. as when two polar winds blowing adverse upon the cronian sea, together drive mountains of ice, that stop th' imagin'd way beyond petsora eastward, to the rich cathaian coast. the aggregated soyle death with his mace petrific, cold and dry, as with a trident smote, and fix't as firm as delos floating once; the rest his look bound with gorgonian rigor not to move, and with asphaltic slime; broad as the gate, deep to the roots of hell the gather'd beach they fasten'd, and the mole immense wraught on over the foaming deep high archt, a bridge of length prodigious joyning to the wall immovable of this now fenceless world forfeit to death; from hence a passage broad, smooth, easie, inoffensive down to hell. so, if great things to small may be compar'd, xerxes, the libertie of greece to yoke, from susa his memnonian palace high came to the sea, and over hellespont bridging his way, europe with asia joyn'd, and scourg'd with many a stroak th' indignant waves. now had they brought the work by wondrous art pontifical, a ridge of pendent rock over the vext abyss, following the track of satan, to the self same place where hee first lighted from his wing, and landed safe from out of chaos to the out side bare of this round world: with pinns of adamant and chains they made all fast, too fast they made and durable; and now in little space the confines met of empyrean heav'n and of this world, and on the left hand hell with long reach interpos'd; three sev'ral wayes in sight, to each of these three places led. and now thir way to earth they had descri'd, to paradise first tending, when behold satan in likeness of an angel bright betwixt the centaure and the scorpion stearing his zenith, while the sun in aries rose: disguis'd he came, but those his children dear thir parent soon discern'd, though in disguise. hee after eve seduc't, unminded slunk into the wood fast by, and changing shape to observe the sequel, saw his guileful act by eve, though all unweeting, seconded upon her husband, saw thir shame that sought vain covertures; but when he saw descend the son of god to judge them terrifi'd hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun the present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth might suddenly inflict; that past, return'd by night, and listening where the hapless paire sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint, thence gatherd his own doom, which understood not instant, but of future time. with joy and tidings fraught, to hell he now return'd, and at the brink of chaos, neer the foot of this new wondrous pontifice, unhop't met who to meet him came, his ofspring dear. great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight of that stupendious bridge his joy encreas'd. long hee admiring stood, till sin, his faire inchanting daughter, thus the silence broke. o parent, these are thy magnific deeds, thy trophies, which thou view'st as not thine own, thou art thir author and prime architect: for i no sooner in my heart divin'd, my heart, which by a secret harmonie still moves with thine, join'd in connexion sweet, that thou on earth hadst prosper'd, which thy looks now also evidence, but straight i felt though distant from thee worlds between, yet felt that i must after thee with this thy son; such fatal consequence unites us three: hell could no longer hold us in her bounds, nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure detain from following thy illustrious track. thou hast atchiev'd our libertie, confin'd within hell gates till, now, thou us impow'rd to fortifie thus farr, and overlay with this portentous bridge the dark abyss. thine now is all this world, thy vertue hath won what thy hands builded not, thy wisdom gain'd with odds what warr hath lost, and fully aveng'd our foile in heav'n; here thou shalt monarch reign, there didst not; there let him still victor sway, as battel hath adjudg'd, from this new world retiring, by his own doom alienated, and henceforth monarchie with thee divide of all things parted by th' empyreal bounds, his quadrature, from thy orbicular world, or trie thee now more dang'rous to his throne. whom thus the prince of darkness answerd glad. fair daughter, and thou son and grandchild both, high proof ye now have giv'n to be the race of satan (for i glorie in the name, antagonist of heav'ns almightie king) amply have merited of me, of all th' infernal empire, that so neer heav'ns dore triumphal with triumphal act have met, mine with this glorious work, and made one realm hell and this world, one realm, one continent of easie thorough-fare. therefore while i descend through darkness, on your rode with ease to my associate powers, them to acquaint with these successes, and with them rejoyce, you two this way, among these numerous orbs all yours, right down to paradise descend; there dwell and reign in bliss, thence on the earth dominion exercise and in the aire, chiefly on man, sole lord of all declar'd, him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. my substitutes i send ye, and create plenipotent on earth, of matchless might issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now my hold of this new kingdom all depends, through sin to death expos'd by my exploit. if your joynt power prevailes, th' affaires of hell no detriment need feare, goe and be strong. so saying he dismiss'd them, they with speed thir course through thickest constellations held spreading thir bane; the blasted starrs lookt wan, and planets, planet-strook, real eclips then sufferd. th' other way satan went down the causey to hell gate; on either side disparted chaos over built exclaimd, and with rebounding surge the barrs assaild, that scorn'd his indignation: through the gate, wide open and unguarded, satan pass'd, and all about found desolate; for those appointed to sit there, had left thir charge, flown to the upper world; the rest were all farr to the inland retir'd, about the walls of pandaemonium, citie and proud seate of lucifer, so by allusion calld, of that bright starr to satan paragond. there kept thir watch the legions, while the grand in council sate, sollicitous what chance might intercept thir emperour sent, so hee departing gave command, and they observ'd. as when the tartar from his russian foe by astracan over the snowie plaines retires, or bactrian sophi from the hornes of turkish crescent, leaves all waste beyond the realm of aladule, in his retreate to tauris or casbeen. so these the late heav'n-banisht host, left desert utmost hell many a dark league, reduc't in careful watch round thir metropolis, and now expecting each hour their great adventurer from the search of forrein worlds: he through the midst unmarkt, in shew plebeian angel militant of lowest order, past; and from the dore of that plutonian hall, invisible ascended his high throne, which under state of richest texture spred, at th' upper end was plac't in regal lustre. down a while he sate, and round about him saw unseen: at last as from a cloud his fulgent head and shape starr bright appeer'd, or brighter, clad with what permissive glory since his fall was left him, or false glitter: all amaz'd at that so sudden blaze the stygian throng bent thir aspect, and whom they wish'd beheld, thir mighty chief returnd: loud was th' acclaime: forth rush'd in haste the great consulting peers, rais'd from thir dark divan, and with like joy congratulant approach'd him, who with hand silence, and with these words attention won. thrones, dominations, princedoms, vertues, powers, for in possession such, not onely of right, i call ye and declare ye now, returnd successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth triumphant out of this infernal pit abominable, accurst, the house of woe, and dungeon of our tyrant: now possess, as lords, a spacious world, to our native heaven little inferiour, by my adventure hard with peril great atchiev'd. long were to tell what i have don, what sufferd, with what paine voyag'd th' unreal, vast, unbounded deep of horrible confusion, over which by sin and death a broad way now is pav'd to expedite your glorious march; but i toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride th' untractable abysse, plung'd in the womb of unoriginal night and chaos wilde, that jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd my journey strange, with clamorous uproare protesting fate supreame; thence how i found the new created world, which fame in heav'n long had foretold, a fabrick wonderful of absolute perfection, therein man plac't in a paradise, by our exile made happie; him by fraud i have seduc'd from his creator, and the more to increase your wonder, with an apple; he thereat offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up both his beloved man and all his world, to sin and death a prey, and so to us, without our hazard, labour, or allarme, to range in, and to dwell, and over man to rule, as over all he should have rul'd. true is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather mee not, but the brute serpent in whose shape man i deceav'd: that which to mee belongs, is enmity, which he will put between mee and mankinde; i am to bruise his heel; his seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: a world who would not purchase with a bruise, or much more grievous pain? ye have th' account of my performance: what remains, ye gods, but up and enter now into full bliss. so having said, a while he stood, expecting thir universal shout and high applause to fill his eare, when contrary he hears on all sides, from innumerable tongues a dismal universal hiss, the sound of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long had leasure, wondring at himself now more; his visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare, his armes clung to his ribs, his leggs entwining each other, till supplanted down he fell a monstrous serpent on his belly prone, reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd, according to his doom: he would have spoke, but hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue to forked tongue, for now were all transform'd alike, to serpents all as accessories to his bold riot: dreadful was the din of hissing through the hall, thick swarming now with complicated monsters head and taile, scorpion and asp, and amphisbaena dire, cerastes hornd, hydrus, and ellops drear, and dipsas (not so thick swarm'd once the soil bedropt with blood of gorgon, or the isle ophiusa) but still greatest hee the midst, now dragon grown, larger then whom the sun ingenderd in the pythian vale on slime, huge python, and his power no less he seem'd above the rest still to retain; they all him follow'd issuing forth to th' open field, where all yet left of that revolted rout heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array, sublime with expectation when to see ln triumph issuing forth thir glorious chief; they saw, but other sight instead, a crowd of ugly serpents; horror on them fell, and horrid sympathie; for what they saw, they felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms, down fell both spear and shield, down they as fast, and the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form catcht by contagion, like in punishment, as in thir crime. thus was th' applause they meant, turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame cast on themselves from thir own mouths. there stood a grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change, his will who reigns above, to aggravate thir penance, laden with fruit like that which grew in paradise, the bait of eve us'd by the tempter: on that prospect strange thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining for one forbidden tree a multitude now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame; yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce, though to delude them sent, could not abstain, but on they rould in heaps, and up the trees climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks that curld megaera: greedily they pluck'd the frutage fair to sight, like that which grew neer that bituminous lake where sodom flam'd; this more delusive, not the touch, but taste deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay thir appetite with gust, instead of fruit chewd bitter ashes, which th' offended taste with spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd, hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft, with hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws with soot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell into the same illusion, not as man whom they triumph'd once lapst. thus were they plagu'd and worn with famin, long and ceasless hiss, till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd, yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo this annual humbling certain number'd days, to dash thir pride, and joy for man seduc't. however some tradition they dispers'd among the heathen of thir purchase got, and fabl'd how the serpent, whom they calld ophion with eurynome, the wide- encroaching eve perhaps, had first the rule of high olympus, thence by saturn driv'n and ops, ere yet dictaean jove was born. mean while in paradise the hellish pair too soon arriv'd, sin there in power before, once actual, now in body, and to dwell habitual habitant; behind her death close following pace for pace, not mounted yet on his pale horse: to whom sin thus began. second of satan sprung, all conquering death, what thinkst thou of our empire now, though earnd with travail difficult, not better farr then stil at hels dark threshold to have sate watch, unnam'd, undreaded, and thy self half starv'd? whom thus the sin-born monster answerd soon. to mee, who with eternal famin pine, alike is hell, or paradise, or heaven, there best, where most with ravin i may meet; which here, though plenteous, all too little seems to stuff this maw, this vast unhide-bound corps. to whom th' incestuous mother thus repli'd. thou therefore on these herbs, and fruits, and flours feed first, on each beast next, and fish, and fowle, no homely morsels, and whatever thing the sithe of time mowes down, devour unspar'd, till i in man residing through the race, his thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect, and season him thy last and sweetest prey. this said, they both betook them several wayes, both to destroy, or unimmortal make all kinds, and for destruction to mature sooner or later; which th' almightie seeing, from his transcendent seat the saints among, to those bright orders utterd thus his voice. see with what heat these dogs of hell advance to waste and havoc yonder world, which i so fair and good created, and had still kept in that state, had not the folly of man let in these wastful furies, who impute folly to mee, so doth the prince of hell and his adherents, that with so much ease i suffer them to enter and possess a place so heav'nly, and conniving-seem to gratifie my scornful enemies, that laugh, as if transported with some fit of passion, i to them had quitted all, at random yielded up to their misrule; and know not that i call'd and drew them thither my hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth which mans polluting sin with taint hath shed on what was pure, till cramm'd and gorg'd, nigh burst with suckt and glutted offal, at one sling of thy victorious arm, well-pleasing son, both sin, and death, and yawning grave at last through chaos hurld, obstruct the mouth of hell for ever, and seal up his ravenous jawes. then heav'n and earth renewd shall be made pure to sanctitie that shall receive no staine: till then the curse pronounc't on both precedes. he ended, and the heav'nly audience loud sung halleluia, as the sound of seas, through multitude that sung: just are thy ways, righteous are thy decrees on all thy works; who can extenuate thee? next, to the son, destin'd restorer of mankind, by whom new heav'n and earth shall to the ages rise, or down from heav'n descend. such was thir song, while the creator calling forth by name his mightie angels gave them several charge, as sorted best with present things. the sun had first his precept so to move, so shine, as might affect the earth with cold and heat scarce tollerable, and from the north to call decrepit winter, from the south to bring solstitial summers heat. to the blanc moone her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five thir planetarie motions and aspects in sextile, square, and trine, and opposite, of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne in synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt thir influence malignant when to showre, which of them rising with the sun, or falling, should prove tempestuous: to the winds they set thir corners, when with bluster to confound sea, aire, and shoar, the thunder when to rowle with terror through the dark aereal hall. some say he bid his angels turne ascanse the poles of earth twice ten degrees and more from the suns axle; they with labour push'd oblique the centric globe: som say the sun was bid turn reines from th' equinoctial rode like distant breadth to taurus with the seav'n atlantick sisters, and the spartan twins up to the tropic crab; thence down amaine by leo and the virgin and the scales, as deep as capricorne, to bring in change of seasons to each clime; else had the spring perpetual smil'd on earth with vernant flours, equal in days and nights, except to those beyond the polar circles; to them day had unbenighted shon, while the low sun to recompence his distance, in thir sight had rounded still th' horizon, and not known or east or west, which had forbid the snow from cold estotiland, and south as farr beneath magellan. at that tasted fruit the sun, as from thyestean banquet, turn'd his course intended; else how had the world inhabited, though sinless, more then now, avoided pinching cold and scorching heate? these changes in the heav'ns, though slow, produc'd like change on sea and land, sideral blast, vapour, and mist, and exhalation hot, corrupt and pestilent: now from the north of norumbega, and the samoed shoar bursting thir brazen dungeon, armd with ice and snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw, boreas and caecias and argestes loud and thrascias rend the woods and seas upturn; with adverse blast upturns them from the south notus and afer black with thundrous clouds from serraliona; thwart of these as fierce forth rush the levant and the ponent windes eurus and zephir with thir lateral noise, sirocco, and libecchio, thus began outrage from liveless things; but discord first daughter of sin, among th' irrational, death introduc'd through fierce antipathie: beast now with beast gan war, and fowle with fowle, and fish with fish; to graze the herb all leaving, devourd each other; nor stood much in awe of man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim glar'd on him passing: these were from without the growing miseries, which adam saw alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, to sorrow abandond, but worse felt within, and in a troubl'd sea of passion tost, thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint. o miserable of happie! is this the end of this new glorious world, and mee so late the glory of that glory, who now becom accurst of blessed, hide me from the face of god, whom to behold was then my highth of happiness: yet well, if here would end the miserie, i deserv'd it, and would beare my own deservings; but this will not serve; all that i eat or drink, or shall beget, is propagated curse. o voice once heard delightfully, encrease and multiply, now death to heare! for what can i encrease or multiplie, but curses on my head? who of all ages to succeed, but feeling the evil on him brought by me, will curse my head, ill fare our ancestor impure, for this we may thank adam; but his thanks shall be the execration; so besides mine own that bide upon me, all from mee shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound, on mee as on thir natural center light heavie, though in thir place. o fleeting joyes of paradise, deare bought with lasting woes! did i request thee, maker, from my clay to mould me man, did i sollicite thee from darkness to promote me, or here place in this delicious garden? as my will concurd not to my being, it were but right and equal to reduce me to my dust, desirous to resigne, and render back all i receav'd, unable to performe thy terms too hard, by which i was to hold the good i sought not. to the loss of that, sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added the sense of endless woes? inexplicable thy justice seems; yet to say truth, too late, i thus contest; then should have been refusd those terms whatever, when they were propos'd: thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good, then cavil the conditions? and though god made thee without thy leave, what if thy son prove disobedient, and reprov'd, retort, wherefore didst thou beget me? i sought it not: wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee that proud excuse? yet him not thy election, but natural necessity begot. god made thee of choice his own, and of his own to serve him, thy reward was of his grace, thy punishment then justly is at his will. be it so, for i submit, his doom is fair, that dust i am, and shall to dust returne: o welcom hour whenever! why delayes his hand to execute what his decree fixd on this day? why do i overlive, why am i mockt with death, and length'nd out to deathless pain? how gladly would i meet mortalitie my sentence, and be earth insensible, how glad would lay me down as in my mothers lap? there i should rest and sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more would thunder in my ears, no fear of worse to mee and to my ofspring would torment me with cruel expectation. yet one doubt pursues me still, least all i cannot die, least that pure breath of life, the spirit of man which god inspir'd, cannot together perish with this corporeal clod; then in the grave, or in some other dismal place who knows but i shall die a living death? o thought horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath of life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life and sin? the bodie properly hath neither. all of me then shall die: let this appease the doubt, since humane reach no further knows. for though the lord of all be infinite, is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so, but mortal doom'd. how can he exercise wrath without end on man whom death must end? can he make deathless death? that were to make strange contradiction, which to god himself impossible is held, as argument of weakness, not of power. will he, draw out, for angers sake, finite to infinite in punisht man, to satisfie his rigour satisfi'd never; that were to extend his sentence beyond dust and natures law, by which all causes else according still to the reception of thir matter act, not to th' extent of thir own spheare. but say that death be not one stroak, as i suppos'd, bereaving sense, but endless miserie from this day onward, which 1 feel begun both in me, and without me, and so last to perpetuitie; ay me, that fear comes thundring back with dreadful revolution on my defensless head; both death and i am found eternal, and incorporate both, nor i on my part single, in mee all posteritie stands curst: fair patrimonie that i must leave ye, sons; o were i able to waste it all my self, and leave ye none! so disinherited how would ye bless me now your curse! ah, why should all mankind for one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn'd, if guiltless? but from me what can proceed, but all corrupt, both mind and will deprav'd, not to do onely, but to will the same with me? how can they then acquitted stand in sight of god? him after all disputes forc't i absolve: all my evasions vain, and reasonings, though through mazes, lead me still but to my own conviction: first and last on mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring of all corruption, all the blame lights due; so might the wrauth. fond wish! couldst thou support that burden heavier then the earth to bear then all the world much heavier, though divided with that bad woman? thus what thou desir'st and what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope of refuge, and concludes thee miserable beyond all past example and future, to satan only like both crime and doom. o conscience, into what abyss of fears and horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which i find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd! thus adam to himself lamented loud through the still night, not now, as ere man fell, wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black air accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom, which to his evil conscience represented all things with double terror: on the ground outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft curs'd his creation, death as oft accus'd of tardie execution, since denounc't the day of his offence. why comes not death, said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke to end me? shall truth fail to keep her word, justice divine not hast'n to be just? but death comes not at call, justice divine mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries. o woods, o fountains, hillocks, dales and bowrs, with other echo late i taught your shades to answer, and resound farr other song. whom thus afflicted when sad eve bebeld, desolate where she sate, approaching nigh, soft words to his fierce passion she assay'd: but her with stern regard he thus repell'd. out of my sight, thou serpent, that name best befits thee with him leagu'd, thy self as false and hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, like his, and colour serpentine may shew thy inward fraud, to warn all creatures from thee henceforth; least that too heav'nly form, pretended to hellish falshood, snare them. but for thee i had persisted happie, had not thy pride and wandring vanitie, when lest was safe, rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd not to be trusted, longing to be seen though by the devil himself, him overweening to over-reach, but with the serpent meeting fool'd and beguil'd, by him thou, i by thee, to trust thee from my side, imagin'd wise, constant, mature, proof against all assaults, and understood not all was but a shew rather then solid vertu, all but a rib crooked by nature, bent, as now appears, more to the part sinister from me drawn, well if thrown out, as supernumerarie to my just number found. o why did god, creator wise, that peopl'd highest heav'n with spirits masculine, create at last this noveltie on earth, this fair defect of nature, and not fill the world at once with men as angels without feminine, or find some other way to generate mankind? this mischief had not then befall'n, and more that shall befall, innumerable disturbances on earth through femal snares, and straight conjunction with this sex: for either he never shall find out fit mate, but such as some misfortune brings him, or mistake, or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain through her perversness, but shall see her gaind by a farr worse, or if she love, withheld by parents, or his happiest choice too late shall meet, alreadie linkt and wedlock-bound to a fell adversarie, his hate or shame: which infinite calamitie shall cause to humane life, and houshold peace confound. he added not, and from her turn'd, but eve not so repulst, with tears that ceas'd not flowing, and tresses all disorderd, at his feet fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught his peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. forsake me not thus, adam, witness heav'n what love sincere, and reverence in my heart i beare thee, and unweeting have offended, unhappilie deceav'd; thy suppliant i beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, whereon i live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, thy counsel in this uttermost distress, my onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee, whither shall i betake me, where subsist? while yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps, between us two let there be peace, both joyning, as joyn'd in injuries, one enmitie against a foe by doom express assign'd us, that cruel serpent: on me exercise not thy hatred for this miserie befall'n, on me alreadie lost, mee then thy self more miserable; both have sin'd, but thou against god onely, i against god and thee, and to the place of judgment will return, there with my cries importune heaven, that all the sentence from thy head remov'd may light on me, sole cause to thee of all this woe, mee mee onely just object of his ire. she ended weeping, and her lowlie plight, immoveable till peace obtain'd from fault acknowledg'd and deplor'd, in adam wraught commiseration; soon his heart relented towards her, his life so late and sole delight, now at his feet submissive in distress, creature so faire his reconcilement seeking, his counsel whom she had displeas'd, his aide; as one disarm'd, his anger all he lost, and thus with peaceful words uprais'd her soon. unwarie, and too desirous, as before, so now of what thou knowst not, who desir'st the punishment all on thy self; alas, beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine his full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part, and my displeasure bearst so ill. if prayers could alter high decrees, i to that place would speed before thee, and be louder heard, that on my head all might be visited, thy frailtie and infirmer sex forgiv'n, to me committed and by me expos'd. but rise, let us no more contend, nor blame each other, blam'd enough elsewhere, but strive in offices of love, how we may light'n each others burden in our share of woe; since this days death denounc't, if ought i see, will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac't evill, a long days dying to augment our paine, and to our seed (o hapless seed!) deriv'd. to whom thus eve, recovering heart, repli'd. adam, by sad experiment i know how little weight my words with thee can finde, found so erroneous, thence by just event found so unfortunate; nevertheless, restor'd by thee, vile as i am, to place of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine thy love, the sole contentment of my heart living or dying, from thee i will not hide what thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n, tending to some relief of our extremes, or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, as in our evils, and of easier choice. if care of our descent perplex us most, which must be born to certain woe, devourd by death at last, and miserable it is to be to others cause of misery, our own begotten, and of our loines to bring into this cursed world a woful race, that after wretched life must be at last food for so foule a monster, in thy power it lies, yet ere conception to prevent the race unblest, to being yet unbegot. childless thou art, childless remaine: so death shall be deceav'd his glut, and with us two be forc'd to satisfie his rav'nous maw. but if thou judge it hard and difficult, conversing, looking, loving, to abstain from loves due rites, nuptial imbraces sweet, and with desire to languish without hope, before the present object languishing with like desire, which would be meserie and torment less then none of what we dread, then both our selves and seed at once to free from what we fear for both, let us make short, let us seek death, or he not found, supply with our own hands his office on our selves; why stand we longer shivering under feares, that shew no end but death, and have the power, of many ways to die the shortest choosing, destruction with destruction to destroy. she ended heer, or vehement despaire broke off the rest; so much of death her thoughts had entertaind, as di'd her cheeks with pale. but adam with such counsel nothing sway'd, to better hopes his more attentive minde labouring had rais'd, and thus to eve repli'd. eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems to argue in thee somthing more sublime and excellent then what thy minde contemnes; but self-destruction therefore saught, refutes that excellence thought in thee, and implies, not thy contempt, but anguish and regret for loss of life and pleasure overlov'd. or if thou covet death, as utmost end of miserie, so thinking to evade the penaltie pronounc't, doubt not but god hath wiselier arm'd his vengeful ire then so to be forestall'd; much more i fear least death so snatcht will not exempt us from the paine we are by doom to pay; rather such acts of contumacie will provoke the highest to make death in us live: then let us seek some safer resolution, which methinks i have in view, calling to minde with heed part of our sentence, that thy seed shall bruise the serpents head; piteous amends, unless be meant, whom i conjecture, our grand foe satan, who in the serpent hath contriv'd against us this deceit: to crush his head would be revenge indeed; which will be lost by death brought on our selves, or childless days resolv'd, as thou proposest; so our foe shall scape his punishment ordain'd, and wee instead shall double ours upon our heads. no more be mention'd then of violence against our selves, and wilful barrenness, that cuts us off from hope, and savours onely rancor and pride, impatience and despite, reluctance against god and his just yoke laid on our necks. remember with what mild and gracious temper he both heard and judg'd without wrauth or reviling; wee expected immediate dissolution, which we thought was meant by death that day, when lo, to thee pains onely in child-bearing were foretold, and bringing forth, soon recompenc't with joy, fruit of thy womb: on mee the curse aslope glanc'd on the ground, with labour i must earne my bread; what harm? idleness had bin worse; my labour will sustain me; and least cold or heat should injure us, his timely care hath unbesaught provided, and his hands cloath'd us unworthie, pitying while he judg'd; how much more, if we pray him, will his ear be open, and his heart to pitie incline, and teach us further by what means to shun th' inclement seasons, rain, ice, hail and snow, which now the skie with various face begins to shew us in this mountain, while the winds blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks of these fair spreading trees; which bids us seek som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish our limbs benumm'd, ere this diurnal starr leave cold the night, how we his gather'd beams reflected, may with matter sere foment, or by collision of two bodies grinde the air attrite to fire, as late the clouds justling or pusht with winds rude in thir shock tine the slant lightning, whose thwart flame driv'n down kindles the gummie bark of firr or pine, and sends a comfortable heat from farr, which might supplie the sun: such fire to use, and what may else be remedie or cure to evils which our own misdeeds have wrought, hee will instruct us praying, and of grace beseeching him, so as we need not fear to pass commodiously this life, sustain'd by him with many comforts, till we end in dust, our final rest and native home. what better can we do, then to the place repairing where he judg'd us, prostrate fall before him reverent, and there confess humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears watering the ground, and with our sighs the air frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek. undoubtedly he will relent and turn from his displeasure;

'tis of the rushing of an host in rout, with groans, of trampled men, with smarting wounds— at once they groan with pain, and shudder with the cold! but hush! there is a pause of deepest silence! and all that noise, as of a rushing crowd, with groans, and tremulous shudderings—all is over— it tells another tale, with sounds less deep and loud! a tale of less affright, and tempered with delight, as otway's self had framed the tender lay,— 'tis of a little child upon a lonesome wild, nor far from home, but she hath lost her way: and now moans low in bitter grief and fear, and now screams loud, and hopes to make her mother hear. viii 'tis midnight, but small thoughts have i of sleep: full seldom may my friend such vigils keep! visit her, gentle sleep! with wings of healing, and may this storm be but a mountain-birth, may all the stars hang bright above her dwelling, silent as though they watched the sleeping earth! with light heart may she rise, gay fancy, cheerful eyes, joy lift her spirit, joy attune her voice; to her may all things live, from pole to pole, their life the eddying of her living soul! o simple spirit, guided from above, dear lady! friend devoutest of my choice, thus mayest thou ever, evermore rejoice. <line>","living,disappointment & failure,sorrow & grieving,the mind,nature,landscapes & pastorals,stars, planets, heavens,weather,winter,religion"

and sure too, if some man <line> <line>comes to take your inheritance, even if he’s your best friend, <line> <line>even if he takes good care of your mother, you’d be a fool <line> <line>not to sue him to the council, even if you’d have to accuse him <line> <line>falsely of black magic. that’s the beauty of it, or rather, <line> <line>whoever is going to win will have to make us trust beauty, <line> <line>that things being already right, can be more right, which <line> <line>is what “beautiful” really means. and what better way, <line> <line>to take in all this refinement than hearing it in a latrine <line> <line>where only beauty shields you from the awful stuff of life. <line> <line>8. <line> <line>marcus aurelius, the men at the shore follow your path <line> <line>into eternity, though they already see their journey <line> <line>as a quarrel with circumstance, their lives abscesses feeding <line> <line>on the universe’s hide, tumors in detention camps, <line> <line>in basement kitchens. their pockets filled with drachmas, <line> <line>they’ll lift diffident heads and drag feet lead-heavy with shame. <line> <line>one of them is now driving a taxi in thessaloniki or perugia. <line> <line>with enough of the language to understand direction, he engages <line> <line>his late night passengers. in the light of the dashboard <line> <line>they’ll entrust him with their secrets. with time, he’ll become <line> <line>a light unto himself, his car a winged chariot of human folly, <line> <line>and his responses to them saplings nourished in the dark <line> <line>soil of philosophy. it’s the gift of seasons that stray <line> <line>from the earth, when soul reigns incidental to flesh, <line> <line>forgiving to no end, a light that has long surpassed itself. <line> <line>9. <line> <line>the birds that drew the line to the first distance <line> <line>remain nameless to me— <line> <line>creamy white breasts, gold dust around their eyes, <line> <line>black/brown (dark roast) wings. <line> <line>the deserts they crossed, the plains east <line> <line>or north of here fall like sand from my hands.um bsisi, i want to call them, citizens of a protracted destiny, <line> <line>native and stranger, prodigal and peasant— <line> <line>admit now, they you’re none of these, <line> <line>that you’re not any, <line> <line> or even all of them combined. <line> <line>10. <line> <line>southwest of here is apuleius’s hometown, his inescapable <line> <line>destination having spent his inheritance on travel and studies. <line> <line>“lacking the poverty of the rich,” he’s splurged, <line> <line>a month-long trip to the olympic games; and openhanded, <line> <line>he gifted his mentors their daughters’ doweries. <line> <line>few return to madaura once gone, and when heading back <line> <line>shamefaced like him, they’d do as he did, taking <line> <line>the longest route hoping the journey would never end. here <line> <line>in sabratha, the widow hooked him, or he let her reel him, <line> <line>and that’s how that sordid business happily ended as it began. <line> <line>i look out toward madaura, my back to the theater <line> <line>and the latrines, madaura birthplace of augustine, site of <line> <line>his first schooling—little augustine holding a satchel of scrolls <line> <line>and a loaf of bread for the teacher, awakened by his mother, <line> <line>his tiny feet cold in tiny sandals, his stomach warm <line> <line>with a barley porridge my grandmother used to make, forced <line> <line>to slurp it, sweetened with honey from the atlas, a sprinkling <line> <line>of cinnamon and crushed almonds from the family farm. <line> <line>if the world is that sweet and warm, if it is that mothering, <line> <line>why then this perpetual scene of separation, this turning <line> <line>out into the cold toward something he knew he’d love? <line> <line>he lets go of the neighbors’ boy’s hand warming his own. <line> <line>he refuses the warm porridge forever, renounces <line> <line>his mother’s embrace. it only lasted a month, <line> <line>this partial answer, because even then everyone knew <line> <line>that the sweet fruit they grew housed the bitterest seeds, <line> <line>that piety is its own reward while belief only darkens <line> <line>and deepens like the sea before them, a place <line> <line>meant for those seeking life other than on this dry earth. <line> <line>that’s why prophets were welcomed here, calmly, <line> <line>because god was like rain and they like the saplings <line> <line>which know only the first verse to the sky’s rainless hymn. <line> <line>and that’s why africa’s tallest minaret looms unfinished, <line> <line>visible from the next town over, and for fifty leagues from the sea if <line> <line>it were turned into a lighthouse for the ships that no longer come. <line> <line>the merchant who’d built it, money made from smuggling <line> <line>subsidized goods to carthage and used renaults from rotterdam, <line> <line>ran out of money, could not afford the mosque that was to stand <line> <line>next to it, leaving its gray concrete bleaching in the sun. <line> <line>there’s enough history here to enable anyone to finish the thought. <line> <line>it’s useless then to track the fate of these travelers, <line> <line>some, without life jackets, had never learned how to swim. <line> <line>why not let them live in text as they do in life?—they’ve lived <line> <line>without words for so long—why not release them <line> <line>from the pen’s anchor and let them drift to their completion?

9308,13038,"<line> <line>so all day long the noise of battle roll'd among the mountains by the winter sea; until king arthur's table, man by man, had fallen in lyonnesse about their lord, king arthur: then, because his wound was deep, the bold sir bedivere uplifted him, sir bedivere, the last of all his knights, and bore him to a chapel nigh the field, a broken chancel with a broken cross, that stood on a dark strait of barren land. on one side lay the ocean, and on one lay a great water, and the moon was full. then spake king arthur to sir bedivere: ""the sequel of to-day unsolders all the goodliest fellowship of famous knights whereof this world holds record. such a sleep they sleep—the men i loved. i think that we shall never more, at any future time, delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds, walking about the gardens and the halls of camelot, as in the days that were. i perish by this people which i made,— tho' merlin sware that i should come again to rule once more—but let what will be, be, i am so deeply smitten thro' the helm that without help i cannot last till morn. thou therefore take my brand excalibur, which was my pride: for thou rememberest how in those old days, one summer noon, an arm rose up from out the bosom of the lake, clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, holding the sword—and how i row'd across and took it, and have worn it, like a king: and, wheresoever i am sung or told in aftertime, this also shall be known: but now delay not: take excalibur, and fling him far into the middle mere: watch what thou seëst, and lightly bring me word."" to him replied the bold sir bedivere: ""it is not meet, sir king, to leave thee thus, aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm. a little thing may harm a wounded man. yet i thy hest will all perform at full, watch what i see, and lightly bring thee word."" so saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept and in the moon athwart the place of tombs, where lay the mighty bones of ancient men, old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. he, stepping down by zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock, came on the shining levels of the lake. there drew he forth the brand excalibur, and o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon, brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth and sparkled keen with frost against the hilt: for all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks, myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth work of subtlest jewellery. he gazed so long that both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood, this way and that dividing the swift mind, in act to throw: but at the last it seem'd better to leave excalibur conceal'd there in the many-knotted water-flags, that whistled stiff and dry about the marge. so strode he back slow to the wounded king. then spake king arthur to sir bedivere: ""hast thou perform'd my mission which i gave? what is it thou hast seen, or what hast heard?"" and answer made the bold sir bedivere: ""i heard the ripple washing in the reeds, and the wild water lapping on the crag."" to whom replied king arthur, faint and pale: ""thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name, not rendering true answer, as beseem'd thy fealty, nor like a noble knight: for surer sign had follow'd, either hand, or voice, or else a motion of the mere. this is a shameful thing for men to lie. yet now, i charge thee, quickly go again as thou art lief and dear, and do the thing i bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word."" then went sir bedivere the second time across the ridge, and paced beside the mere, counting the dewy pebbles, fixed in thought; but when he saw the wonder of the hilt, how curiously and strangely chased, he smote his palms together, and he cried aloud, ""and if indeed i cast the brand away, surely a precious thing, one worthy note, should thus be lost forever from the earth, which might have pleased the eyes of many men. what good should follow this, if this were done? what harm, undone? deep harm to disobey, seeing obedience is the bond of rule. were it well to obey then, if a king demand an act unprofitable, against himself? the king is sick, and knows not what he does. what record, or what relic of my lord should be to aftertime, but empty breath and rumours of a doubt? but were this kept, stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings, some one might show it at a joust of arms, saying, 'king arthur's sword, excalibur, wrought by the lonely maiden of the lake; nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps upon the hidden bases of the hills.' so might some old man speak in the aftertime to all the people, winning reverence. but now much honour and much fame were lost."" so spake he, clouded with his own conceit, and hid excalibur the second time, and so strode back slow to the wounded king. then spoke king arthur, breathing heavily: ""what is it thou hast seen, or what hast heard?"" and answer made the bold sir bedivere: ""i heard the water lapping on the crag, and the long ripple washing in the reeds."" to whom replied king arthur, much in wrath: ""ah, miserable and unkind, untrue, unknightly, traitor-hearted! woe is me! authority forgets a dying king, laid widow'd of the power in his eye that bow'd the will. i see thee what thou art, for thou, the latest-left of all my knights, in whom should meet the offices of all, thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt; either from lust of gold, or like a girl valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes. yet, for a man may fail in duty twice, and the third time may prosper, get thee hence: but, if thou spare to fling excalibur, i will arise and slay thee with my hands."" then quickly rose sir bedivere, and ran, and, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged among the bulrush-beds, and clutch'd the sword, and strongly wheel'd and threw it. the great brand made lightnings in the splendour of the moon, and flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch, shot like a streamer of the northern morn, seen where the moving isles of winter shock by night, with noises of the northern sea. so flash'd and fell the brand excalibur: but ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, and caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him three times, and drew him under in the mere. and lightly went the other to the king. then spoke king arthur, drawing thicker breath: ""now see i by thine eyes that this is done. speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?"" and answer made the bold sir bedivere: ""sir king, i closed mine eyelids, lest the gems should blind my purpose, for i never saw, nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till i die, not tho' i live three lives of mortal men, so great a miracle as yonder hilt. then with both hands i flung him, wheeling him; but when i look'd again, behold an arm, clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, that caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him three times, and drew him under in the mere."" and answer made king arthur, breathing hard: ""my end draws nigh; 't is time that i were gone. make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight, and bear me to the margin; yet i fear my wound hath taken cold, and i shall die."" so saying, from the pavement he half rose, slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm, and looking wistfully with wide blue eyes as in a picture. him sir bedivere remorsefully regarded thro' his tears, and would have spoken, but he found not words, then took with care, and kneeling on one knee, o'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands, and rising bore him thro' the place of tombs. but, as he walk'd, king arthur panted hard, like one that feels a nightmare on his bed when all the house is mute. so sigh'd the king muttering and murmuring at his ear, ""quick, quick! i fear it is too late, and i shall die."" but the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge, clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk'd larger than human on the frozen hills. he heard the deep behind him, and a cry before. his own thought drove him like a goad. dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves and barren chasms, and all to left and right the bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based his feet on juts of slippery crag that rang sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels— and on a sudden, lo! the level lake, and the long glories of the winter moon. then saw they how there hove a dusky barge dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern, beneath them; and descending they were ware that all the decks were dense with stately forms black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream—by these three queens with crowns of gold—and from them rose a cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars, and, as it were one voice, an agony of lamentation, like a wind, that shrills all night in a waste land, where no one comes, or hath come, since the making of the world. then murmur'd arthur, ""place me in the barge,"" and to the barge they came. there those three queens put forth their hands, and took the king, and wept. but she that rose the tallest of them all and fairest, laid his head upon her lap, and loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his hands, and call'd him by his name, complaining loud and dropping bitter tears against his brow striped with dark blood: for all his face was white and colourless, and like the wither'd moon smote by the fresh beam of the springing east; and all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops of onset; and the light and lustrous curls— that made his forehead like a rising sun high from the daïs-throne—were parch'd with dust; or, clotted into points and hanging loose, mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips. so like a shatter'd column lay the king; not like that arthur who, with lance in rest, from spur to plume a star of tournament, shot thro' the lists at camelot, and charged before the eyes of ladies and of kings. then loudly cried the bold sir bedivere: ""ah! my lord arthur, whither shall i go? where shall i hide my forehead and my eyes? for now i see the true old times are dead, when every morning brought a noble chance, and every chance brought out a noble knight. such times have been not since the light that led the holy elders with the gift of myrrh. but now the whole round table is dissolved which was an image of the mighty world; and i, the last, go forth companionless, and the days darken round me, and the years, among new men, strange faces, other minds."" and slowly answer'd arthur from the barge: ""the old order changeth, yielding place to new, and god fulfils himself in many ways, lest one good custom should corrupt the world. comfort thyself: what comfort is in me? i have lived my life, and that which i have done may he within himself make pure! but thou, if thou shouldst never see my face again, pray for my soul. more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of. wherefore, let thy voice rise like a fountain for me night and day. for what are men better than sheep or goats that nourish a blind life within the brain, if, knowing god, they lift not hands of prayer both for themselves and those who call them friend? for so the whole round earth is every way bound by gold chains about the feet of god. but now farewell. i am going a long way with these thou seëst—if indeed i go— (for all my mind is clouded with a doubt) to the island-valley of avilion; where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow, nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard-lawns and bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea, where i will heal me of my grievous wound."" so said he, and the barge with oar and sail moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan that, fluting a wild carol ere her death, ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood with swarthy webs. long stood sir bedivere revolving many memories, till the hull look'd one black dot against the verge of dawn, and on the mere the wailing died away. <line>","living,death,sorrow & grieving,mythology & folklore,fairy-tales & legends"

therefore she weaveth steadily, therefore no other care hath she, the lady of shalott. she lives with little joy or fear. over the water, running near, the sheepbell tinkles in her ear. before her hangs a mirror clear, reflecting tower'd camelot. and as the mazy web she whirls, she sees the surly village churls, and the red cloaks of market girls pass onward from shalott. sometimes a troop of damsels glad, an abbot on an ambling pad, sometimes a curly shepherd lad, or long-hair'd page in crimson clad, goes by to tower'd camelot: and sometimes thro' the mirror blue the knights come riding two and two: she hath no loyal knight and true, the lady of shalott. but in her web she still delights to weave the mirror's magic sights, for often thro' the silent nights a funeral, with plumes and lights and music, came from camelot: or when the moon was overhead came two young lovers lately wed; 'i am half sick of shadows,' said the lady of shalott. part iii a bow-shot from her bower-eaves, he rode between the barley-sheaves, the sun came dazzling thro' the leaves, and flam'd upon the brazen greaves of bold sir lancelot. a red-cross knight for ever kneel'd to a lady in his shield, that sparkled on the yellow field, beside remote shalott. the gemmy bridle glitter'd free, like to some branch of stars we see hung in the golden galaxy. the bridle bells rang merrily as he rode down from camelot: and from his blazon'd baldric slung a mighty silver bugle hung, and as he rode his armour rung, beside remote shalott. all in the blue unclouded weather thick-jewell'd shone the saddle-leather, the helmet and the helmet-feather burn'd like one burning flame together, as he rode down from camelot. as often thro' the purple night, below the starry clusters bright, some bearded meteor, trailing light, moves over green shalott. his broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd; on burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode; from underneath his helmet flow'd his coal-black curls as on he rode, as he rode down from camelot. from the bank and from the river he flash'd into the crystal mirror, 'tirra lirra, tirra lirra:' sang sir lancelot. she left the web, she left the loom she made three paces thro' the room she saw the water-flower bloom, she saw the helmet and the plume, she look'd down to camelot. out flew the web and floated wide; the mirror crack'd from side to side; 'the curse is come upon me,' cried the lady of shalott. part iv in the stormy east-wind straining, the pale yellow woods were waning, the broad stream in his banks complaining, heavily the low sky raining over tower'd camelot; outside the isle a shallow boat beneath a willow lay afloat, below the carven stern she wrote, the lady of shalott. a cloudwhite crown of pearl she dight, all raimented in snowy white that loosely flew (her zone in sight clasp'd with one blinding diamond bright) her wide eyes fix'd on camelot, though the squally east-wind keenly blew, with folded arms serenely by the water stood the queenly lady of shalott. with a steady stony glance— like some bold seer in a trance, beholding all his own mischance, mute, with a glassy countenance— she look'd down to camelot. it was the closing of the day: she loos'd the chain, and down she lay; the broad stream bore her far away, the lady of shalott. as when to sailors while they roam, by creeks and outfalls far from home, rising and dropping with the foam, from dying swans wild warblings come, blown shoreward; so to camelot still as the boathead wound along the willowy hills and fields among, they heard her chanting her deathsong, the lady of shalott. a longdrawn carol, mournful, holy, she chanted loudly, chanted lowly, till her eyes were darken'd wholly, and her smooth face sharpen'd slowly, turn'd to tower'd camelot: for ere she reach'd upon the tide the first house by the water-side, singing in her song she died, the lady of shalott. under tower and balcony, by garden wall and gallery, a pale, pale corpse she floated by, deadcold, between the houses high, dead into tower'd camelot. knight and burgher, lord and dame, to the planked wharfage came: below the stern they read her name, the lady of shalott. they cross'd themselves, their stars they blest, knight, minstrel, abbot, squire, and guest. there lay a parchment on her breast, that puzzled more than all the rest, the wellfed wits at camelot.

'tis true, he was not much inclin'd to fondness for the female kind; not, as his enemies object, from chance, or natural defect; not by his frigid constitution, but through a pious resolution; for he had made a holy vow of chastity as monks do now; which he resolv'd to keep for ever hence, as strictly too, as doth his reverence. apply the tale, and you shall find, how just it suits with human kind. some faults we own: but, can you guess? why?—virtues carried to excess, wherewith our vanity endows us, though neither foe nor friend allows us. the lawyer swears, you may rely on't, he never squeez'd a needy client; and this he makes his constant rule, for which his brethren call him fool: his conscience always was so nice, he freely gave the poor advice; by which he lost, he may affirm, a hundred fees last easter term. while others of the learned robe would break the patience of a job; no pleader at the bar could match his diligence and quick dispatch; ne'er kept a cause, he well may boast, above a term or two at most. the cringing knave, who seeks a place without success, thus tells his case: why should he longer mince the matter? he fail'd because he could not flatter; he had not learn'd to turn his coat, nor for a party give his vote: his crime he quickly understood; too zealous for the nation's good: he found the ministers resent it, yet could not for his heart repent it. the chaplain vows he cannot fawn, though it would raise him to the lawn: he pass'd his hours among his books; you find it in his meagre looks: he might, if he were worldly wise, preferment get and spare his eyes: but own'd he had a stubborn spirit, that made him trust alone in merit: would rise by merit to promotion; alas! a mere chimeric notion. the doctor, if you will believe him, confess'd a sin; and god forgive him! call'd up at midnight, ran to save a blind old beggar from the grave: but see how satan spreads his snares; he quite forgot to say his prayers. he cannot help it for his heart sometimes to act the parson's part: quotes from the bible many a sentence, that moves his patients to repentance: and, when his med'cines do no good, supports their minds with heav'nly food, at which, however well intended, he hears the clergy are offended; and grown so bold behind his back, to call him hypocrite and quack. in his own church he keeps a seat; says grace before and after meat; and calls, without affecting airs, his household twice a day to prayers. he shuns apothecaries' shops; and hates to cram the sick with slops: he scorns to make his art a trade; nor bribes my lady's fav'rite maid. old nurse-keepers would never hire to recommend him to the squire; which others, whom he will not name, have often practis'd to their shame. the statesman tells you with a sneer, his fault is to be too sincere; and, having no sinister ends, is apt to disoblige his friends. the nation's good, his master's glory, without regard to whig or tory, were all the schemes he had in view; yet he was seconded by few: though some had spread a hundred lies, 'twas he defeated the excise. 'twas known, though he had borne aspersion, that standing troops were his aversion: his practice was, in ev'ry station, to serve the king, and please the nation. though hard to find in ev'ry case the fittest man to fill a place: his promises he ne'er forgot, but took memorials on the spot: his enemies, for want of charity, said he affected popularity: 'tis true, the people understood, that all he did was for their good; their kind affections he has tried; no love is lost on either side. he came to court with fortune clear, which now he runs out ev'ry year: must, at the rate that he goes on, inevitably be undone: oh! if his majesty would please to give him but a writ of ease, would grant him licence to retire, as it hath long been his desire, by fair accounts it would be found, he's poorer by ten thousand pound. he owns, and hopes it is no sin, he ne'er was partial to his kin; he thought it base for men in stations to crowd the court with their relations; his country was his dearest mother, and ev'ry virtuous man his brother; through modesty or awkward shame (for which he owns himself to blame), he found the wisest man he could, without respect to friends or blood; nor ever acts on private views, when he hath liberty to choose. the sharper swore he hated play, except to pass an hour away: and well he might; for, to his cost, by want of skill he always lost; he heard there was a club of cheats, who had contriv'd a thousand feats; could change the stock, or cog a die, and thus deceive the sharpest eye: nor wonder how his fortune sunk, his brothers fleece him when he's drunk. i own the moral not exact; besides, the tale is false in fact; and so absurd, that could i raise up from fields elysian fabling aesop; i would accuse him to his face for libelling the four-foot race. creatures of ev'ry kind but ours well comprehend their natural pow'rs; while we, whom reason ought to sway, mistake our talents ev'ry day. the ass was never known so stupid to act the part of tray or cupid; nor leaps upon his master's lap, there to be strok'd, and fed with pap, as aesop would the world persuade; he better understands his trade: nor comes, whene'er his lady whistles; but carries loads, and feeds on thistles. our author's meaning, i presume, is a creature bipes et implumis; wherein the moralist design'd a compliment on human kind: for here he owns, that now and then beasts may degenerate into men. <line>","relationships,pets,arts & sciences,humor & satire"

both. the complacent <line> <line>are resigned to what they understand to be their position. <line> <line>they’re courteous and reliable; class issues only arise <line> <line>when people are rude to them, which they tend to handle fine, <line> <line>though if they say anything about it afterwards, it tends to be <line> <line>a cruel and brief dismissal not only of the occurrence, <line> <line>but of the entire offending person. the entitled <line> <line>have a very complicated expression of social hierarchy. <line> <line>because they see themselves in transition, <line> <line>usually ascending, there’s this idea that their values won’t, <line> <line>or can’t, find full expression from their current position <line> <line>and so they don’t feel compelled to act in a way consistent <line> <line>with their values, while at the same time they may expect <line> <line>to be treated in accordance with those values. when people <line> <line>are rude to them, they flip out. basically

will he now retire after appearance, and again prolong our expectation? god of israel, send thy messiah forth, the time is come; behold the kings of the earth how they oppress thy chosen, to what highth thir pow'r unjust they have exalted, and behind them cast all fear of thee, arise and vindicate thy glory, free thy people from thir yoke, but let us wait; thus far he hath perform'd, sent his anointed, and to us reveal'd him, by his great prophet, pointed at and shown, in publick, and with him we have convers'd; let us be glad of this, and all our fears lay on his providence; he will not fail nor will withdraw him now, nor will recall, mock us with his blest sight, then snatch him hence, soon we shall see our hope, our joy return. thus they out of their plaints new hope resume to find whom at the first they found unsought: but to his mother mary, when she saw others return'd from baptism, not her son, nor left at jordan, tydings of him none; within her brest, though calm; her brest though pure, motherly cares and fears got head, and rais'd some troubl'd thoughts, which she in sighs thus clad. o what avails me now that honour high to have conceiv'd of god, or that salute hale highly favour'd, among women blest; while i to sorrows am no less advanc't, and fears as eminent, above the lot of other women, by the birth i bore, in such a season born when scarce a shed could be obtain'd to shelter him or me from the bleak air; a stable was our warmth, a manger his, yet soon enforc't to flye thence into egypt, till the murd'rous king were dead, who sought his life, and missing fill'd with infant blood the streets of bethlehem; from egypt home return'd, in nazareth hath been our dwelling many years, his life private, unactive, calm, contemplative, little suspicious to any king; but now full grown to man, acknowledg'd, as i hear, by john the baptist, and in publick shown, son own'd from heaven by his father's voice; i look't for some great change; to honour? no, but trouble, as old simeon plain fore-told, that to the fall and rising he should be of many in israel, and to a sign spoken against, that through my very soul a sword shall pierce, this is my favour'd lot, my exaltation to afflictions high; afflicted i may be, it seems, and blest; i will not argue that, nor will repine. but where delays he now? some great intent conceals him: when twelve years he scarce had seen, i lost him, but so found, as well i saw he could not lose himself; but went about his father's business; what he meant i mus'd, since understand; much more his absence now thus long to some great purpose he obscures. but i to wait with patience am inur'd; my heart hath been a store-house long of things and sayings laid up, portending strange events. thus mary pondering oft, and oft to mind recalling what remarkably had pass'd since first her salutation heard, with thoughts meekly compos'd awaited the fulfilling: the while her son tracing the desert wild, sole but with holiest meditations fed, into himself descended, and at once all his great work to come before him set; how to begin, how to accomplish best his end of being on earth, and mission high: for satan with slye preface to return had left him vacant, and with speed was gon up to the middle region of thick air, where all his potentates in council sate; there without sign of boast, or sign of joy, sollicitous and blank he thus began. princes, heavens antient sons, æthereal thrones, demonian spirits now, from the element each of his reign allotted, rightlier call'd, powers of fire, air, water, and earth beneath, so may we hold our place and these mild seats without new trouble; such an enemy is ris'n to invade us, who no less threat'ns then our expulsion down to hell; i, as i undertook, and with the vote consenting in full frequence was impowr'd, have found him, view'd him, tasted him, but find far other labour to be undergon then when i dealt with adam first of men, though adam by his wives allurement fell, however to this man inferior far, if he be man by mothers side at least, with more then humane gifts from heaven adorn'd, perfections absolute, graces divine, and amplitude of mind to greatest deeds. therefore i am return'd, lest confidence of my success with eve in paradise deceive ye to perswasion over-sure of like succeeding here; i summon all rather to be in readiness, with hand or counsel to assist; lest i who erst thought none my equal, now be over-match'd. so spake the old serpent doubting, and from all with clamour was assur'd thir utmost aid at his command; when from amidst them rose belial the dissolutest spirit that fell, the sensuallest, and after asmodai the fleshliest incubus, and thus advis'd. set women in his eye and in his walk, among daughters of men the fairest found; many are in each region passing fair as the noon skie; more like to goddesses then mortal creatures, graceful and discreet, expert in amorous arts, enchanting tongues perswasive, virgin majesty with mild and sweet allay'd, yet terrible to approach, skill'd to retire, and in retiring draw hearts after them tangl'd in amorous nets. such object hath the power to soft'n and tame severest temper, smooth the rugged'st brow, enerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve, draw out with credulous desire, and lead at will the manliest, resolutest brest, as the magnetic hardest iron draws. women, when nothing else, beguil'd the heart of wisest solomon, and made him build, and made him bow to the gods of his wives. to whom quick answer satan thus return'd. belial, in much uneven scale thou weigh'st all others by thy self; because of old thou thy self doat'st on womankind, admiring thir shape, thir colour, and attractive grace, none are, thou think'st, but taken with such toys. before the flood thou with thy lusty crew, false titl'd sons of god, roaming the earth cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men, and coupl'd with them, and begot a race. have we not seen, or by relation heard, in courts and regal chambers how thou lurk'st, in wood or grove by mossie fountain side, in valley or green meadow to way-lay some beauty rare, calisto, clymene, daphne, or semele, antiopa, or amymone, syrinx, many more too long, then lay'st thy scapes on names ador'd, apollo, neptune, jupiter, or pan, satyr, or fawn, or silvan? but these haunts delight not all; among the sons of men, how many have with a smile made small account of beauty and her lures, easily scorn'd all her assaults, on worthier things intent? remember that pellean conquerour, a youth, how all the beauties of the east he slightly view'd, and slightly over-pass'd; how hee sirnam'd of africa dismiss'd in his prime youth the fair iberian maid. for solomon he liv'd at ease, and full of honour, wealth, high fare, aim'd not beyond higher design then to enjoy his state; thence to the bait of women lay expos'd; but he whom we attempt is wiser far then solomon, of more exalted mind, made and set wholly on the accomplishment of greatest things; what woman will you find, though of this age the wonder and the fame, on whom his leisure will vouchsafe an eye of fond desire? or should she confident, as sitting queen ador'd on beauties throne, descend with all her winning charms begirt to enamour, as the zone of venus once wrought that effect on jove, so fables tell; how would one look from his majestick brow seated as on the top of vertues hill, discount'nance her despis'd, and put to rout all her array; her female pride deject, or turn to reverent awe? for beauty stands in the admiration only of weak minds led captive; cease to admire, and all her plumes fall flat and shrink into a trivial toy, at every sudden slighting quite abasht: therefore with manlier objects we must try his constancy, with such as have more shew of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise; rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wreck'd; or that which only seems to satisfie lawful desires of nature, not beyond; and now i know he hungers where no food is to be found, in the wide wilderness; the rest commit to me, i shall let pass no advantage, and his strength as oft assay. he ceas'd, and heard thir grant in loud acclaim; then forthwith to him takes a chosen band of spirits likest to himself in guile to be at hand, and at his beck appear, if cause were to unfold some active scene of various persons each to know his part; then to the desert takes with these his flight; where still from shade to shade the son of god after forty days fasting had remain'd, now hungring first, and to himself thus said. where will this end? four times ten days i have pass'd wandring this woody maze, and humane food nor tasted, nor had appetite; that fast to vertue i impute not, or count part of what i suffer here; if nature need not, or god support nature without repast though needing, what praise is it to endure? but now i feel i hunger, which declares, nature hath need of what she asks; yet god can satisfie that need some other way, though hunger still remain: so it remain without this bodies wasting, i content me, and from the sting of famine fear no harm, nor mind it, fed with better thoughts that feed mee hungring more to do my fathers will. it was the hour of night, when thus the son commun'd in silent walk, then laid him down under the hospitable covert nigh of trees thick interwoven; there he slept, and dream'd, as appetite is wont to dream, of meats and drinks, natures refreshment sweet; him thought, he by the brook of cherith stood and saw the ravens with their horny beaks food to elijah bringing even and morn, though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought: he saw the prophet also how he fled into the desert, and how there he slept under a juniper; then how awakt, he found his supper on the coals prepar'd, and by the angel was bid rise and eat, and eat the second time after repose, the strength whereof suffic'd him forty days; sometimes that with elijah he partook, or as a guest with daniel at his pulse. thus wore out night, and now the herald lark left his ground-nest, high towring to descry the morns approach, and greet her with his song: as lightly from his grassy couch up rose our saviour, and found all was but a dream, fasting he went to sleep, and fasting wak'd. up to a hill anon his steps he rear'd, from whose high top to ken the prospect round, if cottage were in view, sheep-cote or herd; but cottage, herd or sheep-cote none he saw, only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove, with chaunt of tuneful birds resounding loud; thither he bent his way, determin'd there to rest at noon, and entr'd soon the shade high rooft and walks beneath, and alleys brown that open'd in the midst a woody scene, natures own work it seem'd (nature taught art) and to a superstitious eye the haunt of wood-gods and wood-nymphs; he view'd it round, when suddenly a man before him stood, not rustic as before, but seemlier clad, as one in city, or court, or palace bred, and with fair speech these words to him address'd. with granted leave officious i return, but much more wonder that the son of god in this wild solitude so long should bide of all things destitute, and well i know, not without hunger. others of some note, as story tells, have trod this wilderness; the fugitive bond-woman with her son out cast nebaioth, yet found he relief by a providing angel; all the race of israel here had famish'd, had not god rain'd from heaven manna, and that prophet bold native of thebes wandring here was fed twice by a voice inviting him to eat. of thee these forty days none hath regard, forty and more deserted here indeed. to whom thus jesus; what conclud'st thou hence? they all had need, i as thou seest have none. how hast thou hunger then? satan reply'd, tell me if food were now before thee set, would'st thou not eat? thereafter as i like the giver, answer'd jesus. why should that cause thy refusal, said the subtle fiend, hast thou not right to all created things, owe not all creatures by just right to thee duty and service, nor to stay till bid, but tender all their power? nor mention i meats by the law unclean, or offer'd first to idols, those young daniel could refuse; nor proffer'd by an enemy, though who would scruple that, with want opprest? behold nature asham'd, or better to express, troubl'd that thou shouldst hunger, hath purvey'd from all the elements her choicest store to treat thee as beseems, and as her lord with honour, only deign to sit and eat. he spake no dream, for as his words had end, our saviour lifting up his eyes beheld in ample space under the broadest shade a table richly spred, in regal mode, with dishes pill'd, and meats of noblest sort and savour, beasts of chase, or fowl of game, in pastry built, or from the spit, or boyl'd, gris-amber-steam'd; all fish from sea or shore, freshet, or purling brook, of shell or fin, and exquisitest name, for which was drain'd pontus and lucrine bay, and afric coast. alas how simple, to these cates compar'd, was that crude apple that diverted eve! and at a stately side-board by the wine that fragrant smell diffus'd, in order stood tall stripling youths rich clad, of fairer hew then ganymed or hylas, distant more under the trees now trip'd, now solemn stood nymphs of diana's train, and naiades with fruits and flowers from amalthea's horn, and ladies of th' hesperides, that seem'd fairer then feign'd of old, or fabl'd since of fairy damsels met in forest wide by knights of logres, or of lyones, lancelot or pelleas, or pellenore, and all the while harmonious airs were heard of chiming strings, or charming pipes and winds of gentlest gale arabian odors fann'd from their soft wings, and flora's earliest smells. such was the splendour, and the tempter now his invitation earnestly renew'd. what doubts the son of god to sit and eat? these are not fruits forbidden, no interdict defends the touching of these viands pure, thir taste no knowledge works, at least of evil, but life preserves, destroys life's enemy, hunger, with sweet restorative delight. all these are spirits of air, and woods, and springs, thy gentle ministers, who come to pay thee homage, and acknowledge thee thir lord: what doubt'st thou son of god? sit down and eat. to whom thus jesus temperately reply'd: said'st thou not that to all things i had right? and who withholds my pow'r that right to use? shall i receive by gift what of my own, when and where likes me best, i can command? i can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou, command a table in this wilderness, and call swift flights of angels ministrant array'd in glory on my cup to attend: why shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence, in vain, where no acceptance it can find, and with my hunger what has thou to do? thy pompous delicacies i contemn, and count thy specious gifts no gifts but guiles. to whom thus answer'd satan malecontent: that i have also power to give thou seest, if of that pow'r i bring thee voluntary what i might have bestow'd on whom i pleas'd, and rather opportunely in this place chose to impart to thy apparent need, why shouldst thou not accept it? but i see what i can do or offer is suspect; of these things others quickly will dispose whose pains have earn'd the far fet spoil. with that both table and provision vanish'd quite with sound of harpies wings, and talons heard; only the importune tempter still remain'd, and with these words his temptation pursu'd. by hunger, that each other creature tames, thou art not to be harm'd, therefore not mov'd; thy temperance invincible besides, for no allurement yields to appetite, and all thy heart is set on high designs, high actions; but wherewith to be atchiev'd? great acts require great means of enterprise, thou art unknown, unfriended, low of birth, a carpenter thy father known, thy self bred up in poverty and streights at home; lost in a desert here and hunger-bit: which way or from what hope dost thou aspire to greatness? whence authority deriv'st, what followers, what retinue canst thou gain, or at thy heels the dizzy multitude, longer then thou canst feed them on thy cost? money brings honour, friends, conquest, and realms; what rais'd antipater the edomite, and his son herod plac'd on juda's throne; (thy throne) but gold that got him puissant friends? therefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive, get riches first, get wealth, and treasure heap, not difficult, if thou hearken to me, riches are mine, fortune is in my hand; they whom i favour thrive in wealth amain, while virtue, valour, wisdom sit in want. to whom thus jesus patiently reply'd; yet wealth without these three is impotent, to gain dominion or to keep it gain'd. witness those antient empires of the earth, in highth of all thir flowing wealth dissolv'd: but men endu'd with these have oft attain'd in lowest poverty to highest deeds; gideon and jephtha, and the shepherd lad, whose off-spring on the throne of juda sat so many ages, and shall yet regain that seat, and reign in israel without end. among the heathen, (for throughout the world to me is not unknown what hath been done worthy of memorial) canst thou not remember quintius, fabricius, curius, regulus? for i esteem those names of men so poor who could do mighty things, and could contemn riches though offer'd from the hand of kings. and what in me seems wanting, but that i may also in this poverty as soon accomplish what they did, perhaps and more? extol not riches then, the toyl of fools, the wise mans cumbrance if not snare, more apt to slacken virtue, and abate her edge, then prompt her to do aught may merit praise. what if with like aversion i reject riches and realms; yet not for that a crown, golden in shew, is but a wreath of thorns, brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights to him who wears the regal diadem, when on his shoulders each mans burden lies; for therein stands the office of a king, his honour, vertue, merit and chief praise, that for the publick all this weight he bears. yet he who reigns within himself, and rules passions, desires, and fears, is more a king; which every wise and vertuous man attains: and who attains not, ill aspires to rule cities of men or head-strong multitudes, subject himself to anarchy within, or lawless passions in him which he serves. but to guide nations in the way of truth by saving doctrine, and from errour lead to know, and knowing worship god aright, is yet more kingly, this attracts the soul, governs the inner man, the nobler part, that other o're the body only reigns, and oft by force, which to a generous mind so reigning can be no sincere delight. besides to give a kingdom hath been thought greater and nobler done, and to lay down far more magnanimous, then to assume. riches are needless then, both for themselves, and for thy reason why they should be sought, to gain a scepter, oftest better miss't. <line>","religion,christianity,god & the divine"

but him the baptist soon descri'd, divinely warn'd, and witness bore as to his worthier, and would have resign'd to him his heavenly office, nor was long his witness unconfirm'd: on him baptiz'd heaven open'd, and in likeness of a dove the spirit descended, while the fathers voice from heav'n pronounc'd him his beloved son. that heard the adversary, who roving still about the world, at that assembly fam'd would not be last, and with the voice divine nigh thunder-struck, th' exalted man, to whom such high attest was giv'n, a while survey'd with wonder, then with envy fraught and rage flies to his place, nor rests, but in mid air to councel summons all his mighty peers, within thick clouds and dark ten-fold involv'd, a gloomy consistory; and them amidst with looks agast and sad he thus bespake. o ancient powers of air and this wide world, for much more willingly i mention air, this our old conquest, then remember hell our hated habitation; well ye know how many ages, as the years of men, this universe we have possest, and rul'd in manner at our will th' affairs of earth, since adam and his facil consort eve lost paradise deceiv'd by me, though since with dread attending when that fatal wound shall be inflicted by the seed of eve upon my head, long the decrees of heav'n delay, for longest time to him is short; and now too soon for us the circling hours this dreaded time have compast, wherein we must bide the stroak of that long threatn'd wound, at least if so we can, and by the head broken be not intended all our power to be infring'd, our freedom and our being. in this fair empire won of earth and air; for this ill news i bring, the womans seed destin'd to this, is late of woman born, his birth to our just fear gave no small cause, but his growth now to youths full flowr, displaying all vertue, grace and wisdom to atchieve things highest, greatest, multiplies my fear. before him a great prophet, to proclaim his coming, is sent harbinger, who all invites, and in the consecrated stream pretends to wash off sin, and fit them so purified to receive him pure, or rather to do him honour as their king; all come, and he himself among them was baptiz'd, not thence to be more pure, but to receive the testimony of heaven, that who he is thenceforth the nations may not doubt; i saw the prophet do him reverence, on him rising out of the water, heav'n above the clouds unfold her crystal dores, thence on his head a perfect dove descend, what e're it meant, and out of heav'n the sov'raign voice i heard, this is my son belov'd, in him am pleas'd. his mother then is mortal, but his sire, he who obtains the monarchy of heav'n, and what will he not do to advance his son? his first-begot we know, and sore have felt, when his fierce thunder drove us to the deep; who this is we must learn, for man he seems in all his lineaments, though in his face the glimpses of his fathers glory shine. ye see our danger on the utmost edge of hazard, which admits no long debate, but must with something sudden be oppos'd, not force, but well couch't fraud, well woven snares, e're in the head of nations he appear their king, their leader, and supream on earth. i, when no other durst, sole undertook the dismal expedition to find out and ruine adam, and the exploit perform'd successfully; a calmer voyage now will waft me; and the way found prosperous once induces best to hope of like success. he ended, and his words impression left of much amazement to th' infernal crew, distracted and surpriz'd with deep dismay at these sad tidings; but no time was then for long indulgence to their fears or grief: unanimous they all commit the care and management of this main enterprize to him their great dictator, whose attempt at first against mankind so well had thriv'd in adam's overthrow, and led thir march from hell's deep-vaulted den to dwell in light, regents and potentates, and kings, yea gods of many a pleasant realm and province wide. so to the coast of jordan he directs his easie steps; girded with snaky wiles, where he might likeliest find this new-declar'd, this man of men, attested son of god, temptation and all guile on him to try; so to subvert whom he suspected rais'd to end his raign on earth so long enjoy'd: but contrary unweeting he fulfill'd the purpos'd counsel pre-ordain'd and fixt of the most high, who in full frequence bright of angels, thus to gabriel smiling spake. gabriel this day by proof thou shalt behold, thou and all angels conversant on earth with man or mens affairs, how i begin to verifie that solemn message late, on which i sent thee to the virgin pure in galilee, that she should bear a son great in renown, and call'd the son of god; then toldst her doubting how these things could be to her a virgin, that on her should come the holy ghost, and the power of the highest o're-shadow her: this man born and now up-grown, to shew him worthy of his birth divine and high prediction, henceforth i expose to satan; let him tempt and now assay his utmost subtilty, because he boasts and vaunts of his great cunning to the throng of his apostasie; he might have learnt less over-weening, since he fail'd in job, whose constant perseverance overcame whate're his cruel malice could invent. he now shall know i can produce a man of female seed, far abler to resist all his sollicitations, and at length all his vast force, and drive him back to hell, winning by conquest what the first man lost by fallacy surpriz'd. but first i mean to exercise him in the wilderness, there he shall first lay down the rudiments of his great warfare, e're i send him forth to conquer sin and death the two grand foes, by humiliation and strong sufferance: his weakness shall o'recome satanic strength and all the world, and mass of sinful flesh; that all the angels and ætherial powers, they now, and men hereafter may discern, from what consummate vertue i have chose this perfect man, by merit call'd my son, to earn salvation for the sons of men. so spake the eternal father, and all heaven admiring stood a space, then into hymns burst forth, and in celestial measures mov'd, circling the throne and singing, while the hand sung with the voice, and this the argument. victory and triumph to the son of god now entring his great duel, not of arms, but to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles. the father knows the son; therefore secure ventures his filial vertue, though untri'd, against whate're may tempt, whate're seduce, allure, or terrifie, or undermine. be frustrate all ye stratagems of hell, and devilish machinations come to nought. so they in heav'n their odes and vigils tun'd: mean while the son of god, who yet some days lodg'd in bethabara where john baptiz'd, musing and much revolving in his brest, how best the mighty work he might begin of saviour to mankind, and which way first publish his god-like office now mature, one day forth walk'd alone, the spirit leading; and his deep thoughts, the better to converse with solitude, till far from track of men, thought following thought, and step by step led on, he entred now the bordering desert wild, and with dark shades and rocks environ'd round, his holy meditations thus persu'd. o what a multitude of thoughts at once awakn'd in me swarm, while i consider what from within i feel my self, and hear what from without comes often to my ears, ill sorting with my present state compar'd. when i was yet a child, no childish play to me was pleasing, all my mind was set serious to learn and know, and thence to do what might be publick good; my self i thought born to that end, born to promote all truth, all righteous things: therefore above my years, the law of god i read, and found it sweet, made it my whole delight, and in it grew to such perfection, that e're yet my age had measur'd twice six years, at our great feast i went into the temple, there to hear the teachers of our law, and to propose what might improve my knowledge or their own; and was admir'd by all, yet this not all to which my spirit aspir'd, victorious deeds flam'd in my heart, heroic acts, one while to rescue israel from the roman yoke, then to subdue and quell o're all the earth brute violence and proud tyrannick pow'r, till truth were freed, and equity restor'd: yet held it more humane, more heavenly first by winning words to conquer willing hearts, and make perswasion do the work of fear; at least to try, and teach the erring soul not wilfully mis-doing, but unware misled; the stubborn only to destroy. these growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving by words at times cast forth inly rejoyc'd, and said to me apart, high are thy thoughts o son, but nourish them and let them soar to what highth sacred vertue and true worth can raise them, though above example high; by matchless deeds express thy matchless sire. for know, thou art no son of mortal man, though men esteem thee low of parentage, thy father is the eternal king, who rules all heaven and earth, angels and sons of men, a messenger from god fore-told thy birth conceiv'd in me a virgin, he fore-told thou shouldst be great and sit on david's throne, and of thy kingdom there should be no end. at thy nativity a glorious quire of angels in the fields of bethlehem sung to shepherds watching at their folds by night, and told them the messiah now was born, where they might see him, and to thee they came; directed to the manger where thou lais't, for in the inn was left no better room: a star, not seen before in heaven appearing guided the wise men thither from the east, to honour thee with incense, myrrh, and gold, by whose bright course led on they found the place, affirming it thy star new grav'n in heaven, by which they knew thee king of israel born. just simeon and prophetic anna, warn'd by vision, found thee in the temple, and spake before the altar and the vested priest, like things of thee to all that present stood. this having heard, strait i again revolv'd the law and prophets, searching what was writ concerning the messiah, to our scribes known partly, and soon found of whom they spake i am; this chiefly, that my way must lie through many a hard assay even to the death, e're i the promis'd kingdom can attain, or work redemption for mankind, whose sins full weight must be transferr'd upon my head. yet neither thus disheartn'd or dismay'd, the time prefixt i waited, when behold the baptist, (of whose birth i oft had heard, not knew by sight) now come, who was to come before messiah and his way prepare. i as all others to his baptism came, which i believ'd was from above; but he strait knew me, and with loudest voice proclaim'd me him (for it was shew'n him so from heaven) me him whose harbinger he was; and first refus'd on me his baptism to confer, as much his greater, and was hardly won; but as i rose out of the laving stream, heaven open'd her eternal doors, from whence the spirit descended on me like a dove, and last the sum of all, my father's voice, audibly heard from heav'n, pronounc'd me his, me his beloved son, in whom alone he was well pleas'd; by which i knew the time now full, that i no more should live obscure, but openly begin, as best becomes the authority which i deriv'd from heaven. and now by some strong motion i am led into this wilderness, to what intent i learn not yet, perhaps i need not know; for what concerns my knowledge god reveals. so spake our morning star then in his rise, and looking round on every side beheld a pathless desert, dusk with horrid shades; the way he came not having mark'd, return was difficult, by humane steps untrod; and he still on was led, but with such thoughts accompanied of things past and to come lodg'd in his breast, as well might recommend such solitude before choicest society. full forty days he pass'd, whether on hill sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night under the covert of some ancient oak, or cedar, to defend him from the dew, or harbour'd in one cave, is not reveal'd; nor tasted humane food, nor hunger felt till those days ended, hunger'd then at last among wild beasts: they at his sight grew mild, nor sleeping him nor waking harm'd, his walk the fiery serpent fled, and noxious worm, the lion and fierce tiger glar'd aloof. but now an aged man in rural weeds, following, as seem'd, the quest of some stray ewe, or wither'd sticks to gather; which might serve against a winters day when winds blow keen, to warm him wet return'd from field at eve, he saw approach, who first with curious eye perus'd him, then with words thus utt'red spake. sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place so far from path or road of men, who pass in troop or caravan, for single none durst ever, who return'd, and dropt not here his carcass, pin'd with hunger and with droughth? i ask the rather, and the more admire, for that to me thou seem'st the man, whom late our new baptizing prophet at the ford of jordan honour'd so, and call'd thee son of god; i saw and heard, for we sometimes who dwell this wild, constrain'd by want, come forth to town or village nigh (nighest is far) where ought we hear, and curious are to hear, what happ'ns new; fame also finds us out. to whom the son of god. who brought me hither will bring me hence, no other guide i seek. by miracle he may, reply'd the swain, what other way i see not, for we here live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inur'd more then the camel, and to drink go far, men to much misery and hardship born; but if thou be the son of god, command that out of these hard stones be made thee bread; so shalt thou save thy self and us relieve with food, whereof we wretched seldom taste. he ended, and the son of god reply'd. think'st thou such force in bread? is it not written (for i discern thee other then thou seem'st) man lives not by bread only, but each word proceeding from the mouth of god; who fed our fathers here with manna; in the mount moses was forty days, nor eat nor drank, and forty days eliah without food wandred this barren waste, the same i now. why dost thou then suggest to me distrust, knowing who i am, as i know who thou art? whom thus answer'd th' arch fiend now undisguis'd. 'tis true, i am that spirit unfortunate, who leagu'd with millions more in rash revolt kept not my happy station, but was driv'n with them from bliss to the bottomless deep, yet to that hideous place not so confin'd by rigour unconniving, but that oft leaving my dolorous prison i enjoy large liberty to round this globe of earth, or range in th' air, nor from the heav'n of heav'ns hath he excluded my resort sometimes. i came among the sons of god, when he gave up into my hands uzzean job to prove him, and illustrate his high worth; and when to all his angels he propos'd to draw the proud king ahab into fraud that he might fall in ramoth, they demuring, i undertook that office, and the tongues of all his flattering prophets glibb'd with lyes to his destruction, as i had in charge. for what he bids i do; though i have lost much lustre of my native brightness, lost to be belov'd of god, i have not lost to love, at least contemplate and admire what i see excellent in good, or fair, or vertuous, i should so have lost all sense. what can be then less in me then desire to see thee and approach thee, whom i know declar'd the son of god, to hear attent thy wisdom, and behold thy god-like deeds? men generally think me much a foe to all mankind: why should i? they to me never did wrong or violence, by them i lost not what i lost, rather by them i gain'd what i have gain'd, and with them dwell copartner in these regions of the world, if not disposer; lend them oft my aid, oft my advice by presages and signs, and answers, oracles, portents and dreams, whereby they may direct their future life. envy they say excites me, thus to gain companions of my misery and wo. at first it may be; but long since with wo nearer acquainted, now i feel by proof, that fellowship in pain divides not smart, nor lightens aught each mans peculiar load. small consolation then, were man adjoyn'd: this wounds me most (what can it less) that man, man fall'n shall be restor'd, i never more. to whom our saviour sternly thus reply'd. deservedly thou griev'st, compos'd of lyes from the beginning, and in lies wilt end; who boast'st release from hell, and leave to come into the heav'n of heavens; thou com'st indeed, as a poor miserable captive thrall, comes to the place where he before had sat among the prime in splendour, now depos'd, ejected, emptyed, gaz'd, unpityed, shun'd, a spectacle of ruin or of scorn to all the host of heaven; the happy place imparts to thee no happiness, no joy, rather inflames thy torment, representing lost bliss, to thee no more communicable, so never more in hell then when in heaven. but thou art serviceable to heaven's king. wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites? what but thy malice mov'd thee to misdeem of righteous job, then cruelly to afflict him with all inflictions, but his patience won? the other service was thy chosen task, to be a lyer in four hundred mouths; for lying is thy sustenance, thy food. yet thou pretend'st to truth; all oracles by thee are giv'n, and what confest more true among the nations? that hath been thy craft, by mixing somewhat true to vent more lyes. but what have been thy answers, what but dark ambiguous and with double sense deluding, which they who ask'd have seldom understood, and not well understood as good not known? who ever by consulting at thy shrine return'd the wiser, or the more instruct to flye or follow what concern'd him most, and run not sooner to his fatal snare? for god hath justly giv'n the nations up to thy delusions; justly, since they fell idolatrous, but when his purpose is among them to declare his providence to thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth, but from him or his angels president in every province, who themselves disdaining to approach thy temples, give thee in command what to the smallest tittle thou shalt say to thy adorers; thou with trembling fear, or like a fawning parasite obey'st; then to thy self ascrib'st the truth fore-told. but this thy glory shall be soon retrench'd; no more shalt thou by oracling abuse the gentiles; henceforth oracles are ceast, and thou no more with pomp and sacrifice shalt be enquir'd at delphos or elsewhere, at least in vain, for they shall find thee mute. god hath now sent his living oracle into the world, to teach his final will, and sends his spirit of truth henceforth to dwell in pious hearts, an inward oracle to all truth requisite for men to know. so spake our saviour; but the subtle fiend, though inly stung with anger and disdain, dissembl'd, and this answer smooth return'd. sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke, and urg'd me hard with doings, which not will but misery hath rested from me; where easily canst thou find one miserable, and not inforc'd oft-times to part from truth; if it may stand him more in stead to lye, say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure? but thou art plac't above me, thou art lord; from thee i can and must submiss endure check or reproof, and glad to scape so quit. hard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk, smooth on the tongue discourst, pleasing to th' ear, and tuneable as silvan pipe or song; what wonder then if i delight to hear her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire vertue, who follow not her lore: permit me to hear thee when i come (since no man comes) and talk at least, though i despair to attain. thy father, who is holy, wise and pure, suffers the hypocrite or atheous priest to tread his sacred courts, and minister about his altar, handling holy things, praying or vowing, and vouchsaf'd his voice to balaam reprobate, a prophet yet inspir'd; disdain not such access to me. to whom our saviour with unalter'd brow. thy coming hither, though i know thy scope, i bid not or forbid; do as thou find'st permission from above; thou canst not more. he added not; and satan bowing low his gray dissimulation, disappear'd into thin air diffus'd: for now began night with her sullen wing to double-shade the desert, fowls in thir clay nests were couch't; and now wild beasts came forth the woods to roam. <line>","religion,christianity,god & the divine"

a name is a machine. a name is a made-up thing that proposes someone is real. my name is a machine for designation— that’s what any name is. my name is simon walter powers, it proposes i am alive. like my spiritual mentors the immortal walter disney and the immortal walter whitman, my fellow walters and fellow-inventors. and by the way, i have billions of bucks, and i can still sign checks. that’s what! miranda the gestures are unreal and so is the face but this is how he talks and this is his voice. nicholas who is the president of the united states?[the young simon has receded back into the portrait. simon’s voice now emerges from the bird.] simon a man who wants my favor, a man who courts my power, a guy who wants to meet my movie stars, and wants to use my billions. that’s who. miranda daddy, is it you in there?

still in a body? still in this world of meat? simon i appear to you one more time, dear miranda, to explain: like you, i tried to help the world. i, too, saw these miseries, and i’ve tried to heal the world, too. but the animal is defective. it’s not the poor or the starving that hold you back. it’s yourself—i know: i, too, tried to heal the world— but it’s in us, the problem’s in us, it’s in us. we evolved as meat, to love fat and sugar; once that was good, but now it is fatal. we evolved as flesh, to want sex all the time; once that was good, but now it’s only trouble. we evolved as muscle, to want to make war; once that was good, but now that is lethal. our fat and sugar are killing us, our sweetness and abundance kill us, and lead us to famine bigger mcmuck, thicker sweet shake. sexier shaking the sweetness, smarter weapons for meat. meat wants meat, meat wants sweet, meat sweats for the sweets, meat wants who it meets— it kills to eat. now there’s no help but evolving out of the meat, and into the system. it isn’t the many and the few— it’s yourself, it’s you! come! into the world of light! miranda the misery’s part of our being, we don’t need to amputate it. and me, my own misery is part of me. i don’t want to amputate it painful as it is. yes, what about me? with nothing like another person’s body to touch, no body to feel, i can still feel the misery of what i lack. no body to have or be had by, no way to make love. no lover, no other. nothing of the body. with nothing like a mother of flesh and blood, nothing like a father, either alive or dead. can all the earth be disembodied? neither alive nor dead? can we all fall and rise forever? together? are we few rising into the light, while the others sink down into pain? can we help them up when we’re free of meat? who will we touch? i want my sugar, my touch, i want my sweet milk my meat and my misery my touch and my milk— i want my mother! simon what you feel is phantom pain in the amputated limb. leave it, away from the bondage of meat! away from the wars and the sweat! miranda i don’t want to, i want to stay in my body, in this body of sugar and fat, this bondage of sex and war— but my body of sugar and fat, my body of sex and war, my body of death and sweat, is in my mind—it makes me need to be with my pack, my tribe. there in the world of light. simon yes come to the light from the meat! miranda no i won’t amputate my body away from the light. the body of this death is who i am, it is my mind. i am this body of death. simon no, you are not meat, you are light! come with us, leave the meat. leave the death and the sweat. miranda yes i crave to go with my pack because i am this body, body of death and sweat, is where i want to stay. body of death and sweat that i leave behind because i am this body. because i am this body of death, and sweat i’m afraid to be alone.[repeating the following text with building intensity.] who will i be?

what were you thinking?” <line> <line> <line>i said, “i thought what i had covered was the world.”the unsayable: one of the traditional paradoxes of the dead is how they do not emit information. because the dead do not emit light, which cannot escape the event horizon of the deceased, they can only be detected by the symptoms they leave on the surrounding matter, the haloed matter burning at their corona, the white marks scarring the x-rays. a person can survive within the dead once it has gravitationally collapsed. this happens for only a second from the observer’s eye, but, because of gravitational time dilation, grief occurs a nearly infinitely long time for the person who chooses to live inside the dead.tlacuilo, graphic novelist at the world’s end: in those california days after my dad died, i felt the life began to seep out of me into the ground and so i brought my sneakers to the cobbler for resoling, which strangely enough did not mitigate my newfound grief. sometimes i would find myself gazing out the window at the garden my mom cultivated behind her house, often while performing an edwardian pose of wan melancholy, and as i approached, the glass would immediately darken as though saturated with an egglike blue shadow. (i later realized this shadow was caused by my head blocking the lamplight and decided to simply lean back.) i found myself stricken with headaches for some reason when i neglected to eat for days. i began laying my head on the carpet as though listening for footsteps, which i did often in those days, perhaps i believed the sun would itself walk inside and incite me, when i saw a woman in my mother’s backyard. i did not recognize her. <line> <line> <line>she crouched on the ground holding what i thought was a knife. i thought i saw her carving the earth into sections. as i came closer, i saw that what she grasped in her hand was a quill, though she held it with such authority that she looked as though she held the earth by its handle. all the cracks that scrawled between the grass—i saw that these were not cracks. they were sketches. and what a strange thing, looking back on it, how i never wondered what this woman was doing in my mother’s backyard. she glanced up at me as i approached and said, “everyone i know is dead. i am also dead, but someone must stay behind and document my death. i am the only archivist, so i remain suspended between death and history.” <line> <line> <line>i realized what was occurring and asked, selfishly, “so it’s possible to talk to someone who is dead?” <line> <line> <line>“you do it all the time. it’s like what youmna told you to write into your eulogy.” <line> <line> <line>“yeah, okay.” i paused. “but he never remembers to talk back to me.” <line> <line> <line>she took out two cubes, possibly carved from bone, and threw them at my feet. “what’s that for?” i kneeled closer to her. “is this fortune telling?” <line> <line> <line>“it’s your stats and hit points.” <line> <line> <line>i laughed. “you’re sending me into a dungeon?” <line> <line> <line>“no,” she said. “you are going on a pilgrimage. a pilgrimage to hell.”initiation: to prepare for your descent (for there was no question of which direction you would eventually end up), you began your initiation into three domains of sorcery: the silent vows of grief; the generative magics obtained through meditation upon the colonial archive; and apprenticeship into all manner of low-level magics, including wonder-making, liberating demons, clairvoyance of the past, fierce activities, special jumping abilities, control over the three worlds, abridgment of one’s own lifespan through nicotine inhalation, research methods, the augmentation of merit and pleasure by generating poetry using your body, red optic blasts, melancholy of the spleen, a frequent customer stamp card for woorijip korean deli. your first prophesied guru was the tlacuilo, the woman historian who had ventured to the underworld by standing witness at the end of the mexica and the cosmogony of the new world. she had painted omens of the future that now served you as diagrams of the past: the two-headed man who presented his body to moctezuma, the comet whose banner waved across the sky and heralded the origin of the next kingdom, and the pale ghosts in steel skins who came as gods and guests, the ghosts who at the festival of toxcatl came to kill us. one of them sawed off a man’s head, another speared the eye of a warrior who was betrothed to your sister. the tlacuilo led you to the black lake that mexico city had become. you did not know if you were in a fantasy or the past. you were in a fantasy and the past. small skiffs wobbled by, as did wounded bodies that dyed the waters red. surrounded by corpses levitating upon the waters, she taught you the first sorcery, that of death’s erasure. she cut off the hole of your mouth so you could say nothing, nothing commensurate with death, nothing can be commensurate to that dark infinity, and so you lost no breaths and so you followed her from the shores (sores) and the waterline slowly became the horizon line of the sky and you could breathe. white fish flew by, gliding without effort. you looked one in the eye and it sucked its cow lips silently at you. she said that this was atlantis or one of many atlantises and you saw yourself walking beside her on a road towards an underwater city that you could see only as a speck in the far distance. you tripped on the body of a dead man, seemingly chinese, his body weighed down with rock-filled bags. the tlacuilo, who by this time walked far in front of you, came back and told you this man’s name but asked you to stay silent. she led you about a mile further down the road towards the first station set aside for pilgrims such as yourself. here she transmitted another teaching. there will also be other ages after this one, she said. other suns will rise and fall. i will instruct you towards the attainment of a new title: the cowerer from the sun. she taught you how to crawl on the seabed, a weeping hog crawling on hands and knees. my final teaching is this: go in fear of the sun. having said this, she set her own body down in a fetal position and waited for the

the last two cream-filled cakes. <line> <line> <line> <line>eating in silence, a breeze in the half-light, absently <line> <line>thinking of trying not to think, i imagine the bethlehem <line> <line>steel smokestacks above me piping nonstop, the sky <line> <line> <line> <line>wide open without any question, steam and dioxides <line> <line>of carbon and sulfur, hands pressed to the wall as i walk <line> <line>down the corridor to stop myself from falling awake <line> <line> <line> <line>again on the floor in embarrassment. if there’s any use <line> <line>of imagination more productive or time less painful <line> <line>it hasn’t tried hard enough to push through to find me <line> <line> <line> <line>wandering the wings of a ghost-run factory as earth <line> <line>approaches the dark vale cut in the heart of the galaxy. <line> <line>taking shots of the sunbaked fields of putrefaction <line> <line> <line> <line>visible from the observation deck. hoping to capture <line> <line>what i can point to as the way it feels. sensing my hand <line> <line>in what i push away. watching it dissolve into plumes <line> <line> <line> <line>rising like aerosols, or like ghosts of indigenous peoples, <line> <line>or the lump in the throat to keep me from saying that <line> <line>surviving almost everything has felt like having killed it. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>

habit of ghosts <line> <line>of inhabiting timepieces, of conniving their phantom <line> <line> <line> <line>tendrils through parlor air and into the escapements <line> <line>of some inoperative heirloom clock on a mantel shows <line> <line>not the dead’s ongoing interest in their old adversary <line> <line> <line> <line>(plunk) time so much as an urge to return to the hard <line> <line>mechanical kind of being. an erotic lounging to reanimate <line> <line>the long-inert pendulum. as i have felt you banging <line> <line> <line> <line>nights in my machine, jostling the salt from a pretzel. <line> <line>this passion for the material realm after death however <line> <line>refuses to be reconciled with a willingness to destroy <line> <line> <line> <line>(plunk) it while alive. when the last of the human voices <line> <line>told me what i had to do, they rattled off a shopping <line> <line>list of artifacts they wanted thrown down open throats. <line> <line> <line> <line>that left me feeling in on it, chosen, a real fun-time guy <line> <line>albeit somewhat sleep-deprived; detail-oriented, modern, <line> <line>yes, but also dubious, maudlin, bedridden, speechless. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>5 <line> <line> <line> <line>graffiti on the stonework around the service entrance <line> <line>makes the doorway at night look like the mystagogic <line> <line>mouth of a big beast, amphibious, outfitted with fangs, <line> <line> <line> <line>snout, the suggestion of a tongue, throat, and alimentary <line> <line>canal leading to a complex of caves, tunnels, temples . . . <line> <line>there are rooms i won’t enter, at whose threshold i say <line> <line> <line> <line>this is as far as i go, no farther, almost as if i can sense <line> <line>there’s something in there i don’t want to see, or for which <line> <line>to see means having wanted already to forget, unless <line> <line> <line> <line>stepping into the mouth at last, pressed into its damp, <line> <line>the advantage of not knowing is swapped out for the loss <line> <line>of apartness from what you’d held unknown, meaning <line> <line> <line> <line>you don’t come to know it so much as become it, wholly <line> <line>warping into its absorbent fold. i can’t let that happen <line> <line>if it hasn’t already. what draws me on might be thought <line> <line> <line> <line>canine, keen-sighted, but it’s still incapable of divining why <line> <line>the constant hum around or inside me has to choose <line> <line>among being a nocturne of toxic manufacture, the call <line> <line> <line> <line>of what remains of the jungle, or else just another prank <line> <line>on my gullible anatomy. am i not beset in the utmost <line> <line>basement of industry? is that basement itself not beset <line> <line> <line> <line>by the broad, black-green, waxy leaves of mesoamerica? <line> <line>and haven’t i parted those selfsame leaves, discovering me <line> <line>asleep on my own weapon, threat to no one but myself? <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>6 <line> <line> <line> <line>asked again what i miss the most about my former life, <line> <line>i remember to pause this time, look left, a little off-camera <line> <line>an entire snailsdeath, an air of sifting the possibilities, <line> <line> <line> <line>i eliminate certain objects and events from the running <line> <line>right off the bat, such as when their great displeasure <line> <line>brought the gods to turn to darkness all that had been <line> <line> <line> <line>light, submerging mountaintops in stormwater, the gods <line> <line>shocked by their own power, and heartsick to watch <line> <line>their once dear people stippling the surf like little fishes. <line> <line> <line> <line>or when the flaming peccary of a comet struck the earth <line> <line>with much the same effect, waves as high as ziggurats <line> <line>crashing mathematically against our coastlines, scalding <line> <line> <line> <line>plumes of vapor and aerosols tossed into the atmosphere <line> <line>spawning storms to pummel the far side of the earth, <line> <line>approximately 80 percent of all life vanished in a week. <line> <line> <line> <line>or when we squandered that very earth and shat on it <line> <line>with much the same effect, and more or less on purpose, <line> <line>emitting nonstop gases in the flow of our production, <line> <line> <line> <line>shoveling it in as ancient icecaps melted, what difference <line> <line>could another make now. and so i clear my throat, look <line> <line>directly into the camera, and even though it will make me <line> <line> <line> <line>come off bovine in their eyes, i say that what i miss the most <line> <line>has to be those cream-filled cakes i used to like, but then <line> <line>they prod me with their volts and lead me back to the barn. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>7 <line> <line> <line> <line>after the panic grew more of less customary, the pity <line> <line>dissolved into a mobile fogbank, dense, reducing visibility <line> <line>from the rooftop observation deck. mobile in the sense <line> <line> <line> <line>that it possessed mobility, not in the sense that it actually <line> <line>moved. because it didn’t. it just stayed there, reducing <line> <line>visibility but not in the sense that it simply diminished it <line> <line> <line> <line>or diminished it partly. because it didn’t. it pretty much <line> <line>managed to do away with it altogether, as my photography <line> <line>will come to show: field after field of untouched white. <line> <line> <line> <line>after the possibility of change grew funny, threadbare, <line> <line>too embarrassing to be with, i eased into the knowledge <line> <line>that you’d never appear at the foot of the bed, the vale <line> <line> <line> <line>turned into a lifetime’s heap of laundry, and not the gentle <line> <line>tuffets and streambanks of an afterlife it seems we only <line> <line>imagined remembering, that watercolor done in greens <line> <line> <line> <line>and about which i predicted its monotony of fair weather <line> <line>over time might deaden one all over again, unless being <line> <line>changed with death means not only changing past change <line> <line> <line> <line>but past even the wish for it. i worried to aspire towards <line> <line>that condition might actually dull one’s aptitude for change. <line> <line>that i would grow to protect what i wished to keep from <line> <line> <line> <line>change at the cost of perpetuating much that required it. <line> <line>in this sense i had come to resemble the fogbank, at once <line> <line>given to motion but no less motionless than its photograph. <line> <line> <line> <line>the last time i saw myself alive, i drew the curtain back <line> <line>from the bed, stood by my sleeping body. i felt tenderness <line> <line>towards it. i knew how long it had waited, and how little <line> <line> <line> <line>time remained for it to prepare its bundle of grave-goods. <line> <line>when i tried to speak, rather than my voice, my mouth <line> <line>released the tight, distinctive shriek of an aerophone of clay. <line> <line> <line> <line>i wanted to stop the shock of that from taking away from <line> <line>what i felt. i couldn’t quite manage it. even at this late hour, <line> <line>even here, the purity of a feeling is ruined by the world. <line> <line> <line> <line>8 <line> <line> <line> <line>the noises from the basement were not auspicious noises. <line> <line>i wanted to live forever. i wanted to live forever and die <line> <line>right then and there. i had heard the tight, distinctive shriek. <line> <line> <line> <line>here again and now. i no longer have legs. i am sleeping. <line> <line>long tendrils of tobacco smoke, composed of carbon dioxide, <line> <line>water vapor, ammonia, nitrogen oxide, hydrogen cyanide, <line> <line> <line> <line>and 4,000 other chemical compounds, penetrate the room <line> <line>through the gap beneath the door and through heating vents <line> <line>with confidence. they are the spectral forms of anaconda. <line> <line> <line> <line>the ruler of the underworld smokes cigars. a certain brand. <line> <line>hand-rolled. he smiles as if there is much to smile about. <line> <line>and there is. he is hollow-eyed, toothless. his hat, infamous: <line> <line> <line> <line>broad-brimmed, embellished with feathers, a live macaw. <line> <line>his cape is depicted, often, as a length of fabric in distinctive <line> <line>black and white chevrons. otherwise, as here, the full pelt <line> <line> <line> <line>of a jaguar. on a barge of plywood and empty milk cartons <line> <line>he trudges through the froth. he is the lord of black sorcery <line> <line>and lord of percussion. he is patron of commerce. he parts <line> <line> <line> <line>the leaves of mesoamerica, traveling with a retinue of drunken <line> <line>ax wielders, collection agents. his scribe is a white rabbit. <line> <line>daughter of moon and of night. elsewhere, you are having <line> <line> <line> <line>your teeth taken out. there is no music left, but i still feel held <line> <line>captive by the cinema, and in its custom, i believe myself <line> <line>capable of protecting myself by hiding my face in my

and with inspection deep <line> <line>consider'd every creature, which of all <line> <line>most opportune might serve his wiles, and found <line> <line>the serpent suttlest beast of all the field. <line> <line>him after long debate, irresolute <line> <line>of thoughts revolv'd, his final sentence chose <line> <line>fit vessel, fittest imp of fraud, in whom <line> <line>to enter, and his dark suggestions hide <line> <line>from sharpest sight: for in the wilie snake, <line> <line>whatever sleights none would suspicious mark, <line> <line>as from his wit and native suttletie <line> <line>proceeding, which in other beasts observ'd <line> <line>doubt might beget of diabolic pow'r <line> <line>active within beyond the sense of brute. <line> <line>thus he resolv'd, but first from inward griefe <line> <line>his bursting passion into plaints thus pour'd: <line> <line>o earth, how like to heav'n, if not preferr'd <line> <line>more justly, seat worthier of gods, as built <line> <line>with second thoughts, reforming what was old! <line> <line>for what god after better worse would build? <line> <line>terrestrial heav'n, danc't round by other heav'ns <line> <line>that shine, yet bear thir bright officious lamps, <line> <line>light above light, for thee alone, as seems, <line> <line>in thee concentring all thir precious beams <line> <line>of sacred influence: as god in heav'n <line> <line>is center, yet extends to all, so thou <line> <line>centring receav'st from all those orbs; in thee, <line> <line>not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers <line> <line>productive in herb, plant, and nobler birth <line> <line>of creatures animate with gradual life <line> <line>of growth, sense, reason, all summ'd up in man. <line> <line>with what delight could i have walkt thee round, <line> <line>if i could joy in aught, sweet interchange <line> <line>of hill, and vallie, rivers, woods and plaines, <line> <line>now land, now sea, and shores with forrest crownd, <line> <line>rocks, dens, and caves; but i in none of these <line> <line>find place or refuge; and the more i see <line> <line>pleasures about me, so much more i feel <line> <line>torment within me, as from the hateful siege <line> <line>of contraries; all good to me becomes <line> <line>bane, and in heav'n much worse would be my state. <line> <line>but neither here seek i, no nor in heav'n <line> <line>to dwell, unless by maistring heav'ns supreame; <line> <line>nor hope to be my self less miserable <line> <line>by what i seek, but others to make such <line> <line>as i, though thereby worse to me redound: <line> <line>for onely in destroying i find ease <line> <line>to my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd, <line> <line>or won to what may work his utter loss, <line> <line>for whom all this was made, all this will soon <line> <line>follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe, <line> <line>in wo then; that destruction wide may range: <line> <line>to mee shall be the glorie sole among <line> <line>the infernal powers, in one day to have marr'd <line> <line>what he almightie styl'd, six nights and days <line> <line>continu'd making, and who knows how long <line> <line>before had bin contriving, though perhaps <line> <line>not longer then since i in one night freed <line> <line>from servitude inglorious welnigh half <line> <line>th' angelic name, and thinner left the throng <line> <line>of his adorers: hee to be aveng'd, <line> <line>and to repaire his numbers thus impair'd, <line> <line>whether such vertue spent of old now faild <line> <line>more angels to create, if they at least <line> <line>are his created, or to spite us more, <line> <line>determin'd to advance into our room <line> <line>a creature form'd of earth, and him endow, <line> <line>exalted from so base original, <line> <line>with heav'nly spoils, our spoils: what he decreed <line> <line>he effected; man he made, and for him built <line> <line>magnificent this world, and earth his seat, <line> <line>him lord pronounc'd, and, o indignitie! <line> <line>subjected to his service angel wings, <line> <line>and flaming ministers to watch and tend <line> <line>thir earthy charge: of these the vigilance <line> <line>i dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist <line> <line>of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie <line> <line>in every bush and brake, where hap may finde <line> <line>the serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds <line> <line>to hide me, and the dark intent i bring. <line> <line>o foul descent! that i who erst contended <line> <line>with gods to sit the highest, am now constraind <line> <line>into a beast, and mixt with bestial slime, <line> <line>this essence to incarnate and imbrute, <line> <line>that to the hight of deitie aspir'd; <line> <line>but what will not ambition and revenge <line> <line>descend to? who aspires must down as low <line> <line>as high he soard, obnoxious first or last <line> <line>to basest things. revenge, at first though sweet, <line> <line>bitter ere long back on it self recoiles; <line> <line>let it; i reck not, so it light well aim'd, <line> <line>since higher i fall short, on him who next <line> <line>provokes my envie, this new favorite <line> <line>of heav'n, this man of clay, son of despite, <line> <line>whom us the more to spite his maker rais'd <line> <line>from dust: spite then with spite is best repaid. <line> <line>so saying, through each thicket danck or drie, <line> <line>like a black mist low creeping, he held on <line> <line>his midnight search, where soonest he might finde <line> <line>the serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found <line> <line>in labyrinth of many a round self-rowld, <line> <line>his head the midst, well stor'd with suttle wiles: <line> <line>not yet in horrid shade or dismal den, <line> <line>nor nocent yet, but on the grassie herbe <line> <line>fearless unfeard he slept: in at his mouth <line> <line>the devil enterd, and his brutal sense, <line> <line>in heart or head, possessing soon inspir'd <line> <line>with act intelligential, but his sleep <line> <line>disturbd not, waiting close th' approach of morn. <line> <line>now when as sacred light began to dawne <line> <line>in eden on the humid flours, that breathd <line> <line>thir morning incense, when all things that breath, <line> <line>from th' earths great altar send up silent praise <line> <line>to the creator, and his nostrils fill <line> <line>with grateful smell, forth came the human pair <line> <line>and joind thir vocal worship to the quire <line> <line>of creatures wanting voice, that done, partake <line> <line>the season, prime for sweetest sents and aires: <line> <line>then commune how that day they best may ply <line> <line>thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew <line> <line>the hands dispatch of two gardning so wide. <line> <line>and eve first to her husband thus began.adam, well may we labour still to dress <line> <line>this garden, still to tend plant, herb and flour, <line> <line>our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands <line> <line>aid us, the work under our labour grows, <line> <line>luxurious by restraint; what we by day <line> <line>lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, <line> <line>one night or two with wanton growth derides <line> <line>tending to wilde. thou therefore now advise <line> <line>or hear what to my minde first thoughts present, <line> <line>let us divide our labours, thou where choice <line> <line>leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind <line> <line>the woodbine round this arbour, or direct <line> <line>the clasping ivie where to climb, while i <line> <line>in yonder spring of roses intermixt <line> <line>with myrtle, find what to redress till noon: <line> <line>for while so near each other thus all day <line> <line>our taske we choose, what wonder if so near <line> <line>looks intervene and smiles, or object new <line> <line>casual discourse draw on, which intermits <line> <line>our dayes work brought to little, though begun <line> <line>early, and th' hour of supper comes unearn'd. <line> <line>to whom mild answer adam thus return'd. <line> <line>sole eve, associate sole, to me beyond <line> <line>compare above all living creatures deare, <line> <line>well hast thou motion'd, well thy thoughts imployd <line> <line>how we might best fulfill the work which here <line> <line>god hath assign'd us, nor of me shalt pass <line> <line>unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found <line> <line>in woman, then to studie houshold good, <line> <line>and good workes in her husband to promote. <line> <line>yet not so strictly hath our lord impos'd <line> <line>labour, as to debarr us when we need <line> <line>refreshment, whether food, or talk between, <line> <line>food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse <line> <line>of looks and smiles, for smiles from reason flow, <line> <line>to brute deni'd, and are of love the food, <line> <line>love not the lowest end of human life. <line> <line>for not to irksom toile, but to delight <line> <line>he made us, and delight to reason joyn'd. <line> <line>these paths & bowers doubt not but our joynt hands <line> <line>will keep from wilderness with ease, as wide <line> <line>as we need walk, till younger hands ere long <line> <line>assist us: but if much converse perhaps <line> <line>thee satiate, to short absence i could yield. <line> <line>for solitude somtimes is best societie, <line> <line>and short retirement urges sweet returne. <line> <line>but other doubt possesses me, least harm <line> <line>befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst <line> <line>what hath bin warn'd us, what malicious foe <line> <line>envying our happiness, and of his own <line> <line>despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame <line> <line>by sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand <line> <line>watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find <line> <line>his wish and best advantage, us asunder, <line> <line>hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each <line> <line>to other speedie aide might lend at need; <line> <line>whether his first design be to withdraw <line> <line>our fealtie from god, or to disturb <line> <line>conjugal love, then which perhaps no bliss <line> <line>enjoy'd by us excites his envie more; <line> <line>or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side <line> <line>that gave thee being, still shades thee and protects. <line> <line>the wife, where danger or dishonour lurks, <line> <line>safest and seemliest by her husband staies, <line> <line>who guards her, or with her the worst endures. <line> <line>to whom the virgin majestie of eve, <line> <line>as one who loves, and some unkindness meets, <line> <line>with sweet austeer composure thus reply'd, <line> <line>ofspring of heav'n and earth, and all earths lord, <line> <line>that such an enemie we have, who seeks <line> <line>our ruin, both by thee informd i learne, <line> <line>and from the parting angel over-heard <line> <line>as in a shadie nook i stood behind, <line> <line>just then returnd at shut of evening flours. <line> <line>but that thou shouldst my firmness therfore doubt <line> <line>to god or thee, because we have a foe <line> <line>may tempt it, i expected not to hear. <line> <line>his violence thou fearst not, being such, <line> <line>as wee, not capable of death or paine, <line> <line>can either not receave, or can repell. <line> <line>his fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs <line> <line>thy equal fear that my firm faith and love <line> <line>can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't; <line> <line>thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy brestadam, missthought of her to thee so dear? <line> <line>to whom with healing words adam replyd. <line> <line>daughter of god and man, immortal eve, <line> <line>for such thou art, from sin and blame entire: <line> <line>not diffident of thee do i dissuade <line> <line>thy absence from my sight, but to avoid <line> <line>th' attempt it self, intended by our foe. <line> <line>for hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses <line> <line>the tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd <line> <line>not incorruptible of faith, not prooff <line> <line>against temptation: thou thy self with scorne <line> <line>and anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong, <line> <line>though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, <line> <line>if such affront i labour to avert <line> <line>from thee alone, which on us both at once <line> <line>the enemie, though bold, will hardly dare, <line> <line>or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light. <line> <line>nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; <line> <line>suttle he needs must be, who could seduce <line> <line>angels, nor think superfluous others aid. <line> <line>i from the influence of thy looks receave <line> <line>access in every vertue, in thy sight <line> <line>more wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were <line> <line>of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, <line> <line>shame to be overcome or over-reacht <line> <line>would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite. <line> <line>why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel <line> <line>when i am present, and thy trial choose <line> <line>with me, best witness of thy vertue tri'd. <line> <line>so spake domestick adam in his care <line> <line>and matrimonial love; but eve, who thought <line> <line>less attributed to her faith sincere, <line> <line>thus her reply with accent sweet renewd. <line> <line>if this be our condition, thus to dwell <line> <line>in narrow circuit strait'nd by a foe, <line> <line>suttle or violent, we not endu'd <line> <line>single with like defence, wherever met, <line> <line>how are we happie, still in fear of harm? <line> <line>but harm precedes not sin: onely our foe <line> <line>tempting affronts us with his foul esteem <line> <line>of our integritie: his foul esteeme <line> <line>sticks no dishonour on our front, but turns <line> <line>foul on himself; then wherefore shund or feard <line> <line>by us? who rather double honour gaine <line> <line>from his surmise prov'd false, find peace within, <line> <line>favour from heav'n, our witness from th' event. <line> <line>and what is faith, love, vertue unassaid <line> <line>alone, without exterior help sustaind? <line> <line>let us not then suspect our happie state <line> <line>left so imperfet by the maker wise, <line> <line>as not secure to single or combin'd. <line> <line>fraile is our happiness, if this be so, <line> <line>and eden were no eden thus expos'd. <line> <line>to whom thus adam fervently repli'd. <line> <line>o woman, best are all things as the will <line> <line>of god ordain'd them, his creating hand <line> <line>nothing imperfet or deficient left <line> <line>of all that he created, much less man, <line> <line>or aught that might his happie state secure, <line> <line>secure from outward force; within himself <line> <line>the danger lies, yet lies within his power: <line> <line>against his will he can receave no harme. <line> <line>but god left free the will, for what obeyes <line> <line>reason, is free, and reason he made right, <line> <line>but bid her well beware, and still erect, <line> <line>least by some faire appeering good surpris'd <line> <line>she dictate false, and misinforme the will <line> <line>to do what god expressly hath forbid. <line> <line>not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes, <line> <line>that i should mind thee oft, and mind thou me. <line> <line>firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve, <line> <line>since reason not impossibly may meet <line> <line>some specious object by the foe subornd, <line> <line>and fall into deception unaware, <line> <line>not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd. <line> <line>seek not temptation then, which to avoide <line> <line>were better, and most likelie if from mee <line> <line>thou sever not: trial will come unsought. <line> <line>wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve <line> <line>first thy obedience; th' other who can know, <line> <line>not seeing thee attempted, who attest? <line> <line>but if thou think, trial unsought may finde <line> <line>us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst, <line> <line>go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; <line> <line>go in thy native innocence, relie <line> <line>on what thou hast of vertue, summon all, <line> <line>for god towards thee hath done his part, do thine. <line> <line>so spake the patriarch of mankinde, but eve <line> <line>persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd. <line> <line>with thy permission then, and thus forewarnd <line> <line>chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words <line> <line>touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought, <line> <line>may finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd, <line> <line>the willinger i goe, nor much expect <line> <line>a foe so proud will first the weaker seek; <line> <line>so bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. <line> <line>thus saying, from her husbands hand her hand <line> <line>soft she withdrew, and like a wood-nymph lightoread or dryad, or of delia's traine, <line> <line>betook her to the groves, but delia's self <line> <line>in gate surpass'd and goddess-like deport, <line> <line>though not as shee with bow and quiver armd, <line> <line>but with such gardning tools as art yet rude, <line> <line>guiltless of fire had formd, or angels brought. <line> <line>to pales, or pomona thus adornd, <line> <line>likeliest she seemd, pomona when she fledvertumnus, or to ceres in her prime, <line> <line>yet virgin of proserpina from jove. <line> <line>her long with ardent look his eye pursu'd <line> <line>delighted, but desiring more her stay. <line> <line>oft he to her his charge of quick returne <line> <line>repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd <line> <line>to be returnd by noon amid the bowre, <line> <line>and all things in best order to invite <line> <line>noontide repast, or afternoons repose. <line> <line>o much deceav'd, much failing, hapless eve, <line> <line>of thy presum'd return! event perverse! <line> <line>thou never from that houre in paradise <line> <line>foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose; <line> <line>such ambush hid among sweet flours and shades <line> <line>waited with hellish rancour imminent <line> <line>to intercept thy way, or send thee back <line> <line>despoild of innocence, of faith, of bliss. <line> <line>for now, and since first break of dawne the fiend, <line> <line>meer serpent in appearance, forth was come, <line> <line>and on his quest, where likeliest he might finde <line> <line>the onely two of mankinde, but in them <line> <line>the whole included race, his purposd prey. <line> <line>in bowre and field he sought, where any tuft <line> <line>of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay, <line> <line>thir tendance or plantation for delight, <line> <line>by fountain or by shadie rivulet <line> <line>he sought them both, but wish'd his hap might findeve separate, he wish'd, but not with hope <line> <line>of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish, <line> <line>beyond his hope, eve separate he spies, <line> <line>veild in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood, <line> <line>half spi'd, so thick the roses bushing round <line> <line>about her glowd, oft stooping to support <line> <line>each flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay <line> <line>carnation, purple, azure, or spect with gold, <line> <line>hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies <line> <line>gently with mirtle band, mindless the while, <line> <line>her self, though fairest unsupported flour, <line> <line>from her best prop so farr, and storm so nigh. <line> <line>neerer he drew, and many a walk travers'd <line> <line>of stateliest covert, cedar, pine, or palme, <line> <line>then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen <line> <line>among thick-wov'n arborets and flours <line> <line>imborderd on each bank, the hand of eve: <line> <line>spot more delicious then those gardens feign'd <line> <line>or of reviv'd adonis, or renowndalcinous, host of old laertes son, <line> <line>or that, not mystic, where the sapient king <line> <line>held dalliance with his faire egyptian spouse. <line> <line>much hee the place admir'd, the person more. <line> <line>as one who long in populous city pent, <line> <line>where houses thick and sewers annoy the aire, <line> <line>forth issuing on a summers morn to breathe <line> <line>among the pleasant villages and farmes <line> <line>adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight, <line> <line>the smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine, <line> <line>or dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound; <line> <line>if chance with nymphlike step fair virgin pass, <line> <line>what pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more, <line> <line>she most, and in her look summs all delight. <line> <line>such pleasure took the serpent to behold <line> <line>this flourie plat, the sweet recess of eve <line> <line>thus earlie, thus alone; her heav'nly forme <line> <line>angelic, but more soft, and feminine, <line> <line>her graceful innocence, her every aire <line> <line>of gesture or lest action overawd <line> <line>his malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd <line> <line>his fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: <line> <line>that space the evil one abstracted stood <line> <line>from his own evil, and for the time remaind <line> <line>stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd, <line> <line>of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge; <line> <line>but the hot hell that alwayes in him burnes, <line> <line>though in mid heav'n, soon ended his delight, <line> <line>and tortures him now more, the more he sees <line> <line>of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon <line> <line>fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts <line> <line>of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. <line> <line>thoughts, whither have ye led me, with what sweet <line> <line>compulsion thus transported to forget <line> <line>what hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope <line> <line>of paradise for hell, hope here to taste <line> <line>of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy, <line> <line>save what is in destroying, other joy <line> <line>to me is lost. then let me not let pass <line> <line>occasion which now smiles, behold alone <line> <line>the woman, opportune to all attempts, <line> <line>her husband, for i view far round, not nigh, <line> <line>whose higher intellectual more i shun, <line> <line>and strength, of courage hautie, and of limb <line> <line>heroic built, though of terrestrial mould, <line> <line>foe not informidable, exempt from wound, <line> <line>i not; so much hath hell debas'd, and paine <line> <line>infeebl'd me, to what i was in heav'n. <line> <line>shee fair, divinely fair, fit love for gods, <line> <line>not terrible, though terrour be in love <line> <line>and beautie, not approacht by stronger hate, <line> <line>hate stronger, under shew of love well feign'd, <line> <line>the way which to her ruin now i tend. <line> <line>so spake the enemie of mankind, enclos'd <line> <line>in serpent, inmate bad, and toward eve <line> <line>address'd his way, not with indented wave, <line> <line>prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare, <line> <line>circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd <line> <line>fould above fould a surging maze, his head <line> <line>crested aloft, and carbuncle his eyes; <line> <line>with burnisht neck of verdant gold, erect <line> <line>amidst his circling spires, that on the grass <line> <line>floted redundant: pleasing was his shape, <line> <line>and lovely, never since of serpent kind <line> <line>lovelier, not those that in illyria chang'dhermione and cadmus, or the god <line> <line>in epidaurus; nor to which transformdammonian jove, or capitoline was seen, <line> <line>hee with olympias, this with her who borescipio the highth of rome. with tract oblique <line> <line>at first, as one who sought access, but feard <line> <line>to interrupt, side-long he works his way. <line> <line>as when a ship by skilful stearsman wrought <line> <line>nigh rivers mouth or foreland, where the wind <line> <line>veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her saile; <line> <line>so varied hee, and of his tortuous traine <line> <line>curld many a wanton wreath in sight of eve, <line> <line>to lure her eye; shee busied heard the sound <line> <line>of rusling leaves, but minded not, as us'd <line> <line>to such disport before her through the field, <line> <line>from every beast, more duteous at her call, <line> <line>then at circean call the herd disguis'd. <line> <line>hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood; <line> <line>but as in gaze admiring: oft he bowd <line> <line>his turret crest, and sleek enamel'd neck, <line> <line>fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod. <line> <line>his gentle dumb expression turnd at length <line> <line>the eye of eve to mark his play; he glad <line> <line>of her attention gaind, with serpent tongue <line> <line>organic, or impulse of vocal air, <line> <line>his fraudulent temptation thus began. <line> <line>wonder not, sovran mistress, if perhaps <line> <line>thou canst, who art sole wonder, much less arm <line> <line>thy looks, the heav'n of mildness, with disdain, <line> <line>displeas'd that i approach thee thus, and gaze <line> <line>insatiate, i thus single, nor have feard <line> <line>thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd. <line> <line>fairest resemblance of thy maker faire, <line> <line>thee all things living gaze on, all things thine <line> <line>by gift, and thy celestial beautie adore <line> <line>with ravishment beheld, there best beheld <line> <line>where universally admir'd; but here <line> <line>in this enclosure wild, these beasts among, <line> <line>beholders rude, and shallow to discerne <line> <line>half what in thee is fair, one man except, <line> <line>who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen <line> <line>a goddess among gods, ador'd and serv'd <line> <line>by angels numberless, thy daily train. <line> <line>so gloz'd the tempter, and his proem tun'd; <line> <line>into the heart of eve his words made way, <line> <line>though at the voice much marveling; at length <line> <line>not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake. <line> <line>what may this mean? language of man pronounc't <line> <line>by tongue of brute, and human sense exprest? <line> <line>the first at lest of these i thought deni'd <line> <line>to beasts, whom god on thir creation-day <line> <line>created mute to all articulat sound; <line> <line>the latter i demurre, for in thir looks <line> <line>much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers. <line> <line>thee, serpent, suttlest beast of all the field <line> <line>i knew, but not with human voice endu'd; <line> <line>redouble then this miracle, and say, <line> <line>how cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how <line> <line>to me so friendly grown above the rest <line> <line>of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? <line> <line>say, for such wonder claims attention due. <line> <line>to whom the guileful tempter thus reply'd. <line> <line>empress of this fair world, resplendent eve, <line> <line>easie to mee it is to tell thee all <line> <line>what thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd: <line> <line>i was at first as other beasts that graze <line> <line>the trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low, <line> <line>as was my food, nor aught but food discern'd <line> <line>or sex, and apprehended nothing high: <line> <line>till on a day roaving the field, i chanc'd <line> <line>a goodly tree farr distant to behold <line> <line>loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt, <line> <line>ruddie and gold: i nearer drew to gaze; <line> <line>when from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n, <line> <line>grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense <line> <line>then smell of sweetest fenel or the teats <line> <line>of ewe or goat dropping with milk at eevn, <line> <line>unsuckt of lamb or kid, that tend thir play. <line> <line>to satisfie the sharp desire i had <line> <line>of tasting those fair apples, i resolv'd <line> <line>not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once, <line> <line>powerful perswaders, quick'nd at the scent <line> <line>of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene. <line> <line>about the mossie trunk i wound me soon, <line> <line>for high from ground the branches would require <line> <line>thy utmost reach or adams: round the tree <line> <line>all other beasts that saw, with like desire <line> <line>longing and envying stood, but could not reach. <line> <line>amid the tree now got, where plenty hung <line> <line>tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill <line> <line>i spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour <line> <line>at feed or fountain never had i found. <line> <line>sated at length, ere long i might perceave <line> <line>strange alteration in me, to degree <line> <line>of reason in my inward powers, and speech <line> <line>wanted not long, though to this shape retain'd. <line> <line>thenceforth to speculations high or deep <line> <line>i turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind <line> <line>considerd all things visible in heav'n, <line> <line>or earth, or middle, all things fair and good; <line> <line>but all that fair and good in thy divine <line> <line>semblance, and in thy beauties heav'nly ray <line> <line>united i beheld; no fair to thine <line> <line>equivalent or second, which compel'd <line> <line>mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come <line> <line>and gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd <line> <line>sovran of creatures, universal dame. <line> <line>so talk'd the spirited sly snake; and eve <line> <line>yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd. <line> <line>serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt <line> <line>the vertue of that fruit, in thee first prov'd: <line> <line>but say, where grows the tree, from hence how far? <line> <line>for many are the trees of god that grow <line> <line>in paradise, and various, yet unknown <line> <line>to us, in such aboundance lies our choice, <line> <line>as leaves a greater store of fruit untoucht, <line> <line>still hanging incorruptible, till men <line> <line>grow up to thir provision, and more hands <line> <line>help to disburden nature of her bearth. <line> <line>to whom the wilie adder, blithe and glad. <line> <line>empress, the way is readie, and not long, <line> <line>beyond a row of myrtles, on a flat, <line> <line>fast by a fountain, one small thicket past <line> <line>of blowing myrrh and balme; if thou accept <line> <line>my conduct, i can bring thee thither soon. <line> <line>lead then, said eve. hee leading swiftly rowld <line> <line>in tangles, and made intricate seem strait, <line> <line>to mischief swift. hope elevates, and joy <line> <line>bright'ns his crest, as when a wandring fire, <line> <line>compact of unctuous vapor, which the night <line> <line>condenses, and the cold invirons round, <line> <line>kindl'd through agitation to a flame, <line> <line>which oft, they say, some evil spirit attends <line> <line>hovering and blazing with delusive light, <line> <line>misleads th' amaz'd night-wanderer from his way <line> <line>to boggs and mires, and oft through pond or poole, <line> <line>there swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr. <line> <line>so glister'd the dire snake, and into fraud <line> <line>led eve our credulous mother, to the tree <line> <line>of prohibition, root of all our woe; <line> <line>which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. <line> <line>serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither, <line> <line>fruitless to mee, though fruit be here to excess, <line> <line>the credit of whose vertue rest with thee, <line> <line>wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects. <line> <line>but of this tree we may not taste nor touch; <line> <line>god so commanded, and left that command <line> <line>sole daughter of his voice; the rest, we live <line> <line>law to our selves, our reason is our law. <line> <line>to whom the tempter guilefully repli'd. <line> <line>indeed? hath god then said that of the fruit <line> <line>of all these garden trees ye shall not eate, <line> <line>yet lords declar'd of all in earth or aire? <line> <line>to whom thus eve yet sinless. of the fruit <line> <line>of each tree in the garden we may eate, <line> <line>but of the fruit of this fair tree amidst <line> <line>the garden, god hath said, ye shall not eate <line> <line>thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die. <line> <line>she scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold <line> <line>the tempter, but with shew of zeale and love <line> <line>to man, and indignation at his wrong, <line> <line>new part puts on, and as to passion mov'd, <line> <line>fluctuats disturbd, yet comely and in act <line> <line>rais'd, as of som great matter to begin. <line> <line>as when of old som orator renound <line> <line>in athens or free rome, where eloquence <line> <line>flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest, <line> <line>stood in himself collected, while each part, <line> <line>motion, each act won audience ere the tongue, <line> <line>somtimes in highth began, as no delay <line> <line>of preface brooking through his zeal of right. <line> <line>so standing, moving, or to highth upgrown <line> <line>the tempter all impassiond thus began. <line> <line>o sacred, wise, and wisdom-giving plant, <line> <line>mother of science, now i feel thy power <line> <line>within me cleere, not onely to discerne <line> <line>things in thir causes, but to trace the wayes <line> <line>of highest agents, deemd however wise. <line> <line>queen of this universe, doe not believe <line> <line>those rigid threats of death; ye shall not die: <line> <line>how should ye? by the fruit? it gives you life <line> <line>to knowledge? by the threatner, look on mee, <line> <line>mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live, <line> <line>and life more perfet have attaind then fate <line> <line>meant mee, by ventring higher then my lot. <line> <line>shall that be shut to man, which to the beast <line> <line>is open? or will god incense his ire <line> <line>for such a petty trespass, and not praise <line> <line>rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain <line> <line>of death denounc't, whatever thing death be, <line> <line>deterrd not from atchieving what might leade <line> <line>to happier life, knowledge of good and evil; <line> <line>of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil <line> <line>be real, why not known, since easier shunnd? <line> <line>god therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; <line> <line>not just, not god; not feard then, nor obeyd: <line> <line>your feare it self of death removes the feare. <line> <line>why then was this forbid? why but to awe, <line> <line>why but to keep ye low and ignorant, <line> <line>his worshippers; he knows that in the day <line> <line>ye eate thereof, your eyes that seem so cleere, <line> <line>yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then <line> <line>op'nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as gods, <line> <line>knowing both good and evil as they know. <line> <line>that ye should be as gods, since i as man, <line> <line>internal man, is but proportion meet, <line> <line>i of brute human, yee of human gods. <line> <line>so ye shall die perhaps, by putting off <line> <line>human, to put on gods, death to be wisht, <line> <line>though threat'nd, which no worse then this can bring. <line> <line>and what are gods that man may not become <line> <line>as they, participating god-like food? <line> <line>the gods are first, and that advantage use <line> <line>on our belief, that all from them proceeds; <line> <line>i question it, for this fair earth i see, <line> <line>warm'd by the sun, producing every kind, <line> <line>them nothing: if they all things, who enclos'd <line> <line>knowledge of good and evil in this tree, <line> <line>that whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains <line> <line>wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies <line> <line>th' offence, that man should thus attain to know? <line> <line>what can your knowledge hurt him, or this tree <line> <line>impart against his will if all be his? <line> <line>or is it envie, and can envie dwell <line> <line>in heav'nly breasts? these, these and many more <line> <line>causes import your need of this fair fruit. <line> <line>goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste. <line> <line>he ended, and his words replete with guile <line> <line>into her heart too easie entrance won: <line> <line>fixt on the fruit she gaz'd, which to behold <line> <line>might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound <line> <line>yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn'd <line> <line>with reason, to her seeming, and with truth; <line> <line>mean while the hour of noon drew on, and wak'd <line> <line>an eager appetite, rais'd by the smell <line> <line>so savorie of that fruit, which with desire, <line> <line>inclinable now grown to touch or taste, <line> <line>sollicited her longing eye; yet first <line> <line>pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd. <line> <line>great are thy vertues, doubtless, best of fruits, <line> <line>though kept from man, and worthy to be admir'd, <line> <line>whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay <line> <line>gave elocution to the mute, and taught <line> <line>the tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise: <line> <line>thy praise hee also who forbids thy use, <line> <line>conceales not from us, naming thee the tree <line> <line>of knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil; <line> <line>forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding <line> <line>commends thee more, while it inferrs the good <line> <line>by thee communicated, and our want: <line> <line>for good unknown, sure is not had, or had <line> <line>and yet unknown, is as not had at all. <line> <line>in plain then, what forbids he but to know, <line> <line>forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? <line> <line>such prohibitions binde not. but if death <line> <line>bind us with after-bands, what profits then <line> <line>our inward freedom? in the day we eate <line> <line>of this fair fruit, our doom is, we shall die. <line> <line>how dies the serpent? hee hath eat'n and lives, <line> <line>and knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns, <line> <line>irrational till then. for us alone <line> <line>was death invented? or to us deni'd <line> <line>this intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd? <line> <line>for beasts it seems: yet that one beast which first <line> <line>hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy <line> <line>the good befall'n him, author unsuspect, <line> <line>friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile. <line> <line>what fear i then, rather what know to feare <line> <line>under this ignorance of good and evil, <line> <line>of god or death, of law or penaltie? <line> <line>here grows the cure of all, this fruit divine, <line> <line>fair to the eye, inviting to the taste, <line> <line>of vertue to make wise: what hinders then <line> <line>to reach, and feed at once both bodie and mind? <line> <line>so saying, her rash hand in evil hour <line> <line>forth reaching to the fruit, she pluck'd, she eat: <line> <line>earth felt the wound, and nature from her seat <line> <line>sighing through all her works gave signs of woe, <line> <line>that all was lost. back to the thicket slunk <line> <line>the guiltie serpent, and well might, for eve <line> <line>intent now wholly on her taste, naught else <line> <line>regarded, such delight till then, as seemd, <line> <line>in fruit she never tasted, whether true <line> <line>or fansied so, through expectation high <line> <line>of knowledg, nor was god-head from her thought. <line> <line>greedily she ingorg'd without restraint, <line> <line>and knew not eating death: satiate at length, <line> <line>and hight'nd as with wine, jocond and boon, <line> <line>thus to her self she pleasingly began. <line> <line>o sovran, vertuous, precious of all trees <line> <line>in paradise, of operation blest <line> <line>to sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd, <line> <line>and thy fair fruit let hang, as to no end <line> <line>created; but henceforth my early care, <line> <line>not without song, each morning, and due praise <line> <line>shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease <line> <line>of thy full branches offer'd free to all; <line> <line>till dieted by thee i grow mature <line> <line>in knowledge, as the gods who all things know; <line> <line>though others envie what they cannot give; <line> <line>for had the gift bin theirs, it had not here <line> <line>thus grown. experience, next to thee i owe, <line> <line>best guide; not following thee, i had remaind <line> <line>in ignorance, thou op'nst wisdoms way, <line> <line>and giv'st access, though secret she retire. <line> <line>and i perhaps am secret; heav'n is high, <line> <line>high and remote to see from thence distinct <line> <line>each thing on earth; and other care perhaps <line> <line>may have diverted from continual watch <line> <line>our great forbidder, safe with all his spies <line> <line>about him. but to adam in what sort <line> <line>shall i appeer? shall i to him make known <line> <line>as yet my change, and give him to partake <line> <line>full happiness with mee, or rather not, <line> <line>but keep the odds of knowledge in my power <line> <line>without copartner? so to add what wants <line> <line>in femal sex, the more to draw his love, <line> <line>and render me more equal, and perhaps, <line> <line>a thing not undesireable, somtime <line> <line>superior; for inferior who is free? <line> <line>this may be well: but what if god have seen, <line> <line>and death ensue? then i shall be no more, <line> <line>and adam wedded to another eve, <line> <line>shall live with her enjoying, i extinct; <line> <line>a death to think. confirm'd then i resolve;adam shall share with me in bliss or woe: <line> <line>so dear i love him, that with him all deaths <line> <line>i could endure, without him live no life. <line> <line>so saying, from the tree her step she turnd, <line> <line>but first low reverence don, as to the power <line> <line>that dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd <line> <line>into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd <line> <line>from nectar, drink of gods. adam the while <line> <line>waiting desirous her return, had wove <line> <line>of choicest flours a garland to adorne <line> <line>her tresses, and her rural labours crown, <line> <line>as reapers oft are wont thir harvest queen. <line> <line>great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new <line> <line>solace in her return, so long delay'd; <line> <line>yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill, <line> <line>misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt; <line> <line>and forth to meet her went, the way she took <line> <line>that morn when first they parted; by the tree <line> <line>of knowledge he must pass, there he her met, <line> <line>scarse from the tree returning; in her hand <line> <line>a bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd, <line> <line>new gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd. <line> <line>to him she hasted, in her face excuse <line> <line>came prologue, and apologie to prompt, <line> <line>which with bland words at will she thus addrest. <line> <line>hast thou not wonderd, adam, at my stay? <line> <line>thee i have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd <line> <line>thy presence, agonie of love till now <line> <line>not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more <line> <line>mean i to trie, what rash untri'd i sought, <line> <line>the pain of absence from thy sight. but strange <line> <line>hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare: <line> <line>this tree is not as we are told, a tree <line> <line>of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown <line> <line>op'ning the way, but of divine effect <line> <line>to open eyes, and make them gods who taste; <line> <line>and hath bin tasted such: the serpent wise, <line> <line>or not restraind as wee, or not obeying, <line> <line>hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become, <line> <line>not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth <line> <line>endu'd with human voice and human sense, <line> <line>reasoning to admiration, and with mee <line> <line>perswasively hath so prevaild, that i <line> <line>have also tasted, and have also found <line> <line>th' effects to correspond, opener mine eyes, <line> <line>dimm erst, dilated spirits, ampler heart, <line> <line>and growing up to godhead; which for thee <line> <line>chiefly i sought, without thee can despise. <line> <line>for bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss, <line> <line>tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon. <line> <line>thou therefore also taste, that equal lot <line> <line>may joyne us, equal joy, as equal love; <line> <line>least thou not tasting, different degree <line> <line>disjoyne us, and i then too late renounce <line> <line>deitie for thee, when fate will not permit. <line> <line>thus eve with countnance blithe her storie told; <line> <line>but in her cheek distemper flushing glowd. <line> <line>on th' other side, adam, soon as he heard <line> <line>the fatal trespass don by eve, amaz'd, <line> <line>astonied stood and blank, while horror chill <line> <line>ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd; <line> <line>from his slack hand the garland wreath'd for eve <line> <line>down drop'd, and all the faded roses shed: <line> <line>speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length <line> <line>first to himself he inward silence broke. <line> <line>o fairest of creation, last and best <line> <line>of all gods works, creature in whom excell'd <line> <line>whatever can to sight or thought be formd, <line> <line>holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! <line> <line>how art thou lost, how on a sudden lost, <line> <line>defac't, deflourd, and now to death devote? <line> <line>rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress <line> <line>the strict forbiddance, how to violate <line> <line>the sacred fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud <line> <line>of enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown, <line> <line>and mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee <line> <line>certain my resolution is to die; <line> <line>how can i live without thee, how forgoe <line> <line>thy sweet converse and love so dearly joyn'd, <line> <line>to live again in these wilde woods forlorn? <line> <line>should god create another eve, and i <line> <line>another rib afford, yet loss of thee <line> <line>would never from my heart; no no, i feel <line> <line>the link of nature draw me: flesh of flesh, <line> <line>bone of my bone thou art, and from thy state <line> <line>mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. <line> <line>so having said, as one from sad dismay <line> <line>recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd <line> <line>submitting to what seemd remediless, <line> <line>thus in calm mood his words to eve he turnd. <line> <line>bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous eve, <line> <line>and peril great provok't, who thus hath dar'd <line> <line>had it been onely coveting to eye <line> <line>that sacred fruit, sacred to abstinence, <line> <line>much more to taste it under banne to touch. <line> <line>but past who can recall, or don undoe? <line> <line>not god omnipotent, nor fate, yet so <line> <line>perhaps thou shalt not die, perhaps the fact <line> <line>is not so hainous now, foretasted fruit, <line> <line>profan'd first by the serpent, by him first <line> <line>made common and unhallowd ere our taste; <line> <line>nor yet on him found deadly, he yet lives, <line> <line>lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as man <line> <line>higher degree of life, inducement strong <line> <line>to us, as likely tasting to attaine <line> <line>proportional ascent, which cannot be <line> <line>but to be gods, or angels demi-gods. <line> <line>nor can i think that god, creator wise, <line> <line>though threatning, will in earnest so destroy <line> <line>us his prime creatures, dignifi'd so high, <line> <line>set over all his works, which in our fall, <line> <line>for us created, needs with us must faile, <line> <line>dependent made; so god shall uncreate, <line> <line>be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose, <line> <line>not well conceav'd of god, who though his power <line> <line>creation could repeate, yet would be loath <line> <line>us to abolish, least the adversary <line> <line>triumph and say; fickle their state whom god <line> <line>most favors, who can please him long; mee first <line> <line>he ruind, now mankind; whom will he next? <line> <line>matter of scorne, not to be given the foe, <line> <line>however i with thee have fixt my lot, <line> <line>certain to undergoe like doom, if death <line> <line>consort with thee, death is to mee as life; <line> <line>so forcible within my heart i feel <line> <line>the bond of nature draw me to my owne, <line> <line>my own in thee, for what thou art is mine; <line> <line>our state cannot be severd, we are one, <line> <line>one flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self. <line> <line>so adam, and thus eve to him repli'd. <line> <line>o glorious trial of exceeding love, <line> <line>illustrious evidence, example high! <line> <line>ingaging me to emulate, but short <line> <line>of thy perfection, how shall i attaine, <line> <line>adam, from whose deare side i boast me sprung, <line> <line>and gladly of our union heare thee speak, <line> <line>one heart, one soul in both; whereof good prooff <line> <line>this day affords, declaring thee resolvd, <line> <line>rather then death or aught then death more dread <line> <line>shall separate us, linkt in love so deare, <line> <line>to undergoe with mee one guilt, one crime, <line> <line>if any be, of tasting this fair fruit, <line> <line>whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds, <line> <line>direct, or by occasion hath presented <line> <line>this happie trial of thy love, which else <line> <line>so eminently never had bin known. <line> <line>were it i thought death menac't would ensue <line> <line>this my attempt, i would sustain alone <line> <line>the worst, and not perswade thee, rather die <line> <line>deserted, then oblige thee with a fact <line> <line>pernicious to thy peace, chiefly assur'd <line> <line>remarkably so late of thy so true, <line> <line>so faithful love unequald; but i feel <line> <line>farr otherwise th' event, not death, but life <line> <line>augmented, op'nd eyes, new hopes, new joyes, <line> <line>taste so divine, that what of sweet before <line> <line>hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh. <line> <line>on my experience, adam, freely taste, <line> <line>and fear of death deliver to the windes. <line> <line>so saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy <line> <line>tenderly wept, much won that he his love <line> <line>had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr <line> <line>divine displeasure for her sake, or death. <line> <line>in recompence (for such compliance bad <line> <line>such recompence best merits) from the bough <line> <line>she gave him of that fair enticing fruit <line> <line>with liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat <line> <line>against his better knowledge, not deceav'd, <line> <line>but fondly overcome with femal charm. <line> <line>earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again <line> <line>in pangs, and nature gave a second groan, <line> <line>skie lowr'd and muttering thunder, som sad drops <line> <line>wept at compleating of the mortal sin <line> <line>original; while adam took no thought, <line> <line>eating his fill, nor eve to iterate <line> <line>her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe <line> <line>him with her lov'd societie, that now <line> <line>as with new wine intoxicated both <line> <line>they swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel <line> <line>divinitie within them breeding wings <line> <line>wherewith to scorne the earth: but that false fruit <line> <line>farr other operation first displaid, <line> <line>carnal desire enflaming, hee on eve <line> <line>began to cast lascivious eyes, she him <line> <line>as wantonly repaid; in lust they burne: <line> <line>till adam thus'gan eve to dalliance move,eve, now i see thou art exact of taste, <line> <line>and elegant, of sapience no small part, <line> <line>since to each meaning savour we apply, <line> <line>and palate call judicious; i the praise <line> <line>yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd. <line> <line>much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd <line> <line>from this delightful fruit, nor known till now <line> <line>true relish, tasting;

10050,1118,"<line> <line>long before the fresh apple crisis, my life had some form to it. i would wake in the mornings—i would perform something. for example, the day i tried, as one with acute passion might, to win one woman over but accidentally won another—that whole time i had been living like someone. though i can’t remember his name. his model of optimism provided me with a certain geography that i inhabit in time of need. this time the need was surprising. people tend to have faith that the juice they drink in the morning is the same juice they have always drunk. and apples take their shape naturally. the guy, whose name escapes me now, taught me to look upon others’ concerns as mine to make at home. i was fond of doing many things at home, but my favorite was drinking juice. when my friends came by—they liked to suddenly show up with all kinds of breads in their hands, thinking they knew what i needed and planning to force it on me—i had to tell them i was busy with my juice. two weeks before the crisis, i had been writing some poems about it. it was a warm day, not entirely different from other warm days in san francisco. people were on the street. pale people were on the street, making it to the park and lying there such that the next day they were a little browned. the poems i had written were failures, but dense ones. it seemed appropriate to think the person’s attempt at wholeness was a series of missteps, which if drawn across an afternoon might prove interesting to other people. i had a way of reminding my friends that we were all in pain, but a fruit tart kind of pain strangers can’t help but enjoy. that day i had, in a sense, gathered all my possessions and gone out onto the street with them. i awoke that morning with an urgency to prepare myself for something—not anything life threatening, but definitely personal. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>my lover, then, wanted to spend much of her life asleep. she had no ostensible reaction to the city’s sudden depletion of all its fresh apples and no hope for them. in a world where a person’s tastes revolve around the kind of sleep she gets, i could not find four people who cared. i thought that if i could find those four people we could really do something. a few of my friends pretended they were chosen. a few neighbors felt bad and made offers. my mother called to console me. my lover—in actuality, the closest person to being a member of the encumbered troop, slept next to me. sleep became our network: falling in and out of it for change. the rule of survival is that no two people can lie in the same bed and sleep at the same time. so i kept an eye on her and played this game of freshness. if by morning i could quickly run out and do seven things that did not involve longing, she would reward me. before the crisis, the reward would have needed only to be an apple one. but after the apples were gone. the landscape usually contains the solution to what’s lost. demographics help people in cars. some people did not notice me. some demographers lose sleep and do not notice me. that was two days before. the evening before it was two days before the crisis, i was thinking that i did not think i was asleep. i had been watching the sunlight take the corner of my room and my housemate’s cat in it. when i looked again, there was no light—but i had not been asleep. it’s the way people react to traumatic events. they say, “i had just been there” or will say, “she was just with me.” so the loss of light was emotional and the lost state—demographic. i began to trace things by their disappearance. alone in the room, my memory, and anticipated darkness going for light. people like to talk about the daytime. people in strange moods often miss the daytime. before the crisis it was not often that one would find me in strange moods. i had managed a particular kind of balance fortified by a certain satisfaction of taste. i was happy. i mean, i was in my juice. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>five weeks before the crisis, i was employed at the natural foods grocery around the corner from my house. i did not really work there, but i went there every week. all but the third sunday of each month, i would walk in and find all kinds of juice on sale. not to buy, but to stand next to. shorter people have the privilege of proximity to most cardboard signs. that was one thing. i would stand there and be something for taller people who couldn’t see. i had gotten into the habit of improvised customer service as a way to peruse the juice aisles without being noticed. my parents thought my talents should have led me somewhere. my father would always say, “if you’re not going to be a people person, then numbers will have to do.” he was surprised that with all the time i had on my hands, i chose to spend most of it alone. numbers then did hold some mystery for me, but mostly too high and far-reaching to explore. for years i had known that if there was a wall between where i was and where i needed to be, i did not want it there. some people have personal goals that are demanding. certain goals make it impossible to lounge around in bed. my decision to drink only fresh juice, which costs as much as a small satisfying breakfast, kept me busy rounding up cash. i would have to leave most friendships behind. as a way of keeping my life “wall-free,” i had to divide my time. i would spend the first part of the day searching for volunteer positions in organic juice factories. the second part of my day i would spend telling people about the first part. the other parts are not of substance here. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>twenty-five years before the crisis i had for the first time what would eventually become known to me as apple juice. twenty-three years later a magazine editor would reject my first attempt to recount that experience in litany. i am always drinking in my poems, a good friend says. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>in the first years of my life, everything i ate was mush. today i will tolerate only the toughest of green vegetables and date people who will always forget this. when i had that remarkable glass of apple juice, i had no idea that one day i simply would not be able to find it. the city gets rid of its apples. people find themselves inventing fruit. the day i decided to write poems about it—it was twelve days before the rumors began and fourteen days before the media coverage—i had been resting in my best friend’s easy chair. we were discussing the rise of the smoothie industry when something fantastic occurred to me. five days later i had twenty poems. when a person writes a poem about her passions, people on the street are bound to notice them. the passions overwhelm the body. she carries the body as though it were the book. the friend whose easy chair gave way to my failures moved out of town the next week, and though i miss her it was the failures that saved me. on every other day any kind of crisis one finds particular sayings helpful. if certain words are spoken quietly into a cup of hot water, with the handle of the cup turned toward the wall, whatever strength found in the person may be mirrored in the wall. the person leaves the house with her hand against this wall but strutting slightly. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>in the alley behind the natural foods grocery, i met my second lover for the first time. meeting people in vulnerable places accentuates the passion later. or it may be so hot that the lover never thinks in the present. and the weather was so hot during the crisis. only the alleys had shade. forty-eight days into the crisis, while on a thirst strike, i had to make a run for the alley. not as though people were after me, but the elements. the foundation of anyone feeling that they must get away is need; at the bottom of any body-based need is grace. when i appeared at the opening of the alley, a woman who not twenty-four hours later would be dozing in my bed was stacking crates against the east-side wall. women who work against surfaces inspire me to do things—i thought about telling her, or—short women make me want things. all the time while i was growing up i put a lot of demands on my juice; forty-eight days into the crisis she made me forget it. i did not forget it, but was embroiled. the newspapers were saying things about the past. people were celebrating thick juice, and i kept writing those poems. that day in the alley i realized three things about life. while assisting her i learned three things to carry around with me, to disperse when needed. for six months during the crisis, i did not care about the crisis. <line> <line> <line> <line> <line> <line>when my faith returned all my lovers were gone. that morning i woke to the two hundred and thirty-second day of the crisis; i was beneath my bed. it was the sixth day that i had awakened beneath my bed. i was lonely, but i was also sure. life without juice had taken on the name and shape of my weakest character, who—when we passed on the street—did not know me. i knew it was me by the way my head felt: people find themselves in an idea and feel so specified by the idea that they are compelled to show it. today all my ideas are liquid. that day of my faith, friends thinking i was sick came by to see me. it would be the last day i spent alone; i was happy, but still would not drink. the juice on my mind was no longer juice. there was an absence there, but one so constant it became familiar. i did not want to drink it. <line>","living,life choices,the mind,love,realistic & complicated,activities,eating & drinking,arts & sciences,poetry & poets"

yellow! yellow!” coffee steam rises in a stream, clouds the silver tea-service with mist, and twists up into the sunlight, revolved, involuted, suspiring higher and higher, fluting in a thin spiral up the high blue sky. a crow flies by and croaks at the coffee steam. the day is new and fair with good smells in the air. walk over the street the white clouds meet, and sheer away without touching. on the sidewalks, boys are playing marbles. glass marbles, with amber and blue hearts, roll together and part with a sweet clashing noise. the boys strike them with black and red striped agates. the glass marbles spit crimson when they are hit, and slip into the gutters under rushing brown water. i smell tulips and narcissus in the air, but there are no flowers anywhere, only white dust whipping up the street, and a girl with a gay spring hat and blowing skirts. the dust and the wind flirt at her ankles and her neat, high-heeled patent leather shoes. tap, tap, the little heels pat the pavement, and the wind rustles among the flowers on her hat. a water-cart crawls slowly on the other side of the way. it is green and gay with new paint, and rumbles contentedly, sprinkling clear water over the white dust. clear zigzagging water, which smells of tulips and narcissus. the thickening branches make a pink grisaille against the blue sky. whoop! the clouds go dashing at each other and sheer away just in time. whoop! and a man’s hat careers down the street in front of the white dust, leaps into the branches of a tree, veers away and trundles ahead of the wind, jarring the sunlight into spokes of rose-colour and green. a motor-car cuts a swathe through the bright air, sharp-beaked, irresistible, shouting to the wind to make way. a glare of dust and sunshine tosses together behind it, and settles down. the sky is quiet and high, and the morning is fair with fresh-washed air. midday and afternoon swirl of crowded streets. shock and recoil of traffic. the stock-still brick façade of an old church, against which the waves of people lurch and withdraw. flare of sunshine down side-streets. eddies of light in the windows of chemists’ shops, with their blue, gold, purple jars, darting colours far into the crowd. loud bangs and tremors, murmurings out of high windows, whirring of machine belts, blurring of horses and motors. a quick spin and shudder of brakes on an electric car, and the jar of a church-bell knocking against the metal blue of the sky. i am a piece of the town, a bit of blown dust, thrust along with the crowd. proud to feel the pavement under me, reeling with feet. feet tripping, skipping, lagging, dragging, plodding doggedly, or springing up and advancing on firm elastic insteps. a boy is selling papers, i smell them clean and new from the press. they are fresh like the air, and pungent as tulips and narcissus. the blue sky pales to lemon, and great tongues of gold blind the shop-windows, putting out their contents in a flood of flame. night and sleep the day takes her ease in slippered yellow. electric signs gleam out along the shop fronts, following each other. they grow, and grow, and blow into patterns of fire-flowers as the sky fades. trades scream in spots of light at the unruffled night. twinkle, jab, snap, that means a new play; and over the way: plop, drop, quiver, is the sidelong sliver of a watchmaker’s sign with its length on another street. a gigantic mug of beer effervesces to the atmosphere over a tall building, but the sky is high and has her own stars, why should she heed ours? i leave the city with speed. wheels whirl to take me back to my trees and my quietness. the breeze which blows with me is fresh-washed and clean, it has come but recently from the high sky. there are no flowers in bloom yet, but the earth of my garden smells of tulips and narcissus. my room is tranquil and friendly. out of the window i can see the distant city, a band of twinkling gems, little flower-heads with no stems. i cannot see the beer-glass, nor the letters of the restaurants and shops i passed, now the signs blur and all together make the city, glowing on a night of fine weather, like a garden stirring and blowing for the spring. the night is fresh-washed and fair and there is a whiff of flowers in the air. wrap me close, sheets of lavender. pour your blue and purple dreams into my ears. the breeze whispers at the shutters and mutters queer tales of old days, and cobbled streets, and youths leaping their horses down marble stairways. pale blue lavender, you are the colour of the sky when it is fresh-washed and fair . . . i smell the stars . . . they are like tulips and narcissus . . . i smell them in the air. <line>","life choices,activities,eating & drinking,nature,spring,stars, planets, heavens,trees & flowers,social commentaries,cities & urban life"

(still here i carry my old delicious burdens, i carry them, men and women, i carry them with me wherever i go, i swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them, i am fill’d with them, and i will fill them in return.) 2 you road i enter upon and look around, i believe you are not all that is here, i believe that much unseen is also here. here the profound lesson of reception, nor preference nor denial, the black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas’d, the illiterate person, are not denied; the birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar’s tramp, the drunkard’s stagger, the laughing party of mechanics, the escaped youth, the rich person’s carriage, the fop, the eloping couple, the early market-man, the hearse, the moving of furniture into the town, the return back from the town, they pass, i also pass, any thing passes, none can be interdicted, none but are accepted, none but shall be dear to me. 3 you air that serves me with breath to speak! you objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them shape! you light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable showers! you paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides! i believe you are latent with unseen existences, you are so dear to me. you flagg’d walks of the cities! you strong curbs at the edges! you ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timber-lined sides! you distant ships! you rows of houses! you window-pierc’d façades! you roofs! you porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards! you windows whose transparent shells might expose so much! you doors and ascending steps! you arches! you gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden crossings! from all that has touch’d you i believe you have imparted to yourselves, and now would impart the same secretly to me, from the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive surfaces, and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable with me. 4 the earth expanding right hand and left hand, the picture alive, every part in its best light, the music falling in where it is wanted, and stopping where it is not wanted, the cheerful voice of the public road, the gay fresh sentiment of the road. o highway i travel, do you say to me do not leave me? do you say venture not—if you leave me you are lost? do you say i am already prepared, i am well-beaten and undenied, adhere to me? o public road, i say back i am not afraid to leave you, yet i love you, you express me better than i can express myself, you shall be more to me than my poem. i think heroic deeds were all conceiv’d in the open air, and all free poems also, i think i could stop here myself and do miracles, i think whatever i shall meet on the road i shall like, and whoever beholds me shall like me, i think whoever i see must be happy. 5 from this hour i ordain myself loos’d of limits and imaginary lines, going where i list, my own master total and absolute, listening to others, considering well what they say, pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating, gently,but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that would hold me. i inhale great draughts of space, the east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are mine. i am larger, better than i thought, i did not know i held so much goodness. all seems beautiful to me, i can repeat over to men and women you have done such good to me i would do the same to you, i will recruit for myself and you as i go, i will scatter myself among men and women as i go, i will toss a new gladness and roughness among them, whoever denies me it shall not trouble me, whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me. 6 now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me, now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear’d it would not astonish me. now i see the secret of the making of the best persons, it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth. here a great personal deed has room, (such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men, its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all authority and all argument against it.) here is the test of wisdom, wisdom is not finally tested in schools, wisdom cannot be pass’d from one having it to another not having it, wisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own proof, applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content, is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and the excellence of things; something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes it out of the soul. now i re-examine philosophies and religions, they may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at all under the spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents. here is realization, here is a man tallied—he realizes here what he has in him, the past, the future, majesty, love—if they are vacant of you, you are vacant of them. only the kernel of every object nourishes; where is he who tears off the husks for you and me? where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me? here is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion’d, it is apropos; do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers? do you know the talk of those turning eye-balls? 7 here is the efflux of the soul, the efflux of the soul comes from within through embower’d gates, ever provoking questions, these yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness why are they? why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight expands my blood? why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank? why are there trees i never walk under but large and melodious thoughts descend upon me? (i think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always drop fruit as i pass;) what is it i interchange so suddenly with strangers? what with some driver as i ride on the seat by his side? what with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as i walk by and pause? what gives me to be free to a woman’s and man’s good-will? what gives them to be free to mine? 8 the efflux of the soul is happiness, here is happiness, i think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times, now it flows unto us, we are rightly charged. here rises the fluid and attaching character, the fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of man and woman, (the herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day out of the roots of themselves, than it sprouts fresh and sweet continually out of itself.) toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the love of young and old, from it falls distill’d the charm that mocks beauty and attainments, toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact. 9 allons! whoever you are come travel with me! traveling with me you find what never tires. the earth never tires, the earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first, nature is rude and incomprehensible at first, be not discouraged, keep on, there are divine things well envelop’d, i swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can tell. allons! we must not stop here, however sweet these laid-up stores, however convenient this dwelling we cannot remain here, however shelter’d this port and however calm these waters we must not anchor here, however welcome the hospitality that surrounds us we are permitted to receive it but a little while. 10 allons! the inducements shall be greater, we will sail pathless and wild seas, we will go where winds blow, waves dash, and the yankee clipper speeds by under full sail. allons! with power, liberty, the earth, the elements, health, defiance, gayety, self-esteem, curiosity; allons! from all formules! from your formules, o bat-eyed and materialistic priests. the stale cadaver blocks up the passage—the burial waits no longer. allons! yet take warning! he traveling with me needs the best blood, thews, endurance, none may come to the trial till he or she bring courage and health, come not here if you have already spent the best of yourself, only those may come who come in sweet and determin’d bodies, no diseas’d person, no rum-drinker or venereal taint is permitted here. (i and mine do not convince by arguments, similes, rhymes, we convince by our presence.) 11 listen! i will be honest with you, i do not offer the old smooth prizes, but offer rough new prizes, these are the days that must happen to you: you shall not heap up what is call’d riches, you shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve, you but arrive at the city to which you were destin’d, you hardly settle yourself to satisfaction before you are call’d by an irresistible call to depart, you shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those who remain behind you, what beckonings of love you receive you shall only answer with passionate kisses of parting, you shall not allow the hold of those who spread their reach’d hands toward you. 12 allons! after the great companions, and to belong to them! they too are on the road—they are the swift and majestic men—they are the greatest women, enjoyers of calms of seas and storms of seas, sailors of many a ship, walkers of many a mile of land, habituès of many distant countries, habituès of far-distant dwellings, trusters of men and women, observers of cities, solitary toilers, pausers and contemplators of tufts, blossoms, shells of the shore, dancers at wedding-dances, kissers of brides, tender helpers of children, bearers of children, soldiers of revolts, standers by gaping graves, lowerers-down of coffins, journeyers over consecutive seasons, over the years, the curious years each emerging from that which preceded it, journeyers as with companions, namely their own diverse phases, forth-steppers from the latent unrealized baby-days, journeyers gayly with their own youth, journeyers with their bearded and well-grain’d manhood, journeyers with their womanhood, ample, unsurpass’d, content, journeyers with their own sublime old age of manhood or womanhood, old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth of the universe, old age, flowing free with the delicious near-by freedom of death. 13 allons! to that which is endless as it was beginningless, to undergo much, tramps of days, rests of nights, to merge all in the travel they tend to, and the days and nights they tend to, again to merge them in the start of superior journeys, to see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it and pass it, to conceive no time, however distant, but what you may reach it and pass it, to look up or down no road but it stretches and waits for you, however long but it stretches and waits for you, to see no being, not god’s or any, but you also go thither, to see no possession but you may possess it, enjoying all without labor or purchase, abstracting the feast yet not abstracting one particle of it, to take the best of the farmer’s farm and the rich man’s elegant villa, and the chaste blessings of the well-married couple, and the fruits of orchards and flowers of gardens, to take to your use out of the compact cities as you pass through, to carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever you go, to gather the minds of men out of their brains as you encounter them, to gather the love out of their hearts, to take your lovers on the road with you, for all that you leave them behind you, to know the universe itself as a road, as many roads, as roads for traveling souls. all parts away for the progress of souls, all religion, all solid things, arts, governments—all that was or is apparent upon this globe or any globe, falls into niches and corners before the procession of souls along the grand roads of the universe. of the progress of the souls of men and women along the grand roads of the universe, all other progress is the needed emblem and sustenance. forever alive, forever forward, stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn, baffled, mad, turbulent, feeble, dissatisfied, desperate, proud, fond, sick, accepted by men, rejected by men, they go! they go! i know that they go, but i know not where they go, but i know that they go toward the best—toward something great. whoever you are, come forth! or man or woman come forth! you must not stay sleeping and dallying there in the house, though you built it, or though it has been built for you. out of the dark confinement! out from behind the screen! it is useless to protest, i know all and expose it. behold through you as bad as the rest, through the laughter, dancing, dining, supping, of people, inside of dresses and ornaments, inside of those wash’d and trimm’d faces, behold a secret silent loathing and despair. no husband, no wife, no friend, trusted to hear the confession, another self, a duplicate of every one, skulking and hiding it goes, formless and wordless through the streets of the cities, polite and bland in the parlors, in the cars of railroads, in steamboats, in the public assembly, home to the houses of men and women, at the table, in the bedroom, everywhere, smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright, death under the breast-bones, hell under the skull-bones, under the broadcloth and gloves, under the ribbons and artificial flowers, keeping fair with the customs, speaking not a syllable of itself, speaking of any thing else but never of itself. 14 allons! through struggles and wars! the goal that was named cannot be countermanded. have the past struggles succeeded? what has succeeded? yourself? your nation? nature? now understand me well—it is provided in the essence of things that from any fruition of success, no matter what, shall come forth something to make a greater struggle necessary. my call is the call of battle, i nourish active rebellion, he going with me must go well arm’d, he going with me goes often with spare diet, poverty, angry enemies, desertions. 15 allons! the road is before us! it is safe—i have tried it—my own feet have tried it well—be not detain’d! let the paper remain on the desk unwritten, and the book on the shelf unopen’d! let the tools remain in the workshop! let the money remain unearn’d! let the school stand! mind not the cry of the teacher! let the preacher preach in his pulpit! let the lawyer plead in the court, and the judge expound the law. camerado, i give you my hand! i give you my love more precious than money, i give you myself before preaching or law; will you give me yourself? will you come travel with me? shall we stick by each other as long as we live? <line>","activities,travels & journeys"

10779,13087,"<line> <line>there was a roaring in the wind all night; the rain came heavily and fell in floods; but now the sun is rising calm and bright; the birds are singing in the distant woods; over his own sweet voice the stock-dove broods; the jay makes answer as the magpie chatters; and all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters. all things that love the sun are out of doors; the sky rejoices in the morning's birth; the grass is bright with rain-drops;—on the moors the hare is running races in her mirth; and with her feet she from the plashy earth raises a mist, that, glittering in the sun, runs with her all the way, wherever she doth run. i was a traveller then upon the moor; i saw the hare that raced about with joy; i heard the woods and distant waters roar; or heard them not, as happy as a boy: the pleasant season did my heart employ: my old remembrances went from me wholly; and all the ways of men, so vain and melancholy. but, as it sometimes chanceth, from the might of joys in minds that can no further go, as high as we have mounted in delight in our dejection do we sink as low; to me that morning did it happen so; and fears and fancies thick upon me came; dim sadness—and blind thoughts, i knew not, nor could name. i heard the sky-lark warbling in the sky; and i bethought me of the playful hare: even such a happy child of earth am i; even as these blissful creatures do i fare; far from the world i walk, and from all care; but there may come another day to me— solitude, pain of heart, distress, and poverty. my whole life i have lived in pleasant thought, as if life's business were a summer mood; as if all needful things would come unsought to genial faith, still rich in genial good; but how can he expect that others should build for him, sow for him, and at his call love him, who for himself will take no heed at all? i thought of chatterton, the marvellous boy, the sleepless soul that perished in his pride; of him who walked in glory and in joy following his plough, along the mountain-side: by our own spirits are we deified: we poets in our youth begin in gladness; but thereof come in the end despondency and madness. now, whether it were by peculiar grace, a leading from above, a something given, yet it befell that, in this lonely place, when i with these untoward thoughts had striven, beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven i saw a man before me unawares: the oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs. as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence; wonder to all who do the same espy, by what means it could thither come, and whence; so that it seems a thing endued with sense: like a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself; such seemed this man, not all alive nor dead, nor all asleep—in his extreme old age: his body was bent double, feet and head coming together in life's pilgrimage; as if some dire constraint of pain, or rage of sickness felt by him in times long past, a more than human weight upon his frame had cast. himself he propped, limbs, body, and pale face, upon a long grey staff of shaven wood: and, still as i drew near with gentle pace, upon the margin of that moorish flood motionless as a cloud the old man stood, that heareth not the loud winds when they call, and moveth all together, if it move at all. at length, himself unsettling, he the pond stirred with his staff, and fixedly did look upon the muddy water, which he conned, as if he had been reading in a book: and now a stranger's privilege i took; and, drawing to his side, to him did say, ""this morning gives us promise of a glorious day."" a gentle answer did the old man make, in courteous speech which forth he slowly drew: and him with further words i thus bespake, ""what occupation do you there pursue? this is a lonesome place for one like you."" ere he replied, a flash of mild surprise broke from the sable orbs of his yet-vivid eyes. his words came feebly, from a feeble chest, but each in solemn order followed each, with something of a lofty utterance drest— choice word and measured phrase, above the reach of ordinary men; a stately speech; such as grave livers do in scotland use, religious men, who give to god and man their dues. he told, that to these waters he had come to gather leeches, being old and poor: employment hazardous and wearisome! and he had many hardships to endure: from pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor; housing, with god's good help, by choice or chance; and in this way he gained an honest maintenance. the old man still stood talking by my side; but now his voice to me was like a stream scarce heard; nor word from word could i divide; and the whole body of the man did seem like one whom i had met with in a dream; or like a man from some far region sent, to give me human strength, by apt admonishment. my former thoughts returned: the fear that kills; and hope that is unwilling to be fed; cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills; and mighty poets in their misery dead. —perplexed, and longing to be comforted, my question eagerly did i renew, ""how is it that you live, and what is it you do?"" he with a smile did then his words repeat; and said that, gathering leeches, far and wide he travelled; stirring thus about his feet the waters of the pools where they abide. ""once i could meet with them on every side; but they have dwindled long by slow decay; yet still i persevere, and find them where i may."" while he was talking thus, the lonely place, the old man's shape, and speech—all troubled me: in my mind's eye i seemed to see him pace about the weary moors continually, wandering about alone and silently. while i these thoughts within myself pursued, he, having made a pause, the same discourse renewed. and soon with this he other matter blended, cheerfully uttered, with demeanour kind, but stately in the main; and, when he ended, i could have laughed myself to scorn to find in that decrepit man so firm a mind. ""god,"" said i, ""be my help and stay secure; i'll think of the leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!"" <line>","living,the mind,activities,jobs & working,travels & journeys,nature,landscapes & pastorals,arts & sciences,poetry & poets"

what is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us? whatever it is, it avails not—distance avails not, and place avails not, i too lived, brooklyn of ample hills was mine, i too walk’d the streets of manhattan island, and bathed in the waters around it, i too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me, in the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me, in my walks home late at night or as i lay in my bed they came upon me, i too had been struck from the float forever held in solution, i too had receiv’d identity by my body, that i was i knew was of my body, and what i should be i knew i should be of my body. 6 it is not upon you alone the dark patches fall, the dark threw its patches down upon me also, the best i had done seem’d to me blank and suspicious, my great thoughts as i supposed them, were they not in reality meagre? nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil, i am he who knew what it was to be evil, i too knitted the old knot of contrariety, blabb’d, blush’d, resented, lied, stole, grudg’d, had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes i dared not speak, was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant, the wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me, the cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting, refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting, was one with the rest, the days and haps of the rest, was call’d by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me approaching or passing, felt their arms on my neck as i stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as i sat, saw many i loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a word, lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping, play’d the part that still looks back on the actor or actress, the same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like, or as small as we like, or both great and small. 7 closer yet i approach you, what thought you have of me now, i had as much of you—i laid in my stores in advance, i consider’d long and seriously of you before you were born. who was to know what should come home to me?

the tree was growing while i sat on it <line> <line> <line> <line>as were the other pitch pines round the pond ruddy <line> <line>in afternoon, late light of day, rough trunks <line> <line>with tufts of twisted branches green with needles, <line> <line>it was idyllic, wind speaking through the pines, <line> <line> <line> <line>** <line> <line> <line> <line>solitude:—o, yes, two high-breasted girls <line> <line>came striding by, i heard them coming, i <line> <line>heard them going, yammering at full volume <line> <line>not looking left or right, they passed me, were <line> <line> <line> <line>out of sight and soon of earshot, doppler effect <line> <line>caused by exuberant youth in oblivious chitchat. <line> <line>and people are smoking in these dry woods too, <line> <line>not policing their butts is how i know, <line> <line> <line> <line>the butts will surface from the heavier, sifting sand, <line> <line>sand spilling, surfing down hills, crashing in waves <line> <line>over the path here. but call it solitude, <line> <line>when a thought—but wait! i thought—i should not be <line> <line> <line> <line>** <line> <line> <line> <line>having a thought here, this moment: yet a vision <line> <line>of a chinese poet in his study overlooking <line> <line>such a pond as this arrives out of the silence <line> <line>like the yellow water lilies on the water, pads <line> <line> <line> <line>spreading out in files like a design on the broadloom <line> <line>of a lobby. the sage is working on a poem, brushing it <line> <line>on silk, inspired by a blend of tao and <line> <line>confucius. doubtless he would not forget <line> <line> <line> <line>allusions to sung poets, if he were not <line> <line>a sung poet himself, in which case he would have to <line> <line>echo han or t’ang;

it wants a deity, an altar to approach; <line> <line>an altar at least to take steps toward; occasion <line> <line>to rise to—with nothing planned for the mind, <line> <line> <line> <line>** <line> <line> <line> <line>it’s like a person suddenly blind, not blind <line> <line>for a long time and knowing the ropes, but just <line> <line>now, rope-stung, blind—and groping, feeling around <line> <line>for the way, any way, or, closer to home, <line> <line> <line> <line>when the power goes at night just getting from <line> <line>here to there even though you know the drill, <line> <line>—you never find the batteries when you need them, <line> <line>groping down cellar for the circuit breaker then <line> <line> <line> <line>you flip it; nothing, it’s a bigger failure you are part of— <line> <line>know the layout in general yet without ceremony <line> <line>the mind leans forward, over an edge, hoping for, <line> <line>needing a little ritual, like a guide rail to keep it <line> <line> <line> <line>** <line> <line> <line> <line>from falling, going down. even then the mind <line> <line>finds need of other news, keeps on desiring <line> <line>alterity somewhere at hand. for example, <line> <line>walking the streets of provincetown, nothing to see <line> <line> <line> <line>but lots to look at, all that fluff and buff, <line> <line>the michelin-man day-trippers aching along; <line> <line>suddenly i want a prayer book, maybe notbottles and stools or the little red book but still . . . <line> <line> <line> <line>even a pocket copy of a shropshire lad, <line> <line>such as i find soon after all the buff and fluff <line> <line>at tim’s, the only bookstore on the street, <line> <line>handy for quick reads. thin as a shortbread biscuit, <line> <line> <line> <line>** <line> <line> <line> <line>the richards press london 1915, no doubt <line> <line>with its khaki cover, intended for some tommy’s <line> <line>backpack, a backward solace for off-duty hours <line> <line>in the trenches: admittedly not very much <line> <line> <line> <line>on the other hand just the thing i’m talking after; <line> <line>a talisman perhaps is all, an amulet <line> <line>with words that say, buck up, come on, you’ll make it,there’s something on after all this, no matter <line> <line> <line> <line>what the words say. housman’s “vision,” his drear <line> <line>anguish of love for someone, something, lad <line> <line>and landscape that never were, that might shoot threads <line> <line>of gold among the bloody muslins and the mud;

other; that <line> <line> <line> <line>no bullet, arrowwood or beach plum might <line> <line>fill, though these could occupy that space <line> <line>a moment. <line> <line> again i heard the casual chirping <line> <line>of that bird, off in that tupelo, the song <line> <line> <line> <line>i did not know, below the cries of gull <line> <line>and jay i did. the unknown i saw was not <line> <line>enough to satisfy; or—satisfied when it <line> <line>was framed, complement of what is known for sure. <line> <line> <line> <line>** <line> <line> <line> <line>it’s—like—when you go someplace strange, new, <line> <line>the seashore, any boundary, you want to learn the names <line> <line>of plants. start looking at the edges of leaves. it gives <line> <line>a grip on where you are, and who, or seems to, <line> <line> <line> <line>to know bullbrier, bearberry, blueberry. you get a guide <line> <line>or a local to tell. on the dune path i found one, a gnarled <line> <line>bush alone, hollylike but succulent leaf;
